can guarantee that these same fiends incarnate have become phosed
and changed all of a sudden ; or that the handful of liheral Turks at Con-
stantinople are capable of controlling and restrainirs them. We hav not
even heard that the leaders and participators of the last massacres have
been Dunished as they deserved ; and what is the reason they are left un-

one single in stance of Turkish woman or child maltreated by Armenians ?
The last massacres though especially organized from the Talace at
Constantinople, were officially announced to originate front an Affray

Ahmed Riza Bey in the first part (Ses Causes) of his book " La Crise de
L'Orient" published in Paris in 1907 holds a brief for his nation which
through its own fallacious arguments falls to the ground. I will quote one,
