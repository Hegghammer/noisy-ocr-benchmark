THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
ating
TREATY OF BERLIN
Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe at the famous
cougres of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the still more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
parallel in history.
In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Goyernments of Europe,
but in the interests of Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin written in letters of blood

It was a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of "the
terrible stronghold of Kars," universally admitted to be one of the greatest
and most difficult military exploits ever achieved, and the crowning success
V
of the Russian arms in Asiatic Turke should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General that although Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest, and Armenian soldiers fought, conquered and
died, yet by these successes not only/was no amelioration attained of the
hard fate of their unhapp, nation under Turkish Trule, but that fate, hard
before, was made a hundredfolo and even a thousandfold harder.
