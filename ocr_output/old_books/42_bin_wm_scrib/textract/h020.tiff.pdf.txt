much that is now in darkness, and must forever remain hidden from
the generations of the living.
At the death of Jonathan G. Horton, the old homestead became,
by will, the property of the Rev. Mrs. Williams, of Brooklyn, N. Y.,

Horton name, suitably repaired and preserved for the wonder and
admiration of generations of Hortons yet unborn. Jonathan G.
