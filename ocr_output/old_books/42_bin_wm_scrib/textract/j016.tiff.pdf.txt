the second step.
Step 3. This step is a repetition of the first two. The canes o
this series run over the first and second series and parallel with the
first. As each strand used up bind the end by pulling it under
a cane, crossing from one hole to another underneath the frame
and cutting off about 1/4 in. from the cane, Fig. 5 shows how this
binding is done. The loose end at the starting point is tied in thi
way, and all subseguent ones should be tied as they come, thu
avoiding interference by many pegs, and insuring neat binding.

Step 4. The actual weaving begins with this step. It may b
done entirely by hand, without resort to the needle, but it is slov 1
work. The needle should be used. Start at a hole next to a corner

of canes. Continue until all canes are paired and all holes used.
