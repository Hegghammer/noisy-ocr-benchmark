CHAPTER VI
REED AND SPLINT WEAVREC
Reeds which are used extensively for basket-making and weaving
in general are procured from the species of palm described in Chap-
ter I. These reeds should not be confused with the term reed
applied to several distinct species of large water loving grasses.
Such reeds are usually designated under the name of grasses. There
are a thousand species of palm distributed over the tropical regions
of the entire world, but only a few are native in the United States,
and these are of no distinct commercial value. The rattan or cane
palms of India and the Malay Islands grow to an unusual height,
and are imported into this country in great quantities. These rat-
tans and the trailing palm of the species Calamus have as main
export centers Singapore and Calcutta. These palms are stripped
of leaves and bark and split into round and flat strips of different
diameters and widths. The outer bark, when stripped into proper
Z
sizes, is known as chair cane; the entire palm, with leaves removed,
is commercially known as rattan and the flat reeds are frequently
sold as flat. rattan and pith cane. Inasmuch as these flat and round
strips, split from the palm plant and exported under the name of
rattan are called reeds, we shall refer to them under that name in
all discussions to follow. There are two qualities of reed on the
market sold under the names of China reed and German feed "he
former is inferior in quality and the latter is superior, being strong,
B!
tough and durable. The Philippine Islands promise of pro-
ducing a liberal supply of reed of good quality that is claimed to
equal the German product. The problem, however, is one of gath-
ering and marketing the product. The government has made a
partial survey of the rattan supply this justifies the belief that
thé Lslands will eventually compete with the world market.
