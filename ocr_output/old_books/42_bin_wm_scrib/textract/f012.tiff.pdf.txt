PREFACE
from Smith, who himself was prone to include
the most extraragant myths in his pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE LIVES AND ACTIONS OF THE FAMOUS
HIGHWAYMEN. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the "truth" of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.
No one has ever reprinted those withors in
their original extravagance, or their grossness.
It would be impossible; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
them, or even written an independent history of
the highwaymen. When we conside how astonish-
ingly popular those romances have ever been
which have had Clarde Du Tall, and Turpin,
and their like for heroes. this is not a little
surprising
Z
Perhap the task has been abandoned because
of the dificulty-the almost insuperable difficulty
sifting fact from fiction, and because of a
chilling sense that it would be a thankless task
to present the highwayman as he really was/
a
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No movelist would
B1
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dis-
service; and I do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in be widely read.
