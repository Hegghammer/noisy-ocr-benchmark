THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.

having only her kirtle upon her back. John Gower, howerer, wh
wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus describes a camp of
ladies. They were, says he, " clothed all alike, in With rich capes
or mantles, parti-coloured, white, and blue, embrordered all over with
varreus devices." Their bodies are described as being long and small,
and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though each of them
had been a queen. We find that the tight-laced young ladies of the
court of the Lady Triamore "had mantles of green-coloured velvet,
handsomely bordered with gold, and lined with rich furs. Their heads
were neatly attired in kerchiefs, and were ornamented with cut work and
richly-striped wires of gold, and upon their kerchiefs they had each of
them pretty coronal, embellished with sixty gems or more;" and of
their pretty mistress it is said in the same poem, that her cheeks were as
red as the rose when it first blossoms. Her hair shone upon her head
like golden wire, falling beneath a crown of gold richly ornamented with
precious stones. Her vesture was purple, and her mantle, lined with white
ermine, was also elegantly furred with the same. The Princess Blanche,
the daughter of the subject of illustration,
appears to have copied closely the dress above described, and, like the
maids of honour of the Lady Triamore herself, she is not only richly
habited but thoroughly well-laced as well. Thus we see, in the year
13 361, the ful influence of the corset on the costume of that period.
There is another poem, said to be more ancient than even Launfal,
which, no doubt, served to give a tone and direction (to the fashicns of
times following after. Here we find a beautiful lady described 1s
wearing a splendid girdle of beaten gold, embellished with mubies
emeralds, about her middle small.
Gower, too, when describing a lover who is in the act of admiring
and B1.
his mistress, thus writes
" He seeth hir shape forthwith, all
Hir bodye round, hir middle small."
