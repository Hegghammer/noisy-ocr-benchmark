When this book was written, the writer was
under the supposition then generally current that
the Armenian Massacres of April, 909, in Cilicia
were instigated by Abd- ul Hamid and his Yildiz
Clique. Babikian Effendi, the Armenian deputy
who went to Adana from Constantinople to in-
vestigate into the massacres, plainly reported that
all investigations had failed to trace them to Abd-ul
Harrid and bis Vildia Clique Rabikian Effendi,
as was to be expected, died suddenly on his return
Z
to Constantinople, but later on it became known
thatth massacres of April, 1909, had been planned,
prepared, organized and carried into execution by
VE
the Constitutional Government of what has been
called " Liberal Turks " or " Turks."
