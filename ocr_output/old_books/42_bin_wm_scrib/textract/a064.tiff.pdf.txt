Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
Turkish rule? To this question, we must answer an emphatic No!
Xing
The causes that must operate against any change are Cany and deep-
seated. In the first place it cannot be expected Turks of liberal
ideas (or it may be French polished) at Constanthrople, are going to change
the thought and character of the nation. The characteristics of a people
ghange very slowly, if they ever change at all, and the predominant national
traits of the many-blooded modern Turk have been shown to the world to
be cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a fierce sensuality and what is
more than all, and which has to be remembered most, that they are a
people accustomed to the unbridled gratification of their worst passions.
The ethnographic traits of the Turkman which history bears out, are
wildness and fierceness, and it would not be incorrect to argue that with the
instincts of his primitive ancestors have be en assimilated the many cross
that run in his veins, into all of which has been infused the
doctrines of the religion of the sword, a religion which does not make for
the peace or well being of mankind; a religion, also, which assigning one/of
the two sexes to the degraded position of being created solely for the gross
pleasure of the other, does not make for the exaltation of mankind.
To quote again the eminent authority previously referred to : No
Mahommedan race or dynasty has ever shown itself able to govern well
even subjects Sacterd rights to subjects of
a different creed is forbidder by the very law of its being.

Not the Jewish conceit proclaiming itself God's elect and chosen, and
originating the name heathen which it scorned. Not the Christian conceit
emanating from the Jewish source, and laying the flattering unction to its
soul of super over the heathen of its own time. Not the unbending
caste exclusiveness of the Brahman across whose path even the shadow of
the despised Sudra falling would be deemed defilement. Not any of these,
can equal the intolerant religious pride of the Mahommedan, or reach
the
pinnacle of religious self-sufficiency on which he has seated hinself. To
a
Mahommedan, is enough-Cell suffit.
To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans,
intimate with Mahommedan thought, one fact nrust strike itself most forcible
AB, and be
and that is, the Mahommedan is above all things Mahommedan. His
religion is the paramount question in his life, d remains its predominating
feature above everything else. This should not be surprising, since to the
" faithful" Paradise is secured, and all crimes and transgressions against
"unbelievers absolved.
