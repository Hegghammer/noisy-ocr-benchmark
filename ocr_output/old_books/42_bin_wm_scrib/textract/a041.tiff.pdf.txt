like a round bow, a great brown eye revealed the inward spirit's intelligence, and zear

quenched. On his head was a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.
Thus, near the end of last December, one of a centur
men-Migrditch
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people-slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or The Only-Begotten
Descended.' From the window of a neighboring room he might have looked across the
frost boand plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now all eut close and huried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling suow and hurricane that hid the
conc of Ararat. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of that lake, eighty-seven years ago, Khrimian was born In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land the Sultan still countedas one ofthe formid-
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Grecce from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom-a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Near East. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos now looked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to last it had been inspired by one absorbing and unselfis aim-the freedom and
his people. It is true he had failed
From his carliest years, when lie had witnesse the terrors of Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality-such
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance among
the
prosperous and contented of the world. He began as a poet, wandering far and wide through
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wife's death, he devoted himself to the building of schools,
which he generously threw open to Kurds the hereditary assassins of Armenians. For many
years, while Europe tras occivied with (imean wars Austrian wars, or Frepeh and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying from an to Constantinople and through the
Z
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emblems of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When elected A patriarch of Constantinople (1869), he was driven from
his office after four years.
But th ecum Tw ish iniquity was filling. The pitiless slaughter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to plead his people's cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great cour of Curope
beforehand, urging them to create an autonomous nentral state for Armienta, As they had
done in Gladstonc the with Congress success was then itself for only the Khrimian the Lebanon. blazing could In firebrand gain London nothing which he became had for kindled his acquainted peuple the beyond heart with of the Gladstone promises and, of B.I
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
emforee Turkey's definite reforms. It is needless to say that unge of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London argid shorts of " Peace with Honor,'
and Armenia was left to stew.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armeniaus were slaughtered like slieep from the Bosporus to Lake
