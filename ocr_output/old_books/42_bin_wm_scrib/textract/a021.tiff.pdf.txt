earth as other nations Does Humanity, does Christianity allow that theating tender
babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and butchered
before the eyes of their mothers, or that the ears of mothers should be rent
with the cries of the dying agony of their murdered children Does
Humanity, does Christianity allow that helpless women should be forcibly
sabjected to the most hideous, the most loathsome, the most revolting, and
the most cruel outrages? Does Humanity, does Christianity, allow all this?
Christian Governments have organized a Hague Conference of Peace
and Civilization, but they have. closed its doors to the cause of a bleeding
christian race groaning under the yoke of the cruellest oppressors that the
world has yet known. Christian men and women have held up their hands
in horror at the Indian Juggernauth ; but alas! the political wheels of
Christian Governments have been a Greater Juggernauth for a helpless
christian race It is by Christian Governments that " we are made as the

commercial interests in the Empire of your oppressors be endangered, can-
not regard you. It may be the deadliest scandal of Christendom that we
Christian Power should be all gathered together, one against another, in the
Empire of your Oppressors, as eagles gather together round a car case; but
really there is no help for it; and if you must die hideously by hellish
extermination, why then you must die, and we have to condone you hekish
extermination, for in any case, each one of us must secure his own political

In Transcaucasia and Ararat," published by Mr James Bryce in 1876,
