have the name for the original of which we seek.
The seaports of Spain furnished the great body
of Spanish adventurers to America in the six-
teenth and seventeenth centuries; and what
more likely than that some native of the little
town crowning with its vine-clad cottages the
huge rock that looks out upon
"midland
ocean," should have sought to honor his home
by fixing its name upon a spot in the new
âœ“ world?
When and by whom the name was affixed to
our shores is an interesting inquiry. Neither
Roberts, nor Fairbanks, nor any other author-
ity, informs us. It comes into history with the
advent of Ariola, whose settlement will be
the subject of a future page.
Three hypotheses furnish as many answers
to the question: it was original with Arriola
to the extent at least of a new application of a
Spanish name; or he found the place already
named in some chart or document now lost to
us; or already fixed by an Indian tradition,
according to Roberts and Fairbanks.
The first hypothesis requires no comment.
The second rests upon the existence of a fact of
