from Smith, who himself was prone to include
the most extravagant myths in his pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE LIVES AND ACTIONS OF THE
HIGHWAYMEN. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the "truth" of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.
No one has ever reprinted those authors in
their original extravagance, or their grossness.
It would be impossible; and, if possible, it would
mn not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
them, or even written an independent history of
the highwaymen. When we consider how astonish-
ingly popular those romances have
ever been
which have had Claude Du Vall, and Turpin,
and their like for heroes, this is notis not 
a little
surprising
Perhaps the task has been abandoned because
of the difficulty-the almost insuperable difficulty
=of sifting fact from fiction, and because of a
chilling sense that it would be a thankless task
to present the highwayman as he really was:
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No novelist would
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dis-
service; and I do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
