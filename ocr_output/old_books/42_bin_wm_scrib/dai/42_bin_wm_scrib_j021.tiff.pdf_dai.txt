cane is covered with strips of mahogany 1/4 in. thick and 1 in. wide
in which a groove ½ in. deep and ¾ in. wide has been run. This
groove may be made with saw, chisel, or combination plane. Fig. 8
shows a sketch of such a strip. It makes a neat pleasing cover.
Many pieces of so-called expensive furniture have ragged, exposed
caning. This is unsightly and is not to be commended.

sary that the frame be stained before caning is begun. Box fuming

stains produce decided colors. If the worker desires to color the
cane approximately the same shade as the article, the caning may
be done on the white wood and the entire article stained at the one
operation. Cane may be shellacked or varnished or left natural, .
