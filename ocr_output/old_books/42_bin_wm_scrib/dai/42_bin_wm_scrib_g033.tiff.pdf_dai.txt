Again, amongst savages, we should expect to
find in the name of a place an indication of a
natural object, the name being expressive of the
object, and hence as lasting. But, that the
accident of an encampment of savages upon a
locality should stamp that locality with their
tribal name, as a designation that should sur-
vive not only the encampment, but the very
existence of the tribe, is incredible. An extinct
tribe would in a generation or two cease to
have a place in the traditions of surviving
tribes, because their extinction would be only
an ordinary event amongst American savages.
The termination being Spanish, and no nat-
ural object existing suggestive of the name, we
naturally turn our search to a vocabulary of
Spanish names,
historical and geographical.
