On the field the ever victorious army of little Japan undermined $
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and evg® drivi cK the ever
defeated and ever retreating army of colossal Ru ‘ tsea the ever
victorious Japanese Ileet succeeded in completely @Anihilating the Russian
P It was war such as the world had never yet seen. The secret of
uéh as)ounding successes should be investigated, and here I beg leave to
quote Arom one of a series of articles in which I gave view to my opinions
wf the Russo-Japanese War. “Japan may be likened to the bundle of
faggots in the fable firmly tied together ; one faggot of larger dimensions in
the centre, the sovereign round whom the whole nation clusters, and all,
ruler and people tied together by adamantine bands of patriotism.”
These remarks of mine were based on observations of actual facts. In
national unity Japan stands as an object lesson to the world; she furnishes
ne-—irekaiffesthich the world needs to copy, and which a nation so politically
forlorn as ourselves more than any other needs to copy.
From the astounding success of Japan let us turn to the position th
Great Republic of the United States of America occupies in the world, and
take the lesson to heart of what Union can accomplish as we contrast their
present position with the position that the handful of puritan pilgrims occupied .
when they first landed on American soil not quite three hundred years ago.
National UsteyNetinfuradttat tidy uticthic hatter which we must
raise up over our national life. National Unity must be engraven on the
tablets of our minds and throb in the pulses of our hearts. There are
mountains of difficulties before us, and if ever we must reach the goal we
can only do so by being bound together like the bundle of faggots in the
fable, witheve=\erktning or loosening of the bands. Then perhaps we
might once more be able to get an independent footing on the historical soil
of our fathers, and perhaps once more rally round our own flag. A Japan-
ese lives for the State, not for himself; we have no State for whjefj to Jive,
but let us live for our communities whilst we keep the hope The
that communities grow into States.
\We have grit and endurance in an unpar ed degree, but D> /
— characteristics will profit us nothing if we are wa fe) unity. .
Let us remember that utterance of the Foukdes“of our faith. In our
loyalty and allegiance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents of a
cataract, but we must remember His warning utterance :—
“What shall it profit a man.” | What shal] it,profita nation. Unity is
A Let us keep our soul and not los€ it.
