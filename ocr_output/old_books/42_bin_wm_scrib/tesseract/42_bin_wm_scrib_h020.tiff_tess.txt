VIII Preface.—Introduction.

than over a half a century; and lastly Jonathan G. Horton, about a

half a century; making in all two hundred and thirteen years at the

death of Jonathan G. Horton, 3 July, 1873. These six generations ny
all living and dying in the old mansion! Could those old walls

echo all the words ever spoken there, and exhspit aney € scenes

ever witnessed there—the book containing su cd would vastly

exceed in volume the size of the old castle. “tt would bring to light

much that is now in darkness, and must forever remain hidden from

the generations of the living.

At the death of Jonathan G. Horton, the old homestead became,
by will, the property of the Rev. Mrs. Williams, of Brooklyn, N. Y.,
who was the adopted daughter of Jonathan G. Horton, he neyer
having had issue, so that on the 3d of July, 1873, the old homestead
went out of the Horton name.

Mrs. Williams proposes to sell it, and if some of the Hortons do

Mmm Noe buy it, it will indicate a lack of decent respect for the old castle,
if not for the Horton name. It should be bought back into the
Horton name, suitably repaired and preserved for the wonder and
admiration of generations of Hortons yet unborn. Jonathan G.
Horton, the short, thick man, and Stuart I. Terry, are the two men
seen in the engraving, in front of the old house.
