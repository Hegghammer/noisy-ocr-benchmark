DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE. ony
Ihave thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from acdoy
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested winess;

“ Weare having a perfectly hideous time here. Thousands hgy@been murdered—25,000
in this provinee they say ; but the number is probably greater, fo® every Christian village
wasgefped out In Adana about 5000 have perished. After Turks and Armenians had
male freacd the Turks came in the night with hose and kerosene. and set fire to what remained
ofthe Armghian quarter, Next day the French and Armenian schools were fired. Nearly eyery-
of in thofArmenian school perished, anybody trying to escape being shot down by thesoldiers.”

#fie Turkish Authorities do nothing except arrest unoffending Armenians, from whon
by torture they extort the most fanciful confessions. Even the wounded are not safe from
their injustice. .A man was being carried in to me yesterday when he was seized and taken
off to gaol. I dare not think what his fate may be.

“For fiends incarnate commend me to the Turks. Nobody is safe from them. They
murder babies in front of their mothers ; they half murder men, and violate the wives while
the husbands are lying there dying in pools of blood.”

meer Anis did nothing, and the soldiers were se than the crowd, for they were .
better armed. One house in our quarter was burned with 115 peopie inside. We counted
the bodies. ‘The soldiers set fire to the door, and as the windows had iron bars, nobody
could get out, Everybody in the house was roasted alive. They were all women and
children and old people.”—Extraet from letter of Mrs. Doughty-Wylie, wife of British Consul

IN THIS HOUSE 115 WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ROASTED ALIVE.

Jlistory repeats itself. In 1895 Turkish soldiers fell upon seventy to eighty young
women and girls in a chureh, where they had fled for refuge, and after hidcously outraging
them, barricaded them in, setting fire to the bynamgsthopanetivra gud derisively shouting
to AW they were being roasted alive, to call upon their Christ to save them now
