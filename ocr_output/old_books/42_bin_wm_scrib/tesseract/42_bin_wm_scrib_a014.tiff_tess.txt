Alexandetta district destroyed with immense loss of life. Hadjim, Kessab and the neigh-
houring villages were burned. ‘The Armenian quarter in Tarsus was ruined and ill-omened
Marash stained again with the blood of thousands of Armenians, Zeitoon was desolated. The
entire population of Kirikon between Aleppo and Alexandretta were massagred jto the last
habe. ‘he mob and the soldiers burned what they could not carry away, % that tle material
