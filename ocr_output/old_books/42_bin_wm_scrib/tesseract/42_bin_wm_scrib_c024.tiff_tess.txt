O The boat came into the full water between the
rocks, and then it sank down, this boat of brass, un-
til its rim touched the water. It remained still as

curly beard, and he had eyes that were like hawks’
eyes. He hid bit-astraight-toat’ ota _ blue
T material covered all over with curious figures,
and in his hand he held a long polished staff
thathad the shape of two serpents twisting to-
gether. He looked at me and I was frightened of
him, and J turned to my father. But my Epe
