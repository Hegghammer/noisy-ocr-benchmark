42 THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.
British Museum bears on it the strange and anomalous figure pr;
in the annexed illustration, Opinions vary sqfpewh; ‘0 whether y|
its origin might not have been Italian, but we segfio reason. for adopting
his view, and consider it as of decidedly home production. It will be
sépn that the shoulder, upper part of the arm, and figure are those of a
yell-formed female, who wears an unmistakable corset, tightly laced, and ,

waists were too often associated with attributes of a rather brimstone

. character, and that an inordinate love of long, trailing garments and
ornaments SP P<HOds AWE betes mat efi Neememes of a sinister
nature. Many of ilie figures to be found on ancient MSS. after this
period show by their contour that the corset was worn beneath the
drapery, and Strutt, whose work was published in 1796, thus writes of
the cesemerettting to dress in the period following shortly after :—* In
the thirteenth century, and probably much prior to that period, a long
and slender waist was considered by our ancestors as a criterion of
elegance in the female form. We ought not, therefore, to Wogderfif it
