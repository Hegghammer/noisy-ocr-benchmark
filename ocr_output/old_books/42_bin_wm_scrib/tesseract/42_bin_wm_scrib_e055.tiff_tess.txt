THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE. 49 i
having only her kirtle upon her back. John Gower, however, wh nr
wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus dygcribes a any ‘of
ladies. They were, says he, “clothed all alike, in ith rich capes
ox_mantles, parti-coloured, white, and blue, embroMered all over with
tus devices.” Their bodies are described as being long and small,
and Jhey had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though each of them

court of the Lady Triamore “had mantles of green-coloured velvet, | :

ermine, was also elegantly furred with the same. The Princess Blanche,

maids of honour of the Lady Triamore herself, she is not only richly
habited but thoroughly well-laced as well. Thus we see, in the year
1361, the fyllinfuence of the corset on the costume of that period.

emeralds, about her middle small. /
— Gower, too, when describing a lover who Si act of admiring -
“His mistress, thus writes:— — -
