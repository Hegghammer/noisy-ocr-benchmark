No one doubts that a great forward movement is reaching its culmina& nr
ing point in the destiny of Asia. The West has learnt its all of refigs he
moral and guiding principle of mankind) from the Edt, © the East
would fain learn the law of restraint and the law of Seéedom (the protecting
pringiples of mankind) from the West. Inspired by this feeling the liberal

To the Mahommedan world at large the Caliph of Islam is the envoy of
God, the sacredness of whose person must be inviolate. Abdul Hamid, the

Christianity has now partly emancipated herself from the ferocities
