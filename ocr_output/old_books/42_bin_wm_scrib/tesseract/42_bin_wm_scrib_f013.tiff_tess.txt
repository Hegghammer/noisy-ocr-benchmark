PREFACE ix
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific his- any
. torians have degraded many of our ancient hey
and exalted the villains, for who old no
mud was too thick and slab. Beliefs are being
, assailed on every side. Yo abolish the traditional
courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the considerate
conduct of Captain MIHind would, therefore, be
strokes of the unkindest, and I have here attempied
no such tconoclasm. Even where I cannot be-
nroncnrcnlws, I have told the tale—whenever it has been
worth the telliny—as it is found in criminal
trials, or in Smith or Johnson, and other old (/-
sources, decorously strinped of much vile language.
For really, where much that seems incredible
my be RUA RDA WA Weg Be Ackepable
turns out not rurely to be false, ’tis your only way.
T Lo continue the story of the highwaymen from
Smith and Johnson down to the approaching end
ofall ouch things in the beginning of the nine-
teenth century, is like taking up and concludin
a half-toid tale. But it was worth the dofng.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpinl his TS /
__ always made, has it been found os necessary .
“—~ to seriously consider and re-stake thé career of
that much-overrated scoundrel, and to put him
in his proper place: a very much lower one
AO he usually oceupit,.\ “—"¥—
