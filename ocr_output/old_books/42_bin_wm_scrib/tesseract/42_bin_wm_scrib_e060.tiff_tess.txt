century very little change appears to have been inade either in costume or
the treatment of the figure, but at the commencement of the fifteenth
century, when such noble families as the Medici, Este, and Visconti
established fashions and styles of costume for themselves, each house

masters of the period, by painting ideal compositions, also gave a marked
tone to the increasing taste for dress. The costume of an Italian duchess,
whose portrait is to be seen in the Academy at Pisa, has been thus

visible, are crimson velvet, and reach to the centre of the hand. They
are cut out at the wrists, and white puffings of the same material as
