CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. ? 2
an opposite theory, in which instinctive agency is rejected, and the appearances are explained from a
a consideration of the necessities and voluntary exertions of the anima]. With regai e
observer, it has been asserted, that it is by experience alone that he distinpAi signs of the
passions ; that we learn, while infants, to consider smiles as expressions indness, because they
are, panied by acts of beneficence and by endearments ; and frowns as the contrary, because
fe followed by blows ; that the expression of anger in a brute, is only that which has
een obserged to precede his biting ; and that of fondness, his fawning and licking of the hand.
ith refard to the creature itself, it is said, what has been called the external signs of passion, are
merely the coucomitants of those voluutary movements, which the passions or habits suggest ; that
‘the glare of the Lion’s eye, for example, is the consequence of 2 voluntary exertion to see his prey
more clearly —his grin, or snarl, the natural motion of uncasing his fangs before he uses them.
This, however, is not quite true of all animals and of all expression of passion.”
“Attending merely to the evidence furnished by anatomical investigation, all that I shall
ro Oren terion is this: that a remarkable difference is to be found between the anatomy and
range of expression, in man and in animals: that in the former there seems to be a systematic
provision for that mode of communication and that natural Iauguage, which is to be read in the
changes of the countenance: that there is no emotion in the mind of man which has not its
appropriate signs ; and that there are even muscles in the Luman face to which uo other use can be
assigned than to serve as the organs of this language: that, on the other hand, there is in the lower
animals no range of expression which is not fairly referable as a mere accessary to the voluntary
or needful actions of the animal ; and that this aceessary expression does not appear to be in any
degree commensurate dk Sr a I Ne aN te
“There appears to me (continues Mx. BELL) to be no expression in the face of any animal
lower in the scale of being than quadrupeds; and in them the strongest and most marked
expression is that of rage; the ohject of which is opposition, resistance, and defence. But on
examination it will be foun Jconsistently with the position, that this is merely an accessary of
the motions nafural to the accomplishment of the object which the animal has in view) that the
strength of the expression is in exact proportion to the strength of the principal action in the
creature when thus excited.
“The gramniyorous animals, which seek their subsistence, not by preying upon othersfhoy by
the ferocity, contest, and victory which supply the carnivorous with food, have in their fofturgs no,
strong expression of rage. Their expression is chiefly confined indeed to the effect produted fe /

with the horns turned obliquely to the ground, ready to strike: ant in it may be observed
in general that animals which strike with the horns, shew little indication of fear or rage, except in
