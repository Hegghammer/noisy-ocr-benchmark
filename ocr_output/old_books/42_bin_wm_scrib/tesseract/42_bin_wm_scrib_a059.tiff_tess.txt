OUT OF THE 0 pe

“Qh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that
WNuighf weep day and night for the slain of my people.”

A book has been written and published in Japan, its title “ Niku Dan”
translated into English, reads, “Human Bullets.” This little book, a
narrative of the siege of Port Arthur, after being read through the length
and kreadty of the empire, found translators to translate it into the best
Known of languages ; and its young author, himself an actor in the siege,
was summoned to the presence of his sovereign to be thanked and praised.
The book is a graphic narrative of the most terrible siege in history, wherein
is vividly portrayed the deadly struggle of the besiegers. It contains as an
acknowledgement of its merit, a page on which is recorded the Vield
Marshal's appreciation, and another page bearing the Commanding General’s -
commendation.

In simple nartefteertreumnormrhies un aeederubrough appalling
scenes of horror, and as we read we are made to realize the slaughter of
the enemy’s machine guns, of their ground-mines, electric-wire entangle-
ments, and exploding shells ; we are made to hear the roar of the artillery
fire dealing death and destruction, and there rises before us the mental vision
of the fiercesaem! +tetmind conflict, and the dead and dying lying thickly in
the dark ravine. .

“ For hill and battle plain,

With dying men and slain,

Grew mountain heights of pain,

And mine is boundless woe.” /

‘The erim warrior who stormed and took the impregnable fortress

—— _in+heavorld gives expression to his feelings on hif dwn Jereat achievement, .
in saddest words.
“And mine is boundless woe,”

For the grim warrior's heart is cleft in twain for the human bullets that
under his command hurled themselves to their death.
