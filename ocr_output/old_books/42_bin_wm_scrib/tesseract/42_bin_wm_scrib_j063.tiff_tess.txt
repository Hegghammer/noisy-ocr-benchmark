REED AND SPLINT WEAVING 59
mable, and should be used in a room in which there is free circula-
tion of air. If colors have been mixed properly and thinned to the ony
right consistency, the reed will dry rapidly and the color Jwil
sharp and clear, free from muddy effects.
A woven article such as a basket or woven ‘ootstool may be
‘pped, or the color poured over and allowed to drip dry. In some
nst¥nces it is good policy to wipe surplus stain off lightly. ‘Then,
in fhe case of the footstool or similar project, if the worker so
esires he may stain the wood a darker shade than the top with a
prepared stain. Reed is very effective without stain; many of the
stools shown herewith are left natural. Reed may be shellacked or
varnished. Because of its porosity it soils very easily unless some
nour rrAsagazgent is used, and a good grade of elastic varnish is recom-
mended as a finish, especially when the woven article is subject to
severe use. (/-
Other Materials.—Reed is not the only good medium adapted
| to weaving, either in correlation with wood or when used alone.
On the stools iflustrated several other materials have been used,

Sufficiestto-say that this fiber adapts itself admirably to almost
all work where reed is commonly employed, and in many instances
is, commercially, supplanting reed.

the sap is up and the bark slips easily, a hfekeTy tree may be cut
down, and the rough outer bark shaved with a draw knife from
the top of the log the full length of the trunk, leaving a surface
from 8 in. to 10 in. wide. WH dre tiife spit the inner bark
