THE LUSITANIA’S LAST VOYAGE
Friday noon (May 7) we made only 462 miles. AAG
This was partly accounted for by the fact,th
we picked up Greenwich time CE See
and put the clock ahead 1 hour and 40
O minutes.
The reason this small run impressed itself
upon my mind was that I expected that
when we sighted the Irish Coast the “Lucy”
mur would show a burst of “top speed” and that
we should go flying up at not less than 25 (/-
miles an hour. The run up to Thursday noon
| (May 6) had been 484 miles, and so confident
was J that, she would put gn, steam that I
bought the high number in the pool (for
T Friday), which was 499. It was the only pool
J_went-into and I couldn’t help it, for the
number sold at £3.0.0 and at that price it
looked like a “‘bargain.”
