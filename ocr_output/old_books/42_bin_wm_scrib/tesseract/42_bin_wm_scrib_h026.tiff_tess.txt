XIV Preface.—Introduction,

This book is mainly what those who have kindly furnished records
and sketches have made it. The whole has been carefully compiled.
But genealogical works, almost of necessity, contain many error: nr
Doubtless this small work has its fullshare. But when errors -
covered, notice thereof should be given, so th9t a s. ition may
be made entirely truthful. Thankful to all w ave generously given
their assistance, this work is sent out as a shall contribution to the
genealogical literature of the day, and in the hope that a more full
and extensive book of Horton chronicles may be issued at no very
distant day.

Terrytown, ro Jan., 1876.
