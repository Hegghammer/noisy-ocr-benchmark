PREFACE
© _
Tue subject which we have here treated is a sort of figurative
battle-field, where fierce contests have for ages been from time to time
waged; and, notwithstanding the determined assaults of the attacking
hosts, the contention and its cause remain pretty much as they were at the
ent of the war. We in the matter remain strictly neutral,
. merely performing the part of the public’s “ own correspondent,” makin,
it our duty to gather together such extracts from despatches, both ancien
and modern, as may prove interesting or important, to take note of the
vicissitudes of war, mark its various phases, and, in fine, to do our best
to lay clearly efore our readers the historical facts-sexperiences and
arguments—relating to the much-discussed “ Corset question.”
T As most of our readers are aware, the leading journals especially
intended for the perusal of ladies have been for many years the media
for the@Xthinge of a vast number of letters and papers touching
the use of the Corset. The questions relating to the history of
this apparently indispensable article of ladies’ attire, its cgyfS}rucpion,
application, and influence on the figure have become so anf ]
that we have thought, by embodying all that an glean aitd gamer /
—_ —telating to Corsets, their wearers, and the (9 costumes worn by .
ladies at different periods, arranging the sub) atter in its due order
as to dates, and at the same time availing ourselves of careful illustration | f~
when needed, that an interesting volume would result.
