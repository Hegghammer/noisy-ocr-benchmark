“Cyf you imagine the feelings of the Kessab people as they climbed on foot the lung trail

ruined dwellings? ‘Their stores of wheat, barley and rice had been burned ; clothing, cooking
utensils, furniture and tools had gone ; their goats, cows and mules liad been stolen ; their silk
industries stamped out ; their beloved churches reduced to smouldering heaps. The bodies of
their friends and relatives who had been killed had not been buried, And yet the love of
home is so strong that the people have settled down there with the determination to clear up
the debris and rebuild their houses.” —Extraets from ‘“ The Sack of Kessab,” Stephen Van R.

As these sheets are going through the press there comes news of famin
at Zeitoon. The Rev. F. W. Macullum, American Missionary at Marash|
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet, American Missionary at Constantinople, that
12,000 souls in and around Zeitoon are dying of hunger ; they are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran and water, and cooking and eating it, if they can
get even that. Rev. Macullum adds, ‘The same story comes to us from all
sides. As we foseemcall-dhuathoww0werthentichcssumlbe greatest.”

If 50,000 were massacred, the list of those who have died and are dying
of homelessness and starvation will exceed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exageerated. Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.

The IaTS8t news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered in a night attack
by armed Kurds, and the villagers are now reduced to extreme distress, Before
the outbreals the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeated f yppqiled
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armeni atylarc
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking prqtec-
tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack apprehended. It is

— eyident that the authorities at Constantinople are/ufabl} to protect thriving -
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
