Remember that they know not what eer
o strike in deadly fear and ghastly hate;
emember that somehow, and at some time,

Each crime exacts its human penalty.
Remember that man’s conscience and man’s mind
Are agents of Thy purpose and Thy pian,

nonu_ Sbich work within a deadlier revenge
Than any shrapnel shot or sabre thrust. (/-
Remember that new generations come
Upon whom fall the burden and the curse,
The anguish of old hatreds and past wrongs,
The crushing Gebt, the struggle and despair.

T Restrain, O God, the sweep of this vast hate;
Recall the nations to their sense of shame:
To those in blinding war, to us at peace,
Reveal anew the message of the Christ.
