‘Church, but was also a fearless patriot—a distinguished linguist, an eloquent preacher, and, ony
thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded betyeen ‘Tu
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it pva Aho, in
spite of the feared fanatieal uprising of the Turks, threw pradfjleg, t eNMnds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian hey,

Atthe first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delédates were thuuderstruck to

Tey rom official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinople, sent
fy Wonsgneur Nereés, the Patriarch, their object heing to request the signatory Powers of
he Berlif Treaty to foree a guarantee from the Turkish Government fo make certain
nporty#t improvements in Armenia.

Abdul Hamid and his advisers were furious at this aftront, and Monseigneur Nereés was
summoned to the Palace. It is said that when he received the summons he simply smiled
and asked one of of his curates to read the Burinl Service to him, as he did not expect to
return alive. However, he went. No one has ever heard what passe between the Sultan
and himself at the interview ; suffice it to say that he immediately summoned the Armenian
General Assembly and tendered his resignation. This was not accepted by the Assembly,
and, amidst enthusiastic cheers, he was carried hack to his apartments at the Patriarchate.

ANAM HO Poremptory order reached him, signed hy the Sultan, to reeall the Armenian
delegation from Berlin. This Monseignear Varjabétian point-blank refased to do, and retived
to his private residence at Haskeuy, 1 village on the Golden Horn. ‘The success of the dele-
gation, however, did not come up to his expectations. The Armenians, as it happened, could
not be heard, but they were so far successful as to have an article inserted in the treaty.

The Sultan and his advisers never forgaye the Patriarch this, though they could not
openly do anything to him on account of his enormous popularity. ‘Time passed on, and to
all appearance the incident was forgotten, but it was not so. One summer afternoon a most
cordial invitation was sent by a very high dignitary of the Palace, requesting the Arehbishop
to dine with him infoprmehwanbnutetsuins taco be refused, so
the Archbishop, accompanied only by a body-servant named Vartan, repaired to the Pasha’s
house. The Pasha received him at the door aud escorted the visitor with much ceremony and
extreme courtesy to a private apartment of the salamlik of his house (the men’s quarters),
where dimmer was served. The geniulity displayed hy his host dispelled any fears that the
Archbishop might have had as to his personal safety.

After dijacienseneret, collec was served. Now, this serving of the coffee is rather a
ceremonial acedrding to high Turkish etiquette, and it is not unusal for guests to bring their
own (chooboukdas (the servyant who carries his master’s pipe and pouch and also superintends
the making of his ecoftee). The Archbishop was presented with a “ tchoobouk ” (pipe) filled
and lighted for smoking, and a servant followed with coflve. The Archbishop ag@@pted Jhoth
with due compliments to his host, and took a sip at his coffee. Just at thaWmgmey the
lieayy curtains over the doorway were thrown apart, revealing the ghastly ple face Af
servant Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, in a voice trembling with emotion, f MpngAgéur,

— This was enough for the Archbishop ; he pretended to hoftgfTey and spilt the eoflee, but, -
alse had already drunk a small quantity of it. Meanwifile a sogtille was goiug on behind
the portitre, where his poor servant Vartan was paying thd peyaity of his devotion to his
master. Concerning Vartan’s whereabouts or his ultimate end nothing was ever made public
—the poor fellow simply vanished. Monseigneur Vayjabétian, after a short interval thanked
the Pusha for his generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily sammoned. The Patriarch took to his hed,
and lost all his hair through the effects of He Paon—Phoryuertwworning, when a servant
