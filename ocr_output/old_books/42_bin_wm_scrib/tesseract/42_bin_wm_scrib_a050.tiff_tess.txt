been placed by the Great Founder of his faitl TSseventeen hundred
years unremittingly since Christianity was revive{ in Armenia by Gregory
Fe Illuminator, the Christian law with regard to the position of woman has
Molded the thought of the nation, it has left its impress on the nation, and
it ig this vital and essential difference between the law of Mahommed and the

toward which, bleeding and torn, we have been striving, and still are striving?
These are questions which we must ask ourselves ; looking them soberly in
