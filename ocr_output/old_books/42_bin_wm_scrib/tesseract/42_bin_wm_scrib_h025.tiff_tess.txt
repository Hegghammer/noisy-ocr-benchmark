The feader Will see at a glance the plan of this book. We com-
mence with the Christian name, Then follows the parentage, genea-
logical data, &c,, and then the Christian names of the children and
order of births. In many of the early families the exact order
births cannot be ascertained; but it has been approximated as negrly TS
as possible. The lineage is given in connection with the first member /
—__ of the family. The Roman numerals indicate O of births. .
“Phe sons and daughters of the old Puritan, Barnfhas, cgnstitute the
second generation, but they are spoken by way of ehwénce as Joseph
I., Hannah I., &c. The book contains much repetition, but none
too much to make it plain and easy to study.
This little book contains the chrppisles of oply about one-half of
the Horton families looked up. Those whose genealogical data are
gi only in a small part, and those whose correct lineage has not
en satisfactorily ascertained, are not included in this book.
