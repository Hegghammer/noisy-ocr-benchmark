6 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

and carnivorous habits. They walk on their toes: yet not so much from that habitual stea may
of pace, by which they advance unpereeived till within a spring of their prey ; as is also

the means of that celerity of motion which is necessary to thOvery exi of animals that can

fleed only on flesh.

Their claws are exceedingly powerful; and they are enibled to draw them up into sheaths
between their toes, so as to prevent their points from touching the ground; whence they are
called retractile ; and those claws are, in consequence, always kept sharp, unworn, and ready for
active service.

The eyes of the Feline tribe—of every face in nature a striking and important feature—vary
in the different species, and are capable of much alteration in the same animal; as instinctive
impulse, or internal emotion, changes the expression of his countenance; and also from the
degrees of light which act upon their pupils. Of Lions the pupils of the eyes are circular, and
not of a yellow colour, as has becn stated in the most difluse modern dissertations on the
Carnivora, but black. It is the iris of the Lion’s eye that is yellow. They appear to be best

is above the horizon—perbaps never, but when pressed by hanger in an extraordinary degree
The Tiger, on the contrary, will seek his prey by day as well as by night; and during twilight t}fe
colour of his eyes is that of a blue-green flane. Ifa stranger passes near a Tiger in a menakefie,
the colour of the animal’s eyes will sonietimes alter suddenly, from yellow-green to blue-green ;
not from any alteration in the degree of light acting’ upon them, but from mental excitement, and
from a certain natural facility of expansion and contraction of the eye-pupils.

are diurnal, and he disregards night-fires: the Lion, on the contrary, whose eyes are not calculated
for the glare of day, cannot bear to encounter fire-light at night. Yet these physical conforma-
tions are sometimes overcome by the rage of hunger; and hence, in Mr. Epwin Lanpsten’s
contending group, the Lion is represented as attacking the ‘Tiger although it be day.

this class of quadrupeds, in his “ Anatomy of Expression.”—We shall offer a few extracts, by
which the reader will perceive how limited are their powers of expression of countenance, when
compared with those of human nature, notwithstanding their superiority over ther Quadrupeds,
