The Persians entertain much the same ny ith regard to the
necessity for slenderness of form in the belles oF their nation, but differ in
ther matters from the Hindoos. ‘The following illustration represents a
ancing-girl of Persia, and it will be seen that her figure bears no
indication of neglect of cultivation. It is somewhat curious that the
Chinese, with all their extraordinary ingenuity, have confined their
restrictive efforts to the feet of the ladies, leaving their waists unconfined.
That their doing so is more the result of long-established custom than
absence of admiration for elegantly-proportioned figures will be clearly
by the following extract from a letter published in Chambers
Yournal, written by a genuine inhabitant of the Celestial Empire,
named Woo-tan-zhin, who paid a yisit to England in 1844-45. This
he describes the ladies of England :— |

charming beyond description, and their waists are laced as tight and thin
as a willowAxageb_ tbat paleps,caugb my fapey_ most was the

By many writers it has been urged that the admiration so generally

taste set up by long custom; but in Woo-tan-zhin’s és} it} was
clearly not so, as the small-waisted young ladies off the fou
