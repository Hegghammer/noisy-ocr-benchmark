2 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. ony
the scene of which, by the way, he has not represented as a royal menagerie, but ild,
rocky cavern—his animals partake of the artificial character which we ring ourselves to

. approve.

Of this fact, however, we purpose to exhibit proof witfqur assertion. Improved versions, to
the best abilities of our Artists, of some of these Lions of Rubens and the Assyrian king, will here

O be introduced, which the reader, who pleases, may compare with the originals. Our second, third,
and fourth Plates are of the number.

The Lions of Rubens are humanized. We do not intend to discuss at length whether the
ideality of allegorical painting required this: we only state the fact: yet the opinions which we
felt at liberty to form on the subject, we feel at liberty to utter. So much in apology for using the
licence of asserting that the heads of many of the Lions of Rusnns rather resemble those of frowning
old gentlemen decorated with Ramillies wigs ; as if Nature’s journeymen had made manes, and not
made them well. There is a profusion of flowing and curling hair, which seems rather to solicit

PW orMetinguents of the perfumer, than to have endured the torrid heats of the desert, or the rough
storms of the forest. he shag of a Lion’s mane is a very different sort of thing.

However such dressed Lions may be thought to accord with Allegory, they are demonstfab},
at variance with Nature. To be sure, what might become a Lion in the procession of the CarYlial
Virtues, might be rather unsuitable in lis den, or within the precincts of those wild haunts, wher he
js accustomed to roam in his uatura] state. We have often read of the fabled Men-bulls, or (Mino-
taurs,) and we find such on the coinage of Crete. ‘These allegorical creatures of Runxns, which,
alas! have Sop times been Brion by. Artists phon half bg geujus,and placed in savage con-
flicts, or beside their Britaunias—are a species of Men-lions. Placed among the Sabean sculp-
tures, they might pass for incarnations of Sol in Leo; but would very ill pass for Leo alone.

Among the cbservers of this poetic improvement, or this natural and unpoetical deficiency, on
the part of Rubens, Prrian, JuLio Romano, and other painters, both ancient and modern; and
of the consguusit desideratum on the part of the public, of a cabinet or library collection of the
nobler wild animals in a state of Nature, so as to answer the purposes of reference, while they con-
duced to the pleasures of Taste, were Mr. Ep¢ar Sprtspury and Mr. Tuomas LanpsEer.
Whether or not the public “looked up to them for light” ou that subject, (to ugasthe lynguage of
Stunyn,) they thought the Public “deserved it;” and they therefore, as the Sestfpracfical means
of eliciting that light, first copied the general forms and attitudes of most offthe frild Anny at,
appear in this book, from the old masters—generally speaking, from works thalsfe well knoyfh /
—and then, went to Nature and corrected the detail carried with them what, in tose

— —— ancient masters, was meritorious in composition, attifidé andJchiaroscuro, and brought away, °
{o the best of their ability—superadding it to, and of it with, the above—accuracy of
detail.
