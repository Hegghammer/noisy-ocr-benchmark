THE HORSES OF KING MANUS
Or. for the youth who had tried to steal the white
horse that the King owned, he was bound hand
and foot and taken into the castle of the King.
There he was thrown down beside the trestles of
n-~mnthe great table, and the hot wax from the candles
that lighted the supper board dripped down upon
him. And it was told to him that at the morrow’s (/-
| sunrise he would be slain with the sword.
Then the King called upon one to finish the
story thoy was hemng told when the neigh of
T the white horse was heard in the stable. The
story could not be finished for him, however,
because the one who had been telling it was now
outside, guarding the iron door of the stable wit
a sword in his hand. And King Manus, An)
at the supper board, could not eat nor re TS /
—_— —himself because there was no cne(eCpn to finish -
the story for him.
