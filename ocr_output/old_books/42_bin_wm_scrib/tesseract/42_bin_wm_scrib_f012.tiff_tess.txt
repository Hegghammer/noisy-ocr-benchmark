viii PREFACE
from Sinith, who himself was prone to include
* the most extravagant myths in his pages, calls any
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE History<
THE Lives AND ACTIONS OF THE 'AMOUS
HieuwayMen. Both of them inclitde pirates and
murderers. Of the “truth” of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better. j
No one has ever reprinted those authors in
their original extravagance, or their grossness.
It would be impossible ; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
them, or even written an independent listory of
the highwaymen. When we consider how astonish- (/-
ingly popular those romances have ever been
| which have had Cloude Du Vall, and Turpin,
and their likg for herogs, this is. not a_ little
surprising.
T Perhaps the task has been abandoned because
of the difficulty—ihe almost insuperable difficulty
=F Tfting fact from jiction, and because of a
chilling sense that it would be a thankless task
to present the highwayman as he really wasf Ja
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthe 0
cruel, and often cowardly. No-Gavelist would /
— — _ be likely to thank the frank senor this dis- .
service ; and I do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgerg_wauldbe-widely read.
