THE OLD BIBLE.

Perhaps the most interesting relic left by our good old ancestor,

Barnabas, is the oLp Bins, which he brought with him from England. ny
It is now in the possession of the Hon. Silas Horton, of Southald.
It was taken to the Bible House, New York, some yegms ago, ap etr€-

We find in it the following record:

«Imprinted at London, by the Deputies of Christian Barker.”

“Barnabas Horton, to his son Jonathan Horton, this BinLE he did bequeath, in

. Capt. Jonathan Horton, his Book. God give him grace. Jonathan Horton, 1683.”

In another place, and probably in the handwriting of Jonathan
Horton, Jr., we find:

“Lydia Tuthill, her Boo?, given her by her mother, as it is said.”
