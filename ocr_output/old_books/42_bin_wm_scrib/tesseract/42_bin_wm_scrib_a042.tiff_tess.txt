the Russian officials played with the revenues, retaining eighty per cent. fo their own
advantage. But in the mean time assassination had rid the earth of Plehye, and the over-
whelining defeats of Russia in Manchuria were attributed to the \rmenian curse. Grudgingly
the Church property was restored, in utter chacs, and for the moment it is Kussia’s policy to
favor the Armenians a3 a balance against the Georgians, whom the St. Petersburg government
is now determined to destroy.

ANN Methe past upon which the worn old miu, stretched on his monastic bed, looked
back that winter’s morning. Singleness of aim has its veward in spiritual peace, but of the
future he was not hopeful. Ile no Jonger even contemplated an autonomous Armenia, eithpr
on 'furkish territory or on Russian. On the Russian side of the frontier the Armenian
villages were tuo scattered, too much interspersed with Georgians and Tartars, to alloly
of autonomy. On the Turkish side, he thought, massacre and exile had now left too few o'
the race to form any kind of community, Indeed, for the last twelve years the Armenian
villagers have been crawling over the fuot of Avarat by thousands a year to escape the Kurds,

‘Tiflis, Baku, or their Caucasian villages, but nowhere are they welcomed.

Some of the bishops and monks, who form a council round their chief, still look for
Europe’s interference, and trust that the solemn pledges taken by England and other Powers
at Berlin myyube fabled. ‘Cho Bishop of Erivan, for instance, still labors for the appoint-
ment of a Cliristian governor over the district marked by the ill-omened names of Van, Bitlis,
and Erzeroum. I also found that even among the Georgians there was a large party willing
to concede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian villages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Cancasuins Federal

“fre Flag,” or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at yfresent flominant, and at a great
assembly held in Erivan last August (1906) they adopted a\progy#fnme of land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected laymen. If the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.

Whatever may be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held togeter-hydangenge-mad religion. Except the Jew:
