Thus, near the end of last December, one of a centufy’sgaxtQtst- men—Maerditeh
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of X4@ Armenian people—slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called KtchnMatzin, or “ The Ouly-Begotten
ipDescended.” From the window of a neighboring room he might have looked. across the

1 hoynd plain of the Araxes, where the vines were vow all cut close and huricd for the
winter. J Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling snow and hurricane that hid the
cone WaArarat. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
y of that Inke, eighty-seven years ago, Khyimian was born,In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land; the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byron sct out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom—a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Near Mast. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos now looked back, buf not unhappy, for
from first to last it had been inspired by onc absorbing and unselfish aim—the freedom and

rcVrrrerrpromobhis people. It is trac he had failed.

From his earliest years, when he had witnessed the terrors of ‘Curkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality—such a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance among tlle
prosperous and contented of the world. He began as poet, wandering far and wide through
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jerusalem)
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wife’s death, he devoted himself to the building of schouls,
which he generously threw open to Kurds, the hereditary assassins of Armenians. For many
years, while Europe sis ccepRion SLA aA arp daelripy us, keKrgpch and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly jonrneying from “Vin to~Constantinople-and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emblems of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenian patriarch of Constantinople (1869), he was driven from
his oflice after four years.

But th ecu lebesish iniquity was filling. The pitiless slaughter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to plead his people’s cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great coy9ot Purope

and Armenia was left to stew.

So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year Dy pico tp wes ipcrgsess tt) by the last incaleulabl
