WHY AND anager

( In Yavin a study of my race, I have found three marked characteristics
InteHiGence—Energy—Industry. Combined with these three characteristics
is an intense Love of Nationality. We live in a complex world. In an
independent people these characteristics and this sentiment are laudable
Virtues. In a subject people they are Crimes.

After [had laid this bitter Truth to heart, I did not have to seek for the

PNT therefore of the Armenian Massacres.

The Armenian Massacres stand without their parallel in history. The
human mind staggers to contemplate the fiendish orgies of which they have
been the victims, and no pen can describe their horrors: and this helpless
christian people are to-day in the same deadly peril as they have been since

Empire have reached their culminating point. Hitherto the Powers of
Lurope have by their jealousies and rivalries cultivated these evil inflpences,
they have watered them and made them grow, but when their gfnfnayng
point is reached, they must re-act on Christendom and the /nafur

1 will allow that Liberty, Justice, Equality, Fratkrnity/are the watchwords
of Young Turkey, but Young Turkey is only a small minority ; the great
majority of the Turkish nation are not Young Turks.

The question therefore resolves itself into this critical point: “What will
va even now?”
