O DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.
‘tat there has hitherto existed no good book of Engravings of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the progress of the student in that department of Art, is to he regretied. The talents
of Mr. Joun Scorr, brought into action by those of Girry, Coorsr, and the Retacuzs,
have presented the public with excellent representations of the distinguished ornanients of the
turf: the sports of the field, and the habits and manners of the canine race, were also duly
eC erred Ret the ferocious TiGER tribe, and the lordly Lroy, we have nothing: extant that
would bear critical inspection, beyond a few detached prints:—nothing like a collection of
figures, whose justuess and accuracy of form, action, character, and expression, might be (/-
relied on. .
Does any reader imagine that the various Etchings which haye been performed—chiefly
abroad—by Artists of no mean ability, may be considered as exceptions? They are not exceptions:
or at best, the number which might be so regarded is but small, aud those, for the most part, of
dimensions not accommodated to the drawer of the eabinet, ov the shelf of the library.

perhaps painted a greater number than any other of the old masters) are far more deficient in
form, character, and expression, than is generally supposed, or than will be easily believed, by
those who hav@not sTrually compared them with the Lions, Leopards, and Tigers of Nature.
They have been taken too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
—Nor is this intended to impugn the merits, as historical or poetical painters, of those distinguished
Artists, but sinply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that as a painter of allegory, Rényns
might consider that strong infusion of iwman form, character, and expression, by which is Lins,
for example, are distinguished, as necessary, or conducive, to his allegorical purposes ; orf it i /
sible that his knowledge of this animal may not have been thoroughly f@l-grounded, and that he

Painter, and may not have seen Lions as they really are. This is w' ‘riter is most inclined
to believe, (though not to insist) ; for even in treating the subject of Daniel in the den of Lions—
