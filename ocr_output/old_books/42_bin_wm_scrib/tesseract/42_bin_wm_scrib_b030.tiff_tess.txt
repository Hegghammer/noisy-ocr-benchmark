8 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. ny

the skull, and capable only of very limited motion: the eye i¢plmost uni fy"mild, and the lips
unmoved by passion.
« It is in carnivorous animals, with whose habits and n&nner of life, ferocity is instinctively
O comecttd, as the great means of their subsistence, that rage is distinguished by the most
remarkable strength of expression. The eye-ball is terrible, and the retraction of the flesh of the
lips indicates the most savage fury. But the first, is merely the exerted attention of the animal ;
and the other a preparatory exposure of the canine teeth. The great animals of prey—the Lion
and the Tiger—are quite ineapable of any other expression of feature, than this particular display
of ferociousness. When they fawn upon their keeper, there is no motion in their features that .

In this assertion, that the countenances of the great animals of prey are incapable of any
other than ferocious expression, we do not quite coincide with our learned physiologist. When
PN fw upon their keeper, we think that indications of affection are exhibited; and find
ourselves ready to ask what else than kindly expression is that “licking of the hand” which ouy
author has before mentioned. If, however, we should grant ihat they may not be capaple Af
affectionate expression toward their keeper, we can scarcely doubt that—toward their younk/if
we could observe them in their wild state, and in their moments of playful intercourse and
enjoyment among each other—they are: at least, we think there are motions in their features that
indicate affection, as well as fear, enquiry, surprise, gratitude, pleasurable wantonness, and some

range of their ferocions expression far exceeds the savage circle of their domestic charities. Are
not even the least of these observable in the habits and manners of the domestic Cat, who belongs
to the Tiger genera? But we haye even seen a Tiger in his den, who looked good-natured enough
to be stroked and patted: and of the Lion, of whom Mr, Grrrriri relates the following anecdote,

“Tlearing some noise under his eage, the Lion passed his paw between the bars, and actually
