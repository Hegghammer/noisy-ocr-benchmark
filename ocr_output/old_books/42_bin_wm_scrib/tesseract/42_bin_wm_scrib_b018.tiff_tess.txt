Two Covcuanr Lions, arrer RuBens, taken from celebrat Wire before alluded
. to, of the Prophet Daniel incarcerated in the den. The Lio ereSupposed to be miraculously
held in a state of tranquillity. - Here, too, is not much Expression, but an extraordinary grandeur
of Character, suited to the greatness of an occasion where the Deity himself especially interferes
O to seal up the voracious energies of the most terrible of his creatures, in calm submission. There
is a character of royal dignity mingled with this submission, which is very impressive, and even
sublime.
The writer esteems this to be a successful restoration of the Nature that was wanting in the
prints of this subject, (which has often been engraved by Picaxr and others,) after RuBENs. The
original picture it has been our ill-fortune never to have secu. ‘The shaggy manes, and the latent
terror that sits gloomily enthroned in the open eyes of the superior Lion—suited to the darkness of
the den, and the nature of this animal’s sense of vision,—are as well thought of, as they are
POO ete ; and are varied with much address from the closed eyes of tle couching Lion beyond,
of which also the character is most happily marked. A powerful and divine spell possesses
them both. 7

nerves, has an appalling effect.—His brow is clouded, though his claws are sheathed. There is a
possibility of a dreadful storm which may not be far distant, and that is enough to stamp the
Tiger’s character. None shall dare to arouse his energies, nor to eucounter them when aroused.
