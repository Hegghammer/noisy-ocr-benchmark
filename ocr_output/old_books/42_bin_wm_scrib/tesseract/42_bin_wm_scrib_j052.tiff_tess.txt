Uniform tension on the strand is desirable and this should be tight.
As the work progresses the interior between the upper and lower
rows of strands is stuffed. ‘This is done with the same mg}ial Jas
that used in the weaving. The butt ends of rush are usfd fo sfu
the seat of rush; raffia is used to stuff a raffigeseat; craft paper ‘to /
— __stuff a fiber seat; and soon. The packing (ry done in a thoro :
manner, for it builds up the seat and prevekts it# breaking down at
the inner edges of the rails, and sagging with continued use. A
slightly curved hardwood stick about 12 in. long may be used to
