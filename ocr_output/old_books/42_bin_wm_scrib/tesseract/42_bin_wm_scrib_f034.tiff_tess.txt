entrusted to her keeping by a farmer attending
the market. To convince Ratsey how trusted =
a person she was, she foolishly showed where she nr
had placed the bag; and as soon as her ba s
turned he had taken it from the cupboard where
it lay, and made off.
When the farmer returned and wanted his
money, there was the very deuce to pay. He and
the landlady went off to the nearest justice and
swore an information against Gamaliel, who was
arrested and thrown into prison, but not before he
had found time to return home and bury the bag

where it was hid, his mother told his sister, his
sister told her husband, her husband told his (/-
friends, and so at last the confession reached the

have been hanged on that occasion, only he broke

His further adventures with Snell and
Shorthose, two companions of like inclination,
are in themselves amusing when reduced to less

enough, one of these incidents is concerned with
the robbing of an actor, whom Ratsey bids deljgr
