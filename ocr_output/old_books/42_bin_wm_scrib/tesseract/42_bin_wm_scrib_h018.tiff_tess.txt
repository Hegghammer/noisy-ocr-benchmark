VI Preface.—Tntroduction.
It is said that Barnabas Horton I. was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities.
His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about 2
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. ‘The ston,
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan ton.
It is elevated about eighteen inches from the g' 4@h a good stone
base. ‘The original base was of brick, but itd all crumbled down
many years ago. The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Horton.
The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads as
follows:
“Here lieth buried the body of Mr. BARNABAS Horton, who was born at
Mousely, Leicestershire, Old England, and died at Southold, on the 13th day of
July, 1680, aged 80 years.”
OOO nn the centre of the stone we find the Epitaph, as follows:
« Here lies my body tombed in dust (/-
°Till Christ shall come to raise it with the just; .
My soul ascended to the throne of Ged,
| Where with sweet Jesus now I make abode:
Then hasten after me, my dearest wife,
To be partaker of this blessed life ;
Hear and obey His public sacred word ;
And in your houses call upon His name,
T For oft [ have advised you to the same:
Then God will bless you with your children all,
_—_a And to this blessed place He will you call.”
Heb. xi : 4,—‘* He being dead, yet speaketh.”
It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and tfat/it, fo-
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted, Avasf al
upon the stone before he died. He was the galy one of the wfiginal /
—_ thirteen who brought his tombstone with CO this fact seems to -
— indicate a commendable desire to see that his/name and memory
should not perish from the earth.
