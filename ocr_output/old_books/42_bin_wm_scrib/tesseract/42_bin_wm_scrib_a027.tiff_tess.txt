was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples which with sincere and deep feebialy nr
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armenian. It is the Arfheptys“vho

Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the mins who engage in
eommerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruit&{hess, increase the value of
the man Empire. Because a few among them justly started an agitation, these our noble
ay 5 trions brethren were being massacred. What a terrible scene! \Vhen we
ftAhe school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our Armenian compatriots being
removed jh manure carts ; legs and arms were hanging down outside. ‘This bloody scene will
cer rgafain impressed on my mind. ,

“This shocking crime of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a cursed absolutism, up to the last moment, grew wider. [Even during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feelings which had heen shown,
the awful events in Adana took place and the souls of all true Osmanlis melted into tears.
Up to the present time the deep sorrow caused by this event has not disappeared, because this
bloody wound in our social body cannot easily be cured. While we fill our stomachs with

no tape wpile we rest selfishly in our comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans, widows hungry, naked, and barefoot wander hither and thither, and thousands of
families are fleeing from the fatherland. We are convinced that the government is doing its
work, but what has happened is so great a calamity that it ean keep a government busy for
years. However much sacrifice we may make, still it will be inadequate, because the
happiness of the fatherland depends on healing such blood wounds as these as soon as possible.
We are convinced that the government and all connected with it are persuaded of this as well as
ourselves. We must now wipe out the traces of the misfortune brought by a cursed period.
We must now comfort weeping hearts. We must understand aud teach those who do not
understand that patriotism and brotherhood d> not_differ from each other. _The responsibility
of the government for Nettie tWey-OUE etl WE HUEY Met hole Ottoman
nation is under obligations to protect this suffering race, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
is in large part due to the blood shed by the Armenians. We thought that these truths
were so obvious that we preferred fo keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary from time to time to recall the greatness of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yesterday has endured only barbarism, and for twelve years
has been cons\amthe ogpreted and ground to the earth, and has given thousands of victims.
Hereafter we must work to assure them that the era of massacres has passed, and with all our
strength of mind and soul we aust quiet them. The obligation of the government to protect
them is also very heavy, because our Armenian countrymen live among wandering tribes.
We must all assist the government and point out its obligation. It must b largd in
public aud periodically that the one of the most important duties of the OttomyA ngtionfis to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and pfopefty
Armenians as well, since these are their saered rights. Let imvestigations bé malgAn€ let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim.”
