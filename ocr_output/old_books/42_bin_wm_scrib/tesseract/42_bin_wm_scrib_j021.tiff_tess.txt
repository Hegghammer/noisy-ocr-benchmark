CANING SUGGESTIONS 17
holes are bored and ‘utilized in the cane weaving. ‘These are not
absolutely necessary; in fact caned areas on many pieces of period
and modern furniture do not utilize corner holes. In such instances ony
two diagonal strands are run in each hole on either sjdg €
corner. A comparison of the areas, the one ng a corner
hole, and the other not, will lead the observer“ conclude that the

Many pieces of so-called expensive furniture have ragged, exposed
caning. This is unsightly and is not to be commended.

Wherever it is found desirable to leave cane natural, it is neces-
sary thatthe-feame be stained before caning is begun. Box fuming
will not permanently color cane. Oil stains make no appreciable
impression if rubbed off at once. But water, acid, and alcohol
stains produce decided colors. If the worker desires Cb
