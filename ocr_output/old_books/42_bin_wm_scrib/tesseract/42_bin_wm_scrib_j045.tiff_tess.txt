ush seating, employing either genuine rush or substitutes, may
be gone to good advantage and with excellent results in manual
4ining shops. No equipment is needed to maintain such work.
The addition of a woven seat to a chair or stool constructed in the
shops will necessarily employ a new, interesting medium in con-
junction with woodwork; and materially increase the pupils’ knowl-
edge of materials and possible combinations. And, as with caning,

introduction in manual trainig shops. Rush’ seating employs a very
simple weave. Different materials employed in weaving naturally
require different degrees of skill, and the difficulties encountered
