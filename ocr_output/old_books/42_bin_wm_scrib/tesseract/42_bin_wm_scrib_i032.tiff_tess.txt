THE LUSITANIA’S LAST VOYAGE
True, there was no panic, in the sense that oy
anyone crowded or pushed his way to <t
lifeboats, but there was 1 woe
and there seemed no one to take command of
O any one boat.
As I came out on the starboard side, I
saw, a little aft of the main entrance, a
lifeboat well filled with people, principally
nRournrnensyomen and children, that no one had at-
tempted to clear from the davits. The
steamer was rapidly sinking, and I realized (/-
| that the boat must be cleared at once if
the people were to be saved.
I'climbed into the stern of the boat, which
T was floating flush with the rail of deck B,
_so far had the steamer settled, and helped
clear the fall. We freed our end and swung
the ropes clear, but we couldn’t make anygye
for’ard understand what to do or if be)
do it. TS /
