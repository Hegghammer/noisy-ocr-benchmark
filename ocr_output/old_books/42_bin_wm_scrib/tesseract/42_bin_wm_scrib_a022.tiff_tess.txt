of the Porte have been unreasonably forgotten or neglected. They are Cagh
as wretched as the Slavs or Cretans have been; and in so far off,
that in Europe there exists no large body of types € murder and
robbery its regular and daily occupation as th urds, and latterly the
Circassians also, have done in Armenia. If anyote will take the trouble to
the complaints of oppressions and cruelties presented to the Porte by
he Armenian Patriarchate in 1872 (since reprinted in England) and some ot
the fAore recent statements printed by the Armenians in England on the
he topic, he will see that the state of Turkish Asia presents a8 grave and

pressing a problem as that of Bulgaria itself.”

In the 4th edition of the same book, published in 1896, the following
note appears to the passage I have quoted:

‘Shortly after this was written, the Blue Books presented to Parlia-

ren eugining reports from British Consuls in Asiatic Turkey, showed
that things were really far worse there than they had been in Bulgaria or
Herzegovina.”

What has followed since 1876 is too well known. For seeking redrés
from their frightful grievances the Armenians were hunted like wild bea
and killed like rats and flies during the Hamidian régime.

You will tell me, my christian friends, that with the rise of the reform
party in ‘Turkey the era_of massacres is at_an a and will tell you that
the conditions of MS7O° aml T8596" Nave not Acttially changed, though they
may seemingly appear so to the uninformed and uninitiated. I will answer
you that the hideous massacres of April last happened nine months after the
reform party first rose in power, and nine months after the inauguration of
the Constitution, 1 do not question the goodwill of the reform party, but
the refottiparty does not comprise the whole Turkish nation, and until the
Turk learns to become liberal, civilized and human, there may be no more
Armenians left, unless some Christian Power such as the United States
demands their protection and enforces it. No! my Christian fignds) it can
be well for other Christians in the Turkish Empire with £hefr pow
Governments at their back; but alas! there is no security f yjec /
people alien in race and religion.

= —— The massacres in April last raged fromf Adan to Alexandretta, ani .
according to authenticated reports about fift\thg¥sand men, women and
children were hideously exterminated; more than this, the last massacres
were especially characterized by the most hideous, the most loathsome, the
most revolting and ferocious cruelties perpetrated on women and children.
