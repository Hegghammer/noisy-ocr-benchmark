PART I Af
THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIY.
mee the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe at ihe famous
Cpesfess of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the still more famous Treaty
f Bertig, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
3 lel in history.
In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Goyernments of Europe,
but in the interests of Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin written in letters of blood
no emncniartiood).
It was a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of “the
terrible stronghold of Kars,” universally admitted to be one of the greatest
and most difficult military exploits ever achieved, and the crowning success
of the Russian arms in Asiatic Turkey, should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General; that although Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest, anc Armenian soldiers fought, conquered and
died, yet by these successes not only was no_amelioration attained of the
hard fate of their“inbeaoy” Merton nie SPM fe he tat fate, hard
T before, was made a hundredfold and even a thousandfold harder.
