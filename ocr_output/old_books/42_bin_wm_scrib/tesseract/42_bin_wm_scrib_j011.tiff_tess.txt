Caninc; THE SEVEN STE
‘hat caning has not been undertaken to any appreciable extent .
n sthool shops is due to the fact that instructors are unfamiliar
wiph the weaving processes. Caning is not difficult. It, in common /
with many other lines of activity, is best learned thru observation. .
However, it may be undertaken by the average person after careful
study of printed directions and illustrations. If the worker will
closely observe his own work as it progresses, and follows instruc-_
reo rrreonmrentefully, he should have no unusual difficulty in caning an
area very acceptably in the initial attempt. Particular attention
should be paid to directions which tell of errors to avoid. Errors (/-
creep in, in a very unobtrusive manner at times, and the amateur
| will find them hard to detect.
