PREFACE pe
On the analogy of the famous apple,—‘‘there ain’t
Wng to be no’’ preface, ‘‘not nohow.’’ Children do
ngt read prefaces, so anything of a prefatory nature
at might interest them is put at the beginning of chap-
ter one.
As for the grown-ups the story is not written for grown- .
ups, and if they want to know why it begins with such a
neUW we-reesune first chapter, let them ask the children. Chil-
dren like the horrors first and the end all bright. Many
grown-ups like the tragedy at the end. But perhaps the (/-
children are right and the grown-ups are standing on
| their heads. Besides they can skip the first chapter; it is
only a prologue.
