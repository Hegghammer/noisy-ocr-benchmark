MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE.
«It will be seen by the engraving that the old house is double: ” The ©
a avestern part is that which was, built. by Barnabas. in 1659-60. : ‘The : Cees
"east or two-story part was built by Jonathan I., about 1682. Theupper9
> room of this part was used for a court-house for nearly twenty years,
-as we learn. from Thompson’s History of Long Island, and some of
the old benches used when it was a. court-house are’ still preserved.
The old ‘castle,’ as Jonathan G. Horton, its last Horton occupant, oe
used to call it, is in all probability the oldest wood house in America. ees A

"were a few huts'on the east of Long Island previous to 1640—two or
three it is said on Shelter Island... But these, as well as those buileby
the Puritans, immediately on their settlement in Southold, soon all)

With a few repairs, the old castle may yet stand for generations far
