As these sheets are going through the press there comes news offamine
at Zeitoon. The Rev. F. W. Macullaum, American Missionary at Marash,
- writes to the Rev. \W. W. Peet, American Missionary at Constantinople, that =~
~.12,000-souls in and around Zeitoon are dying of hunger; theyare wandering =
_ -about in. rags, mixing bran and water, and cooking and eating it, if they can
-. get even that. Rev. Macullum adds, ‘The same story comes to us fromall |
sides. As we foresaw all along, from now on the distress will be greatest.”
If 50,000 were massacred, the list of those who have died and are dying
of homelessness and starvation will exceed 150,000. It is true; and the =
numbers are not exaggerated. Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are nosowings.
The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered ina nightattack =
_ byarmed Kurds, and the villagers are now reduced toextreme distress. Before
~ the outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush hadrepéatedly appealed
~~ .to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch. |
_ had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec.
~ tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It is.

_ evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
. Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
