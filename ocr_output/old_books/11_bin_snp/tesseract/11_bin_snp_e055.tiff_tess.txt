| wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus describes a company’of |
| ladies. They were, says he, “clothed all alike, in kirtles with rich capes |
| or mantles, parti-coloured, white, and blue, embroidered all over with [|
| various devices.” ‘Their bodies are described as being long and small, |
~- | and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though each of them =,

| richly-striped wires of gold, and upon their kerchiefs they had. each of | Ee
