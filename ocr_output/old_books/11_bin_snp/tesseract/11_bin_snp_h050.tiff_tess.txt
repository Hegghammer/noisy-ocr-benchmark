stances; L remained with them until I was seventeen, working on the
farm in the summer, and going to school in the winter, thus acquiring
“merely a common-school education.’ When-I was-seventeen years old,
at the suggestion of my parents, I decided to learn the blacksmith
trade, and commenced the - business at “once, and served an appren-
. = ticeship for several “years, “On the 17th of October, 1827, I married
“Phebe Tompkins, and on the gth of March, 1820, we moved to Peeks-«
9. kill village, where we have resided ever since, I bought some pro-
_.- perty, and set up the blacksmithing business. I succeeded well in the.
business. In the ‘spring of 1835 I entered into a co-partnership busi- |
