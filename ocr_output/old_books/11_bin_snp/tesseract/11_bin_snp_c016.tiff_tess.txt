| "THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
And that is the way that the story of The Boy

_ Apprenticed to an Enchanter used to begin,
But. first I shall have to tell you about King
Manus and his three horses.
es King Manus ruled over the Western Island, and — te
he had a castle that was neither higher nor wider
than any other King’s castle. Buthehadastable
that was more strongly built than any other King’s
stable. It had double walls of stone; it had oak =~
beams; it had an iron door with four locks to it.
And before this door two soldiers with drawn __
-_ swords in their hands stayed night and day.
& — : In those days, if one went before a King and — ce
asked him for a gift the King might not refuse to
: cS give what was asked of him. But King Manus eae
was hard to come to by those with requests. For :
before the chamber where he sat or slept there
stood a servant to take the request, and if it were. e os oo
one that might not be brought tohim,tomakean
-exeuseforthe King,
It was all because of the King’s three horses—
_. a white horse, a red horse, and a’black horse.
‘The white horse was as swift as the plunging wave
