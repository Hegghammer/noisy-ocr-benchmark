SEAT WEAVING
strands are interwoven with the first. The over and under weave
is used. Each alternate row of each series is either over or under.
The first diagonal strands run over the preceding two series. They
are not woven as in seven-step caning. The second diagonal strands
run over the first diagonals and under the intersection of the other
strands, including every alternate first diagonal. This resolves
itself into simple over and under weaving. Note that but one
strand of a diagonal enters a corner hole. This is not true of seven-

DAVENPORT WITH CANED P√ÅNELS,
step caning, as elsewhere indicated. It is advisable to utilize a
wider cane in the first two steps, than is used in the subsequent ones.
The Design Element.-Caning is not a fad. Cane was com-
monly used in Carolean furniture in England about 1660, and has
continued in use for seating purposes thru the various subsequent
periods. The application of cane as used today on French furniture,
as in panels, is historically wrong. However there can be no valid
objection to its use in panels if no attempt is made to name it a
true period style. Also it must be conceded that period furniture
was not always well designed, and there can be no well sustained
objection to the use of cane in panels, provided it is in keeping
structurally and decoratively with the particular piece of furniture.
