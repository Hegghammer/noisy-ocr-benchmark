quenched. On his head was a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.
Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest men-Morditch
Khrimian,
Katholikos of the Armeniau Charch, and soul of the Armenian people-slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or The Only-Begotten
is Descended.' From the window of a neighboring 10011 hr might have looked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now all eut close and huried
for
the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling snow and hurricane that hid
the
cone of Ararat. And jnst beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Delage,
On
the
shore of that lake, eighty-seven years ago, Khrimian tras born. In 1820 the
Turkisli
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land; the Sultan still counted as one of the
formid-
able l'owers of Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Grecce from his
tyranny, and establishred for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom-a
reputation still ratlier pathetically survives throughout the Near East. Long and
stormy
had been the life upon which the Katholikos now looked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to last it lind been inspired by one absorbing and unselfish aim-the freedom and
regeneration of his people. It is true he had failed.
From his carliest years, when lie had witnessed the terrors of Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality-such a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance aniong
the
prosperous and contented of the world. He began as a poet, wandering far and wide through
the
Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of Armenia, visiting Constautinople and Jernsalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glories of their national
history,
Entering the monastic order after his wife's deatli, he devoted himiself to the building of
schools,
which he generously threw open to Kurds, the hereditary assassins of Armenians.
For
many
years, while Europe was occupied with Crimcan wars, Austrian wars, or French and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying from Van to Constantiuople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, thougli continnally defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, lis sacred emblems of the Host hung in hookery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenían patriarch of Constantinople (1869), he was driven from
his office after four years.
But the eup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiless shaugliter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could-stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to plead his people's cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Europe
beforehand, urging them to create an autonomous nentral state for Armenia, as they
had
done with success for the Lebanon. In London he becamo acquainted with Gladstone; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which hail kindled the lieart of England,
and,
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey's definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London nmid shouts of " Pence with Honor,'
and Armenia was left to stew.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by hris own people, ho
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians irere slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake
