Church, but was also a fearless patriot- distinguished linguist, an elogaent preacher, and a
thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being hade for the Berlin Congress, it was lie who,
in
spite of the feared fanatical ipprising of the Turks, threw prudenee to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history.
At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nercès, the Patriareh, their object lieing to request the signatory lowers of
the Berlin Treaty to force A guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.
Abdul Hamid and his advisers were furious at this affront, and Monseigneur Nercès was
summoned to the Palace. It is said that when lie received the summions he simply smiled
and asked one of of his curates to read the Burial Service to him, as lie did not expect to
return alive. Howeyer, he trent. No one has exer heard what passed between the Sultan
and
himself at the interview suffice it to say that he immediately summoned the Armenian
General Assembly and tendered his resignation. This not accepted by the Assembly,
and, amidst enthusiastie cheers, lie mas carried back to his apartments at the Patriarchate
Meanwhile a peremptory order reached him, signed by the Sultan, to recall the Armeuian
delegation
from Berlin. This Monseigneur Varjabétian point-blank refused to do, and retired
to his private resilence at Haskeuy, R village on the Golden Horn. The suceess of the dele-
gation,
howeyer,
did not come up to his expectations. The Armenians, as it happened, could
not be heard, but they were so far successful as to have an article inserted in the treaty.
The Sultan and his advisers never forgave the Patriareli thris, though they could not
openly do anything to him on account of his enormous popalarity. Time passed on, and to
all
appearance the incident was forgotten, but it was not so. One suminier afternoon a most
cordial invitation was sent by a very high dignitary of the Palace, requesting the Arehhishop
to
dine
with him informally. An invitation of this kind could not very well be refused, so
the Archbishop, accompanied only by a body-servant named Yartan, repaired to the Pasha's
house. The Pasha received him at the iloor and escorted the visitor with much ceremony and
extreine courtesy to a private apartment of the salamlik of his house (the men's quarters),
where dinner was served. The geniality displayed by his host dispelled any fears that the
Archbishop might have had as to his personal safety.
After dinner, as nsual, coffee was served. Now, this serving of the coffée is rather a
ceremonial according to high Turkish etiquette, and it is not unusal for guests to bring their
own tchooboukdar (the servant who carries his master's pipe and pouch and also superintends
the making of his coffee). The Archbishop was presented with a "tehoobouk" (pipe) filled
and lighted for smoking, and n servant followed with coffee. The Archbishop necepted hoth
with dne compliments to his host, and took a sip at his coffee. Just nt that montent
the
leayy curtains over the doorway were tlirown apart, revealing the ghastly pale face of liis
servant Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, in a voice trembling with emotion,
"Monseigueur,
I dia not brew the coffee!
This was enough for the Archbishop ; he pretended to Lie startled and spilt the coffée, but,
alas ! he lind already drunk a small quantity of it. Meanwhile a seuflle was gotug on behind
the portiere, where his poor servant Vartan was paying the penalty of lris devotion to his
master. Concerning I Tartan's whereabouts or his ultimate end nothing was ever made pablie
the poor fellow simply vanished. Monseigneur Varjabétian, after a short interval thanked
the Pashn for liis generous and kind hospitality and took hrs departure. On the way home he
was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily summoned. The Patriarchi took to his bed,
and lost all his hair through the effects of the poison. Then, one horning, when a servant
