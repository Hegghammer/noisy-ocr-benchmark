caution used to avoid breaking strands.

Rectangular Seats.— As stated, in weaving a square seat the

initial process is repeated at all corners until all openings are filled.

impossible. Fig. 42 shows a partly woven seat with the short rails
filled, and the process of filling up the remaining area under way.
The method is this: Go over and under a long rail, across half the
frame opening and up thru, then across the remaining distance, arfa@ ~~

pleted. Fig 43 is a aigfot partly woven seat, illustrating the
method of filling in #he ter just described. It supplements the
photograph and makes the method clearer.

It should be noted that the strands in crossing at the center must
be compressed one-half of their diameters. They will need to be
tapped sharply with a small mallet or hammer to produce proper
crowding, Fig. 44 shows a stool seat of fiber woven by an eighth
grade boy. Fig. 45 shows the complete stool. “The seat is woven
