Motto.‘ Quop Vutt, Vatpr Vutt,”—What he wills, he wills cordially and without stint.
Arms are hereditary, but the mottoes are not, and may be changed to suit the taste or fancy of
any family. There are other Arms of the Horton family, varying somewhat from the above. The
date of the grant of the arms I have not found—probably many centuries ago.
