WHY AND ee a
In making“study of my race, I have found three marked characteristics
niga te) 9—Ind. Combined with these three characteristics
is an intens\Léve of Nationality. We live in a complex world. In an
independent people these characteristics and this sentiment are laudable
Virtues. In a subject people they are Crimes.
After I had laid this bitter Truth to heart, I did not have to seek for the
Why art Wtrefetete et the Armenian Massacres.
The Armenian Massacres stand without their parallel in history. [1
human mind staggers to contemplate the fiendish orgies of which they hyve

work of extermination-may—be completed—Jesus Christ was crucified on
Calvary and the servant is not greater than his Lord—but the work of their
extermination can only be completed when the evil influences in urkish

point is reached, they must re-act on Christeft0m and the natural
consequence must follow. Those who sow the wind, must reap the whirl-

The question therefore resolves itself into this critical point: “What will
Christendom do even now?”
