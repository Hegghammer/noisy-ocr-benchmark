of the Porte have been unreasonably forgotten or neglected, ‘They are fully
as wretched as the Slavs or Cretans have been ; and in so far worse off,
that in Europe there exists no large body of tribes making murder_and
robbery its regular and daily occupation as the Kurds, and lat Lae
Circassians also, have done in Armenia. If anyone will take ouble to
read the complaints of oppressions and cruelties Brg to the Porte by
the Armenian Patriarchate in 1872 (since reprinte{in England) and some ot
the more yetEnt statements printed by the Armenians in England on the
same toy vill see that the state of Turkish Asia presents a8 grave and
ane (Physi as that of Bulgaria itself.”

In the 4th edition of the same book, published in 1896, the following
note appears to the passage I have quoted:

‘Shortly after this was written, the Blue Books presented to Parlia-
ment, containing reports from British Consuls in Asiatic Turkey, showed

What has followed since 1876 is too well known. For seeking (fre

reform party first rose in power, and nine months after the inauguration of
the Constitution. I do not question the goodwill of the reform party, but
the reform party does not comprise the whole Turkish natig#,Janfl until_the
Turk learns to become liberal, civilized and human, ane © pete
Armenians left, unless some Christian Power h as the ni ed tate /
demands their protection and enforces it. No YefyYhristian friends-tréan -
be well for other Christians in the Turkish mire with their powerful
Governments at their back; but alas! there is no security for a subj
people alien in race and religion.

The massacres in April last raged-trommdddana to Alexandretla, And
according to guthenticated reports about fifty thousand men, womdn fknd
children we ideously exterminated; more than this, the last massaWres

most revolting and ferocious cruelties perpetrated on women and children.
Now what other name can we find for the perpetrators of this diabolical
