Blow followed blow, Hardly had the remnant of the AYigepteff People escaped from
massacre when their Church fell under the bratal domination Russia. Plehve ordained its
destruction, a rolitzin was sent to Tiflis as governor-general to carry it out. Church
property to Migathe of £6,000,000 was seized by violence, the Natholikos resolutely refusing
to give up fhe keyyJof the safe where the title deeds were kept (June, 1903). For two years
the RussiakoftigMils played with the revenues, retaining eighty per cent. for their own
advantage. ut in the mean time assassination had rid the earth of Plehve, and the over-
whelining defeats of Russia in Manchuria were attributed to the Armenian curse. Gradgingly
the Church property was restored, in utter chaos, and for the moment it is Russia’s policy to
favor the Armenians as a balance against the Georgians, whom the St. Petersburg government
is now determined to destroy.

back that winter’s morning. Singleness of aim has its reward in spiritual peace, but of
future he was not hopeful. He no longer even contemplated an autonomous Armenif, gfther
on ‘furkish territory or on Russian. On the Russian side of the frontier the Adnfenian
villages were too scattered, too much interspersed with Georgians and ‘Tartars, to! allow
of autonomy. On the Turkish side, he thought, massacre and exile had now left too few of
the race to form any kind of community. Indeed, for the last twelve years the Armenian
villagers have been crawling ever the foob ofA a rat by thousands gycar to escape the Kurds,
and every morning they come and stand in iresh groups of pink and Blue rags outside the
Monastery door where the head of their Church and race lics dying. They stand there in
mute appeal, as I suw them, possessing nothing in the world but the variegated tatters

cover them, and their faith in their Iatholikos. Slowly they ure drafted away into
Tiflis, Baku, or their Caucasian villages, but nowhere are they welcomed.

Some of the bishops and monks, who form a council round their chief, still look for
Europe’s interference, and trust that the solemn pledges taken by England and other Powers
at Berlin may be fulfilled. ‘The Bishop of Evivan, for instance, still laborstpr the appoint-

Whatever may be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, 1 think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could he
