THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE, 29

Oriental figure of speech, is said to have been ‘ravisheg b s ‘auty
of her sandals.” Like the belles of Egypt she did not agdain, in setting
off her chgems, to have recourse to perfumes and cosmetics, and
previously/té set}ing out she ‘anointed herself with precious ointment.’
In anotheXplaeé Jezebel is said to ‘paint her eyelids; and Solomon, in
the Proverbs, in describing the deceitful woman, adjures his son not to
be ‘taken with her eyelids,’ evidently alluding to the use of collyrium.
The Jewish beauty owed no slight obligation to her luxuriant tresses,
which, werp decprated with waving plumes and strings of pearls; and
in allusion to this custom, followed among the tribes from time imme-
morial, St. Paul affirms that ‘a woman’s ornament is her hair.? Judith
‘braided the hair of her head and put a tire upon it ;? and the headdress
of Pharaoh’s daughter, in the Canticles, is compared by Solomon to
Carmel. No mention is made of Judith’s mirror, hut it was yndoubtedly
ade of brass, like those described in Exodus xxxvili, 8 as ‘the
looking-glasses of the women which assembled at the door of the

ernacle of the congregation.’ ” |
