Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Enypsre
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this super-added_ evil gi\ Kae
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, gseater ers and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation e lives comprises
murder and rgbbery, and who have through weary tenturies unremittingly
quartered ves upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits df theiJlabour and toil. Indeed as the Hamidieh cavalry which
was establi expressly for the Hamidian massacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized murder, can now find for those habits in
which they were encouraged and trained to indulge by the Hamidiaa
régime,

Under all such conditions no hope of better days can be forthcoming
no prospect of better times seems possible, for that unhappy portion 1€
Armenian race whom force of circumstances keeps on the soil o\/the

| fatherland.
The appointment of Christian governors over the provinces  in-
habited by them might amelosresemncalthanisecthewsher alternative,
WE allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespective of creed or
ationality, would furnish some means of selfdefence against the raids
barbarities of the oppressors; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christian_peasaat subject to Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his enemies, must remain one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Notthesmost fertile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the n siduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, Lis oe the
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that tom /
happisess, and_security of life and property, whigh/th} law of all civiltzed -
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer ahd tHler of the soil.
