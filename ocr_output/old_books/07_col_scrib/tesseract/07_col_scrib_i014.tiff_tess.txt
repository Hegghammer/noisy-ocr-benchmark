THE ZONE
Avert Thy gaze, O God, close tight Thine eyes!
Glapge dawn, no longer on the ocean foam,
Lest Thou behold such horrors as can turn
Men’s burning hearts to ice, and chill their souls.
| Keep Thine heart warm and full of charity
That Thou mayst yet be able to forgive,
And pity feel for those who’kno fot whet
Ti To pause in deeds of ruthless sacrifice.
Restrain Thy wrath, and keep Thine hand in
check;
Smite not, nor fiercely thrust without the pale
Those who can dare to strew the ocean waste
With fellow creatures, innocent of wrong.
Ferget the_studied purpose to destroy; G
The launching of the missile through the deep;
The shattered hull; the crushed and bleeding forms;
» ‘The seething swirl of wreckage, women, men.
