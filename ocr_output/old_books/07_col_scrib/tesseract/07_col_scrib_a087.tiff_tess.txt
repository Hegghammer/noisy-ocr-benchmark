Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have clung to their christian faith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure. ay

The cathedral of Etchmiatzin built by Gregory s to-day ; it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part <fr other, until perhaps
little of the oxf@inal building may be left, but it still claims to be the church
built by th patrgn saint of Armenia. I shall here quote a passage from
“Historical Shétch of the Armenian Church,” written by an Armenian
priest :

“Owing to political circumstances the Armenian Patriarchate had at
times to be transferred to metropolises and to other principal towns of
Armenia, In the year A.D. 452 it was removed to Dwin, in 993 to Ani,
in 1114 to Réomklah and in 1294 to Sis. The Kingdom of Cilicia becoming
extinct, and, we having no more a kingdom and no longer a capital town/ it
was natural and proper to re-transfer the See to its own original ee
the entire nation unanimously desired it. Accordingly, in the year 14.1, it

| was decided by an ecclesiastical meeting that the seat of the Catholicus should
return to Holy Etchmiatzin, where to this day has been preserved the
per unbroken succession from our Apostles and from cur holy Father,

C # Gregory the Illuminator.”

I read the other day in one of the foreign papers published in Japan,
the following piece oFtfeWs: ;

“An Armenian Church pronounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christian era, has been discovered in a fair statypf yreserva-
tion in the neighbourhood of Bash-Aparnah.” (V)

Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Dsofessor’ (bE /
conducting might lead to throwing more light on cee history. :
