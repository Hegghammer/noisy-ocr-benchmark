was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples whieh with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armenian, It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who eng in
ecommerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase theguehe Of
the Ottoman Empire. Beeause a few among them justly started 39 agitatigr sé our noble
and industrious brethren were being massacred. What a (4yé scene! When we
left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our &¥menian compatriots being
removed in man arts ; legs and arms were hanging down outside. ‘This bloody scene will
ever remain infec on my mind. _,

“ This Reo). of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course o irsed absolutism, up to the last moment, grew wider. Lven during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly teclings which had been shown,
the awful events in Adana took place and the souls of all true Osmanlis melted into tears.
Up to the present time the deep sorrow caused by this event has not disappeared, beeause this
bloody wound in our social body cannot easily be cured. While we fill our stomachs with
choice morsels, while we yest selfishly in our comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphams HOMER EA NE sec, and barefoot wander hither and thither, and thousands of
families are fleeing from the fatherland. We are convinced that the government is doipg yf
work, but what has happened is so great a calamity that it can keep a government buy for
years. Ilowever much sacrifice we may make, still it will be inadequate, becausdfthe
happiness of the fatherland depends on healing such blood wounds as these as soon as possible.
We are convineed that the government and all connected with it are persuaded of this as well as
ourselves. We must now wipe out the traces of the misfortune brought by a eursed period.
We must now comfort weeping rena “(We wmsinunlosctandndeichchose who do not

ofthe government for the Armenians is very great and very weighty. The whole Ottoman
hation is under obligations to protect this suffering race, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
fimtarge part due to the blood shed by the Armenians. We thought that these truths
were so obvious that we peeferredeto keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary from time to time to recall the greatness of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yesterday has endured only barbarism, and for twelve years
has been constantly oppressed and ground to the earth, and has given thousggts of victims.
Hereafter we must work to assure them that the era of massaeres has passed, Ang wih all
strength of mind and soul we must quiet them. The obligation of the govdrnipey rot

protect, together with those of other races, the interests, ife, and property of the
Armenians as well, since these are their saered rights. Let investigations be made and let
whatever is necessary be done im order to reach this aim.”
