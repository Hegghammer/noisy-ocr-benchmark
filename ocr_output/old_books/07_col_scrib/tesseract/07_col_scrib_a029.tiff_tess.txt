THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN. omit

Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Jturop KANE famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the s e famous Treaty
of Bertin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenia’ nation stands without
its parallel jf Pistory.

In thd Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in wht city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted

an Armenian General; that although Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquestnandnvenarsaldicrs Quah conquered and

te, yet by these successes not only was no amelioration attained of the
rd fate of their unhappy nation under Turkish rule, but that fate, hard

e, was made a hundredfold and even a thousandfold harder.
