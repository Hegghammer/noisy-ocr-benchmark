THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE. 13
Investigation proves to us that the taste for slendeywaist eviited
even more in the Eastern nations than in those of Euggpe, and we find
that other pwreans besides that of compression have been extensively
taken sie) of. Humboldt, in his personal narrative, describes the
women 0 / and informs us that the reddish clay called “ampé” is
eaten by them in order that they may become slim, want of plumpness

will be best segn by a quotation from a recent traveller who writes on
the atic of
