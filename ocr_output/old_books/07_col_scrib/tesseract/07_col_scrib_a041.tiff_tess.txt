like a round bow, a great brown cye revealed the inward spirit’s intelligence and zeal un-
quenched. On his head was a close-titting cap of purple velvet.

Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century’s greatest men—Mgzdttel
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian peop sient
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Mtchmiatzin, or “ Tu Begotten
is Descended.” From the window of a neighboring room he Plightsbtd Tooked across the
frost hound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now aut close and huried for the
winter. Beyondthe plain stood a dark mass of whirling suow and hurricane that hid the
cone of Arargt nd just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of thtMake) eighty-seven years ago, Khrimian was born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was\still yAdiminished by sea or land ; the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able Powers Europe. It was four years before Byron sect out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom—a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Near East. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Natholikos now looked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to last it had been inspired by one absorbing and unselfish aim—the freedom and
regeneration of his people, It is trac he had failed.

From his earliest years, when he had witnessed the terrors of Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round .Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality—sugh a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dics away into easygoing tolerance ambnf& the
prosperous and contented of the world. THe began as a poet, wandering far and wide tWrough

| the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wife’s death, he devoted himself to the building of schools,
which he generously threw ofr Soe METH ete of Atienians. For many
ars, while Europe was occupied with Crimean wars, Austrian wars, or French and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying from Van to Constantinople and through the
itics of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emblems of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When electe@tTnfénian patriarch of Constantinople (1869), he was driven from

his office after four years.

But the cup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiless slaughter of-Pulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. WAhfvarfed motises
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, aid Axl fipett fi
himself summoned to plead his people’s cause before the Coygsess of Berke “Choufli he /
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited/% ie great courts of Eu S

done with suceess for the Lebanon. In London he hecame aiuted with Gladstone ; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing fer his people beyond the promises ff
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in cheek afd
enforce Turkey’s definite reforms. It is net NMAC erie of these promisks afd
pledges were obserfg 3eaconstield returned to London amid shouts of “ Peace with Hof,”
and Armenia wasffett to stew.

So it wht dr Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Kutholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake-
