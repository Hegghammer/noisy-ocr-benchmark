10 THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.

belles of the tribe were not slow in discovering that, whe ye
in all the panoply of forest finery, a belt well drawrfpg—4¥ shown in the

first i\dicatién of the use of the corset as an article of becoming attire. |
At the very first dawn of civilisation there are distinct evidences of the
use of contrivances for the reduction and formation of the female figure. |
Researches among the ruins of Polenqui, one of the mysterious forest cities |
of Sonth America, whose history is Jost in remote antiquity, have brought
to Tight most singular evidences of the existence of a now forgotten
race. Amongst the works of art discovered there is a bas-relief repr
senting a female figure, which, in addition to a profusion of massiy

| omaments, wears a complicated and elaborate waist-bandage, which,
by a system of circular and transverse folding and looping, confines the
waist from just below tie *Tibs-ti ihe Tips asirmly“andcompactly as
the most unyielding corset of the present day.

At the period of the discovery of some of the islands of the
Eastern Archipelago was found customary for all young females to
wear a peculiar kind of corset, formed of spirally-arranged rattan
cane, and this, when once put on, was not removed until the celebration
of the marriage ceremony. Such races as were slowly sro) th

made sufficiently broad to fit without undue friction, and stiff enough to
prevent folding together in the act of stooping, sitting, or moving
about, at once became in effect cofSets;“andstiefested to the minds
of the ingepiotis a system of cutting and fitting so as more perfectly to
adapt t to the figure of the wearer. The modes of fastening, as
we shall see, have been various, from the simple sewing together with
the lace to the costly buckle and jewelled loop and stud.
