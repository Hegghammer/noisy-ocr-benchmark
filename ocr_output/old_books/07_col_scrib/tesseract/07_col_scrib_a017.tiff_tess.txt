of blackened ruins, the stark walls of the churehes and houses rising up out of the ashes and
charred timbers heaped on every side, What must it mean to the five thousand meu and
women and little children who have survived a painful flight to the seacoast and hay OT
returned to their mountain home, only to find their houses sacked and burned! ‘LygjAuvtfe

nine Christian villages whieh clustered about Kessab in the valleys below, Several of these

have been completely destroyed by tire. All have been snipes

driven out or slain.”

“Can you pert@ine the feelings of the Kessab people as they climbed on foot the tong trail
up the serge as they came over the ridge into full view of their charred and
ruined dwellidgs ? ‘Yheir stores of wheat, barley and rice had been burned ; clothing, cooking
utensils, furniNwefid tools had gone; their goats, cows and mules had been stolen ; their silk
industries stamped out ; their beloved churches reduced to smouldering heaps. The bodies of
their friends and relatives who had been killed had not been buried. And yet the love of
home is so strong that the people have settled down there with the determination to clear up
the debris and rebuild their houses.” —Extracts from “ The Sack of Kessab,” Stephen Van h.

writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet, American Missionary at Constantinople, ‘that
12,000 souls in and around Zeitoon are dying of hunger ; they are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran and water, and cooking and eating it, if they can

teven that. Rev. MACiANte TNE wane Story COMES to us from all
(les. As we foresaw all along, from now on the distress will be greatest.’

If 50,000 were massacred, the list of those who have died and are dying
of homelessness and_staryation will exceed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerated. Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.

The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian vifAge phat had
