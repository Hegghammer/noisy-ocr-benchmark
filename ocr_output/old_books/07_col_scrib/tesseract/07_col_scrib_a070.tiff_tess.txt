In the foregoing pages I have directed my humble efforts to sketch out
what the POree Or Europe have done in the past, and how their actions
have reflected on my unfortunate race.

It is considered good policy now by a certain class of European \writers
to ascribe all the horrors of the Armeriian Massacres to Hamid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as unassailable and unconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as_a sort of superhuman being who swept everything

efore him to the constmmation of his own despotic wil, The reason for

this is not difficult to perceive. They would fain disavow the part Europe
has played in the tragedy, and to do this successfully it becomes necessary
also to present Turkey to the world now as a paradise (from whence the
tyrant once removed) peopled only by saints and angels; so we have also
many roseate colored word pictures of Constitutional Turkey.

The murders, deportations and imprisonments of the #rkish revolu-
tionaries, or more correctly reformers, were undoubtedly phe sole sore
Abdul Hamid and his palace clique, but Abdul apd his iminivrs Coif /
hexe carried out that hellish work of wholfSafe) extermination Â© ee
Armenians without the perpetration and 1A of the Turkish
people. It is true the massacres were originated and organized in th
Palace, the Palace clique stirred up religious fanaticism and race hatred, fut
the co-operation of the people was nggessary,.apd the people co-ojerated
in order to pl~ndex and enrich themselves with the worldly goods tligt [the
Armenians affys knew how to acquire by their own industry and toil\\the
appeal to Welt marauding and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
