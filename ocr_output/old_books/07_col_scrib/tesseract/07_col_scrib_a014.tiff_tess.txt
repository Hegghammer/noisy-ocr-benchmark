SCENE OF THE MASSACRES IN ASIA MINOR.

The trouble began in Adana. An armed mob strengthened and augmented by soldiers
fell in overwhelming numbers upon the unarmed Christians. The Armenian population of
Antioch and vicinity were practically wiped out and the Armenign villages in the
Alexandretta district destroyed with immense loss of life. Hadjim, hsgab and the neigh-
bouring villages were burned. ‘The Armenian quarter in Tarsus was/rufned and-opened
Marash stained again with the blood of thousands of Armenians. Zeitdon Wa dsolatfd: /
entire population of irikon between Aleppo and Ale: tia were massacred fo t St

hhc. Thewmob and the soldiers burned what they could fot gurry away, so that the material ~
loss has heen enormous. In place of the former abunda' d thriving industries there are
instead desolated provinces and the charred and blackened remains of pillaged and rujed
homes, and the residue of those who escaped massacre are reduced to 7
starvation,
