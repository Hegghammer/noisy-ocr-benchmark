and relate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
1796 after ruling over Armenia fifty-eight years. Wy

grew to be so mighty in battle that the neighbofPipg—pttons called his
country Aramia and the people were called Axgfians, such names as
Armenia or enians being no doubt later corruptions.

The (Epon of Aram was over Neuchar king of Media, whom he

to us, there scems to be grounds for supposing that the “A\ramzeans ”’
