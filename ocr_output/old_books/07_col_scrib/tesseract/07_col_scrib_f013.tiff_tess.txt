PREFACE 1x
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions :
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific jiger
( torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and aytyi villains, for whom of old no
mud wa thick and slab. Beliefs are being
assailed on every side. To abolish the traditional
courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the considerate
conduct of Captain Lind would, therefore, be
strokes of Me tnkindest, and I have here attempted
no such iconoclasm, Even where I cannot be-
lieve, I have told the tale—whenever it has been
| worth the telling—as it is found in criminal
trials, or in Smith opNolononngad pher,Anlgn
ources, decorously stripped of much vile language.
¢ / For really, where much that seems incredible
may be fully proved—and where the believable
turns out not rarely to be false, ’tis your only way.
To continue the story of the highwaymen from
Smith and Johnson down to the approaching end (])
of all such things in the beginning of the nm-
teenth céntury, is like taking up and concthey)
a half-told tale. But tw was worth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpin has
always made, has it been found really necessary
to srl ore and re-state the career of
that much-ovtrrated scoundrel, and to put him
in his proper place: a very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
