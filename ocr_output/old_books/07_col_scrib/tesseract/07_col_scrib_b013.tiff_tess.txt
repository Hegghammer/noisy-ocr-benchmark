CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.

Twat there has hitherto existed no good book of Engravings of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the progress of the student in that department of Art, is to be regretted. The talents
of Mr. Joun Scorr, brought into action by those of Grtprn, Cooppr, and the RernaGues,
have presented the public with excellent representations of the distinguished ornaments of the
turf: the sports of the field, and the habits and manners of the caning race, wese also duly
honoured: but of the ferocious TrGER tribe, and the lordly Lion, setae extn that
would bear critical inspection, beyond a few detached, pfinee> nothing like a collection of
figures, whose justness and accuracy of fi ion, character, and expression, might be
relied o .

Dpes any reader imagine that the various Etchings which have been performed—chiefly
abroad Nby Mtists of no mean ability, may be considered as exceptions? They are not exceptions :
or at best, the number which might be so regarded is but small, and those, for the most part, of
dimensions not accommodated to the drawer of the cabinet, or the shelf of the library.
rn Barnwenopobjectionable on this ground alone. Speaking of them in the aggregate, the
heavier charge lies against them of being insufficient to those purppses/of taste and information
which are the ends of Art. Even those after Trrran and after Rukixs (the latter of whom has

| perhaps painted a greater number than any other of the old masters) are far more deficient in

form, character, and expression, than isrenerally supposed, or than will be easily believed, by
those who have not actually compared them with the Lions, Leopards, and Tigers of Nature.
They have been taken too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
Nor is this intepded_toimpugn the merits, as historical or poetical painters, of those distinguished
Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that ps a painter of allegory, RubENs
might consider that strong infusion of /wman form, charfctdr, ad expression, by which his Lions,
for example, are distinguished, as necessary, or conduciye, tp hif aeforicglgfirposes y or, it is pos-
—sible that his knowledge of this animal may CO oroughlyAvell-gr, ad, and that he
may have faboured under early prejudice of mihd, or Af vision, in this "part of his”education as a
Painter, and may not have seen Lions as they really are. This is what thf writer is most inclined
to believe, (though not to insist); foreven, in treating the subject ofyDanfel in the den of Lions—
