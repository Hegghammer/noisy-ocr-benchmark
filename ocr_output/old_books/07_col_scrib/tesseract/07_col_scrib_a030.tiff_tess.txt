The efforts of the Armenians, and the entreaties of their Patriarch
Nerses had procured the insertion of Article 16 in the Treaty of San
Stefano signed between Russia and Turkey in March 1878. In he
wording of the Article had been suggested by the Patriarch ljiiset |
provided the following stipulation for the protectiog of th enians :—

‘ As the evacuation by the Russian troops he territory which they
now occupy-m Armenia, and which is to be restored to Turkey, might give
rise to (B: and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good
relation\ betyyeen the two countries, the Sublime Porte engages to carry into
effect witfout further delay the improvements and reforms demanded by
local requirements in the provinces inhabited by the Armenians, and to
guarantee their security against the Kurds and Circassians.”

What followed has passed into history. The British Government of
whienLetcch Beaconsfield (then Mr. D’Israeli) was Premier, and Lord Salis-
bury Foreign Secretary, once more pursued the old policy of baffling Rugstan
agerandizement in Turkey. Afraid that her own real or fancied fees
would thereby become imperilled, England threw in the weight of he\power,

| and virtually conmanded the substitution of the Treaty of Berlin in lieu of
the Treaty of San Stefano. Thus the substantial guarantee of a natural and
immediate protector, bottvable anddasireumol calexcinntbe protection which
the Armenians then had in Russia, was taken away, and the security of im-

¢ / potent words given in its stead, namely :— ,

“The Sublime Porte undertakes to carry out without further delay the
improvements aré-reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces
inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the
Circassians and Kurds. It will periodically make known thg-steps taken to
this effect to the Powers, who will superintend their applicafigh.)

“Tt will periodically make knowin the steps taken Ly ne /
Powers, who will superintend their applicatiysfF~ How this last groyise’ |
could furtsh food for laughter were it not for (Opin tragedy involved
in it.

The insertion of Article 61 in the Treaty of Berlin, granted, or rater
seemingly granted, by the six Powers of Europe, proved in reality, as fub-
sequent events bore out, an instrument ot cesth aN torture, It wes ps if
the reversal the figures had reversed the possibilities of succok|and
protectionAbd with the death of the Czar Liberator, the last chance of the
Armeniahs died.

The Turkish Massacres of 1875 and 1876 which led up to the Russo-
Turkish War of 1877 are historical facts too well known to need further
