earth as other nations? Does Humanity, does Christianity allow that tender
babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and butchered
before the eyes of their mothers, or that the ears of mothers should be reat
with the cries of the dying agony of their. murdered children? arg le
Humanity, does Christianity allow that helpless women sl orcibly
subjected to the most hideous, the most loathsome, st revolting, and
the most crueloutrages? Does Humanity, does CliNstianity, allow all this?

 ChristifyGavernments have organized a Hague Conference of Peace
and Civilization, Jut they have. closed its doors to the cause of a bleeding
christian radeefoaning under the yoke of the cruellest oppressors that the
world has yet known. Christian men and women have held up their hands
in horror at the Indian Juggernauth; but alas! the political wheels’ of
Christian Governments have been a Greater Juggernauth for a helpless

Christian Powers should be all gathered together, ong-against an nk /
Empire of your Oppressors, as eagles gather tog r pound a carcase ; C
really there is no help for it; and if you must d\¢_J}édeously by a_ hellish
extermination, why then you must die, and we have to condone your hellish
extermination, for in any case, each one of us must secure his own politica
and commercial interests in this same Kwpirg.ofyour-Oppressors.”
