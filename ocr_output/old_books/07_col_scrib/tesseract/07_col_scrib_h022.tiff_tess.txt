Gilbert W orton, of Bay View, Southold. It is doubly historic

with wheat ayAl buried, thus securing the wheat from the foraging
parties of The British army. It is made of solid oak—hoops and all—
the hoops are square and about an inch and a quarter thick—only one
hoop missing. It is used for a grain cask, and will hold about fifteen
bushels. It was formerly called ‘‘uncle Barney’s money barrel,” as
romance had it, that he brought it over full of gold and silver.

AENTONG Stee is still preserved. It is made of the Yew tree
wood, has a fine ivory head with the letters “J. H.’’ and the figures
‘*1617’’ in apparently golden specks indented into it, from which it |
would seem that it once belonged to his father, and that J. H. (Joseph
Horton) were his initials. It is now owned by Silas R. Horton, of
Goshen, N. Y.

any royal blood has ever coursed in their vef¥6—-Sr@ tesa always
have been, / s rather than consumers, and for industry, integ-
rity, ee will lose nothing in a comparison with the re-
nowned &mikey of either the new or the old world.

The first of the family who emigrated to this country, of whom we
have any authentic record, came over from England 1633 to 1638.
Thomas, Jeremiah, and Barnabas, were among the early emigrants,
and old tradition says they were brothers. “Thomas came over in the
