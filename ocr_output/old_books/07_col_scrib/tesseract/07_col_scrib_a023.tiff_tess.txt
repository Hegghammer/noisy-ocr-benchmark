orgy, except to call them fiends incarnate; and who is the bold man who

can guarantee that these same fiends incarnate have become metamorphosed

and changed all of a sudden; or that the handful of liberal Turks atGen-
stantinople are capable of controlling and restraining them. We og le
even heard that the leaders and participators of the lastapesSatres have
been punished as they deserved ; and what is the i? they are left un-
punished ? because the Government is afraid to puhish Mahommedans for
killing Chy6yang; because the liberal Turks dare not punish the “ true
believers ’{ for lYlling “ Kaffirs.”

The rétgfon of Mahommed, the religion of the sword, has been infused
into the Turk, and to understand the effect of the religion of Mahommed
upon the Turk, it is necessary to regard it from four aspects, or from four
points of analysis. First, the fundamental doctrine and law of the religion.
Second, ve character of the founder as an example to his followers. Third,
the racialand éthnographic characteristics of the Turk. Tourth, the effe
which this particular religion would be likely to have on this particular rzce.
When we have viewed the Turk and his government from these four ppints
of analysis, we have the explanation of all the woe and desolation which
have lain over the countries under Turkish rule.

between the two races, the oppressor and the oppressed. Thousands upon
thousands of Arnienian women, thousands upon thousands of Armenian
children, have been hounded to death, or savagely, ferociously, horribly and
loathsomely maltreated by the Turk, and yet in all the on foyhs when
Massacre has succeeded upon Massacre, has there been ond kfoyn gaseg
one single instance of a Turkish weman or child maltreated by Cri /

—The last massacres though especially org from the Pala :
Constantinople, were officially announced to un hate from an affray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed one of the threef
given equal numbers and arms, the Armenian is always a match far tlfe
Turk, but alas fpr him that unequal numbers and wane of arms have alWays
made him the Tm of his oppressor.

AhmedAika Bey in the first part (Ses Causes) of his book ‘ La Crise de
L’Orient ” “published in Paris in 1907 holds a brief for his nation which
through its own fallacious arguments falls to the ground. I will quote one
passage as an example.
