terrible stronghold of Kars," universally admitted to be one of the greatest
and most difficult military exploits ever achieved, and the crowning success

hard fate of their unhappy nation under Turkish rule, but that fate, hard
before, was made a hundredfold and even a thousandfold harder.

Commanded the Russian forces (n Asiatic Turkes
during the Russo-Turkish war and captured the im-

the Constitution that he was on the eve of granting to
his people were nituen Melikoff; but after the
death of Alexander II he was not allowed to continue in
his good work of reforming Russia, being overthrown
from office early in the reign of Alexander III.
