like a round bow, a great brown eye revealed the inward spirit's intelligence and zeal
quenched. On his head was a close-titting cap of purple velvet.
Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest men- Marditch
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people slonty
vg
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or " Miciduly -Begotten
is Descended.' From the window of a neighboring l'oom he night have looked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now askit close and huried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling suow and hurricane that hid the
cone of Ararot. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of eighty-seven years ago, Khrimian was born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land ; the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able
Powers or Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom-a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Near East. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos now looked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to last it had been inspired by one absorbing and unselfish aim-the freedom and
regeneration of his people. It is true he had failed.
From his carliest years, when lie had witnessed the terrors of Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality-pug
a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance the
prosperous and contented of the world. He began as a poet, wandering far and wide trough
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wife's death, he devoted himself to the building of schools,
which
he
generously threw over to Rurus the heledran of menians. For many
cars, while Europe was occupied with Crimcan wars, Austrian wars, or French and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying from Van to Constantinople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emblems of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Arnientan patriarch of Constantinople (1869), he was driven from
his office after four years.
But the cup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiless slaughter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. motives

done with success for the Lebanon. In London he became acquainted with Gladstone ; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises (i
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey's definite reforms. It is necdless to suy that toone of these promise and
pledges were obserfed Beaconsfield returned to London amid shouts of " Peace with Hopor

So
it
went Orr. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake
