then adjudged crimes de-
serving banishment which might be deemed
virtues in a moreenlightened age, and under free
institutions; for under the despotic colonial
governments of Spanish America in that age to
criticize the vices, or censure the lawless edicts
of a satrap, was a heinous offence, for which
transportation was but a mild punishment.
Originally, Spain's dominion was asserted
over the entire circle of the shores of the Gulf of
Mexico, as well as over all the islands which
n
they girdled. But upon the voyage of La Salle
from the tupper waters of the Mississippi to the
O
sea, France asserted a claim, under the name of
Louisiana, to the entire valley of the river from
its spring-heads to the Gulf, making to the exm
tent of the southern limit of her claim, from
east to west, a huge gap in Spain's North
American empire.
