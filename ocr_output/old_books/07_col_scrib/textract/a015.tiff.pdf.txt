DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE.
I have thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested witnesses.
" Weare having a perfectly hideous time here. Thousands have been murdered-
in this province they say ; but the number is probably greater, for every Christion village
was wiped out In Adana about 5000 have perished. After Armenians had

could get out. Everybody in the house was roasted alive. They were all women and
children and old people."-Extract from letter of Mrs. Doughty-Wylie, wife of British Conjul
