was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples which with sinecre and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engoscin
commerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few among them justly started an agitation these our noble
and industrions brethren were being massacred. What a kralter scene! When
we
left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our Timenian compatriots being
removed in manufectarts legs and arms were hanging down outside. This bloody scene will
ever remain impressed on my mind.

This shecking crime of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a cursed absolutism, up to the last moment, grew wider. Even during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feelings which had been shown,
the awful events in Adana took place and the souls of all true Osmanlis melted into tears.
Up to the present time the deep sorrow caused by this event has not disappeared, because this
bloody wound in our social body cannot easily be eured. While we fill our stomachs with
choice morsels, while we rest selfishly in our comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans, widows hungry, haked, and barefoot wander hither and thither, and thousands of
families are fleeing from the fatherland. We are convineed that the government is doing iss
work, but what has happened is so great a calamity that it ean keep a government bul for
years. However much sacrifice we may make, still it will be inadequate, becausd the
happiness of the fatherland depends on healing such blood wounds as these as soon as possible.
We are convineed that the government and all connected with it are persuaded of this as well as
ourselves. We must now wipe out the traces of the misfortune brought by a eursed period.
We must now comfort weeping those who do not
understand that patriotism and brotherhood de not differ from each other. The responsibility
of the government for the Armenians is very great and very weiglity. The whole Ottoman
nation is under obligations to protect this suffering race, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
in flarge part due to the blood shed by the Armenians. We thought that these truths
were so obvious that we proferred to keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary from time to time to recall the greatness of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yesterday has endured only barbarism, and for twelve years
has been constantly oppressed and ground to the earth, and has given thousamos of victimis.
Hereafter we must work to assure them that the era of massacres has passed, And with all our
strength of mind and soul we must quiet them. The obligation of the to protect
them is also very heavy, because our Armenian countrymen vo-among wandering tribes.
We must all assist the government and point out its obligation

This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare disclose
his identity ; andithe account given by an authority like Mr. James Bry
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as les Massacres occasionnès par les aventuriers Arméniens."
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
