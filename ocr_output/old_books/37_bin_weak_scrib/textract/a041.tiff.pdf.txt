like a round bow, a great brown ere revealed the inward spirit's intelligence and zeal
quenched. On his head was a close-titting cap of purple velvet.
Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people-clarly
vg
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or " The F-Begotten
is Descended." From the window of a neighboring loom he Night Tooked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the viues were now all close and huried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling suow and hurricane that hid the
conc of Ararol. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of eighty-seven years ago, Klirimian was born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able l'owers or Turope. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom-a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Near East. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos now looked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to last it had been inspired by one absorbing and unselfish aim-the freedom and
regeneration of bis people. It is true he had failed.
From his carliest years, when lie had witnes-ed the terrors of Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality-sug a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance amony the
prosperous and contented of the world. He began as a poet, wandering far and wide trough
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of Armenia, visiting Constautinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glories of their national historv.
Entering the monastic order after his wife's death, he devoted himself to the building of schools,
which he generously threw open to Kurk the heredban of Omenians. For many
cears, while Europe was occupied with Crimcan wars, Austrian wars, or French and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying from Van to Constantinople and through
the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emblems of the Host bung in mockery round the necks
of
dogs. When patriarch of Constantinople (1869), he was driven from
his office after four years.
But the cup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiless staugliter of Bulgaians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. th/varled motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Abrim
himself summoned to plead his people's cause before the Congress of Berlin. Thougi he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited

done with success for the Lebanon. In London he became acquainted with Gladstone; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially Emgland, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey's definite reforms. It is neculess to SHIV that toone of these promise and
pledges were observed Beaconsfield returned to Londou amid shouts of " Peace with Honor

rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last inculculable
