PREFACE
from Smith, who himself was prone to include
the most extraragunt myths in his pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE LINES AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAMOUS
HIGHWAYMEN Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the "truth" of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less suid the better.
No one hus ever reprinied those wuthors in
their or their grossness.
It would be impossible; und, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
them, or even written (In independent history of
the highwaymen. IVhen we consider how astonish-
ingly popular those romances have ever been
which have had Claude Du Vall, and Turpin,
and their like for heroes, this is not a little
surprising.
Perhups the task has been ubandoned because
of the difficulty-the almost insuperable difficulty
N.
-of sifting fact from fiction, und becanse of "
chilling sense that it would be (< thankless task
to present the highwayman as he really was : a
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No nould
be likely to phank the frank historian for this dis-
service andf do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
