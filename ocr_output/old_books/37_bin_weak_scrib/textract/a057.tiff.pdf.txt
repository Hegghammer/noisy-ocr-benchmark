Chureh, but was also a fearles patriot-a distinguished linguist, an eloquent preacher, and a
thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the feared fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudeuce to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the anuals of Armenian history.
ating
At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thummerstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrivo from Constantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nercès, the Patriareh, their object being to request the signatory l'owers of
the Berlin Treaty force it guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.
Abdul HIhmid and his advisers were furious at this affront, and Monseigneur Nercès was
summoned to Ne Palace. It is said that when he received the summons be simply smiled
and asked one of of his curates to read the Burial Service to him, as he diel not expect to
return alive. However, he went. No one has ever heard what passed between the Sultan
and himself at the interview suffice it to say that he immediately summoned the Armenian
General Assembly and tendered his resignation. This was not accepted by the Assembly,
and, amidst enthusiastic cheers, he was carried back to his apartments at the Patriarchate.
der reached him, sigued by the Sultan, to recall the Armenian
delegation from Berlin. This Monseigneur Varjabétian point-blank refused to do, and retired
to his private residence at Haskeuy, it village on the Golden Horn. The success of thepdele-
gation, however, did not come up to his expectations. The Armenians, as it happened, could
not be heard, but they were so far successful as to have an article inserted in the treaty.
The Sultan and his advisers never forgave the Patriareli this, though they could not
openly do anything to him on account of his enormons popularity. Time passed on, and to
all appearance the incident was forgotton but One afternoon a most
cordial invitation was sent by a very higli dignitary of the Palace, requesting the Archbishop
to dine with him informally. An invitation of this kind could not very well be refused, SO
the Archbishop, accompanied only by a body-servant named Vartan, repaired to the Pasha's
house The Pasha received him at the door and escorted the visitor with much ceremony and
extreme courtesy to a private of the salamlik of his house (the men's quarters),
where dinmer was served. The geniality displayed by his host dispelled any fears that the
Archbishop might have had as to his personal safety.
After dinner, as usual, coffée was served. Now, this serving of the entlige is rather
a
ceremonial according to high Turkish etiquette, and it is not unusal for gucets to bring their
own tchooboutder (the servant who carries his master's pipe and pouch and also
the making of his coffee). The Archbishop was presented with tehoobouk (pfpe) thed
and lighted for smoking, and a servant followed with coffee. Archbishop accepted bruth

servant Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, in a voice trembling with emotion, Monseigneur,

This was enough for the Archbishop ; he pretended to he startled and spilt the coffée, but,

master. Concernité Vartan's whereabouts or his ultimate end nothing was ever made
-the poor fellow simply vanished. Monseigneur Varjabétian, after a short interval thanked
the Pasha for his generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily summoned. The Patriarch took to his bed,
and lost all his hair through the effects of the poison. Then, one morning, when a servant
