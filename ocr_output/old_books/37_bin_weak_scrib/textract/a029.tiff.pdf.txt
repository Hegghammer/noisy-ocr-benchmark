PART I.
THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN.
ating
Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1STS, and the signing of the Shumore famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel in histpry.
In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1S7S. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of Europe,
but in the interests of Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood)
It was a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of "the
terrible stronghold of Kars,' universally admitted to be one of the greatest
and most difficult military exploits ever achieved, and the crowning sudgess
of the Russian arms in Asiatic Turkey, should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General; that although Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest Amenize soldiers, fought conquered and
died, yet by these successes not only was no amelioration attained of the
kard fate of their unhappy nation under Turkish rule, but that fate, hard
before, was made a hundredfold and even a thousandfold harder.
GENERAL FRINCE LOHIS MELIKOTF
Commanded the Russian forces In Asiatic Turkes
during the Russo-Turkisk war and captured the im-
