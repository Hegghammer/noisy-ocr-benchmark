Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
Turkish rule? To this question, we must answer an emphatic No!
The causes that must operate against any change are many and deep-
ideas (or it may be French polished) at Constantinople, are goingado thange
seated. In the first place it cannot be expected that a few Turks of Hoging
the thought and character of the nation. The paractefistics of a people
change very slowly, if they ever change at all, andithe predominant national
traits of the many-blooded modern Turk have been shown to the world to
be, cruelt/i and fanaticism, combined with a fierce sensuality ; and what is
more than all, and which has to be remembered most, is, that they are a
people accustomed to the unbridled gratification of their worst passions.
The ethnographic traits of the Turkman which history bears out, are
wildness and fierceness, and it would not be incorrect to argue that with the
instincts of his primitive ancestors have been assimilated the many cross
currentendation in his veins, into all of which has been infused the
doctrines of the religion of the sword, a religion which does not make for
the peace or well being of mankind ; a religion, also, which assigning one of
the two sexes to the degraded position of being created solely for the /gross
pleasure of the other, does not make for the exaltation of mankind.
To quote again the eminent authority previously referred to : "No
Mahommedan race or has to govern well
even subjects of its own religion, while to extend equal rights to subjects of
a different creed is forbidden by the very law of its being."
Not the Jewish conceit proclaiming itself God's elect and chosen, and
originating the name Theathen which it scorned. Not the Christian conceit
emanating from the Jewish source, and laying the flattering unction to its
soul of superiority over the "heathen' of its own time. Not hejunbending
caste exclusiveness of the Brahman across whose path even the shador of
the despised Sudra falling would be deemed defilement. Notany of these,
can equal the intolerant religious pride of the Mahommedan, or reach the
/
pinnacle of-religious self-sufficiency on which he has/seated hinself. To be
a Mahommedan, is enough-Cell suffit.
To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans, and
intimate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahommedan is above all things a Mahommedan
religion is the paramount question in his life, and remains its predominating
if
His
feature abore everything else. This should not be surprising, since to the
" faithful Paradise is secured, and all crimes and transgressions against
"unbelievers' absolved.
