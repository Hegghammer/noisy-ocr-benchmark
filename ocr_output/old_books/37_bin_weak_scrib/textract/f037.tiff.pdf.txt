as the town was named, i.e. the "hill-staple' "
or market, and his successors were often there
The wool market was the most important at
Parcine
Dunstable the monks long maintaining great
flocks of sheet on the adjacent downs.
The robbers became only a memory, but a
memory that never faded. It merely took on
another form, and in the course of time the name
of the town itself was twisted into an allusion
to them and to their leader. It needed the col-
lusion of gross ignorance and wild legend to effect
so much, but the thing was done; and for cen-
turies Dunstable was, and perhaps even now is,
locally said to owe its name to "Dun's Stable,"
a hollow in the chalk downs. pointed out as having
been the place where "Dun," the entirely ima-
ginary leader of the outlaws, stabled his horse.
If you doubt this there is the town seal to con-
vince the sceptical, showing as it does what is
said to be a horseshoe (a shoe of Dun's horse!),
but is really intended for a staple or hasp.
The legendary Dun was a kind of bogey to
N.
the children of the neighbourhood, and in John-
son's pages is a most bloodthirsty creaturg.
There we read that his first exploit was on the
highway to Bedford, where he met a waggon full
of corn, going to market, drawn by a fine team
of horses. He accosted the waggoner, and in the
midst of conversation stabbed him to the heart
with a dagger. He buried the body, and drove the
waggon off to the town, where he sold the corn
and the waggon as well, and then disappeared !
