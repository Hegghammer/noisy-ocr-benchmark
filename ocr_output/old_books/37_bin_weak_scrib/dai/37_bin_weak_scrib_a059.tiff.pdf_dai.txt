Scene
A book has been written and published in Japan, its title "Niku Dan
translated into English, reads, Human Bullets.' This little book, a
narrative of the siege of Port Arthur, after being read through the length
and breadth of the empire, found translators to translate it into the best
known of languages; and its young author, himself an actor in the siege,
was summoned to the presence of his sovereign to be thanked and praised.
The book is a graphic narrative of the most terrible siege in history, wherein
is vividly portrayed the deadly struggle of the besiegers. It contains as an
acknowledgement of its merit, a page on which is recorded the Field
Marshal's appreciation, and another page bearing the Commanding General's -
commendation.
In simple narrative the author carries the reader through appalling
scenes of horror, and as we read we are made to realize the slaughter of
the enemy's machine guns, of their ground-mines, electric-wire entangle-
ments, and exploding shells; we are made to hear the roar of the artillery
fire dealing death and destruction, and there rises before us the mental vision
of the fierce hand to hand conflict, and the dead and dying lying thickly in
the dark ravine.
"For hill and battle plain,
With dying men and slain,
Grew mountain heights of pain
And mine is boundless woe."
The grim warrior who stormed and took the most impregnable fortress
in the world gives expression to his feelings on his own great achievement,
in saddest words,
And mine is boundless woe,"
For the grim warrior's heart is cleft in twain for the human bullets that
under his command hurled themselves to their death.
