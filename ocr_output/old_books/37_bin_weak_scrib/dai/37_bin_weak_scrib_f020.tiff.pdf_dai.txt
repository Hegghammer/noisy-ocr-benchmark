HALF-HOURS WITH THE HIGHWAYMEN

violently abused, threatened, and robbed, did not
observe that atmosphere of romance about the
highwaymen, with which, not only modern times,
but their own age, enwrapped them. The high-
waymen have ever been accounted romantic, as
we shall see in these ensuing pages; from the
more or less mythical Robin Hood, down to the
Carolean age of Captain Hind, Swiftnicks, and
Du Vall, whose exploits were followed with
interest and sympathy by their contemporaries.
From a lengthy study of these things, one fact
rises prominently above all others it is the fact
that the highwayman's only ceased to be a
romantic figure when he stopped and robbed one's
self, under the usual cireumstances of coarsen
vituperation and personal indignity. On all other
occasions, although he commonly practised after
nightfall, he paradoxically moved in a rosy atmo-
sphere, in company with the knightly figures of
ancient chivalry (who themselves, if the truth of
it were told, would probably be disclosed as a
rather sordid crew).
The thrilling romance-or the side-splitting
humorous circumstances, as the case might be
of one's acquaintance or next-door neighbour
being plundered, threatened with death at the
pistol-muzzle, and then, with his very coat
stripped off his back, being bidden make haste
away, is obvious enough, and the highwayman
who did all the threatening and the plundering
is easily seen to be at once a hero and a humorist;
but when he met yourself in the darkling lane,
