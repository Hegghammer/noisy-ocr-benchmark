No one doubts that a great forward movement is reaching its culminat-
ing point in the destiny of Asia. The West has learnt its all of religion (the
moral and guiding principle of mankind) from the East, and now the Fast
would fain learn the law of restraint and the law of freedom (the pro line
principles of mankind) from the West. Inspired by this feeljng-tte liberal
Turks decidedly mean well, and they are animated % sincere desire to
ensure peace and security of life and property for théSheterogeneous peoples
under the ‘Yfash sway, but they themselves have had to contend and still
have to Sofi a fanatical populace.

To the ommedan world at large the Caliph of Islam is the envoy of
God, the sacredness of whose person must be inviolate. Abdul Hamid, the
astute politician, knew that the security of his sovereignty depended on his
Caliphal rights, and his main policy during the long period of his execrable
reign had been directed towards preserving and asserting the same; thus
we can’ Seehow Ms det hronement, which the liberal Turks would gladly have
accomplished simultaneously with the inauguration of the core
to be deferred to a later period, and how it was necessary for the She\/ul
Islam to pronounce the Caliph a traitor to his sacred trust, a violator of ‘the
holy law of the Prophet, before his dethronement could be dared or
accomplished. i.

The Christian Armenians in Turkey live in the midst of the followers

fea os religion, with no power or force behind them which makes for

ction. Who does not know that the great numerical preponderance of

Hinduism keeps the balaaceof power in India, and restrains bloody religious
hostilities; and when we review the whole religious history of Christian
Europe, and that terribly long roll of crimes committed in the name of } lim
who expounded I lis religion with the parable of the Good Saftgritan, and
the precept of loving one’s neighbour as one’s self, we cannot ee,
the fanatical outbursts of the followers of Mahomared, the forfnder of a /
religion, whose doctrines certainly fall short of 9 humane principtes -
inculcated by the Founder of Christianity. If authdatioAhistorical facts prove
to us that horrible and atrocious cruelties have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other religionists, but on fellow Christians of different
denominations, how then can we expechbettarthingsrom the Turk unjes
some power or force-sestrain him ?

Cia hs vow partly emancipated herself from the ferocitie
which darkeéed fd poured the red stream of blcod on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at large, religion is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite.
