PART IL
THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN. nt

Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe tANE famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the s e famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armeniad nation stands without
its parallel jf history.

In thd Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of Europe,
but in the interests of Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blogd),

It was a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of “th
terrible stronghold of Kars,” universally admitted to be one of the greAt¢st
and most difficult military exploits ever achieved, and the crowning sudgess

| of the Russian arms in Asiatic ‘Turkey, should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General; that although Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquestrandApveniav-soldiers Rugbe conquered and
KE , yet by these successes not only was no amelioration attained of the
Ard fate of their unhappy nation under Turkish rule, but that fate, hard
re, was made a hundredfold and even a thousandfold harder.
