Further in answer to Ahmed Riza Bey’s account of the Armenian
“prétendus patriotards ”’ in connection with the Ottoman Bank ; I cannot do
better than quote from Mr. Bryce’s version of the story, and the massaetg x
that followed: ‘In the following June serious trouble arose at Vancatire
some sort of insurrection is said to have been planned thoyeadrt the discre-
pancy of the accounts it is hard to arrive at the trMef~ “Masses of Kurds
came down theeatening to massacre the Christians, and a conflict in which
many inno Parsons perished, was with difficulty brought to an end by
the interveption gf the British Consul. A little later the Armenian revolu-
tionary party-€mboldened by the rising in Crete, where the Christians, being
well armed and outnumbering the Muslims, held their ground successfully,
issued appeals to the Embassies and to the Turkish Government to introduce
reforms, threatening disturbances if the policy of repression and massacre
was persistecdin. ‘These threats were repeated in August, and ultimately,
on Austist 36, a band of about twenty Armenians, belonging the revolutionary
party, made a sudden attack on the Imperial Ottoman Bank in Constzh-

whom had recently been brought to the city—together with the lowest
Turkish class. Using the occasion, they launched this mob upon the peace-
ul Armenian population. The onslaught began in various parts of the city so
soon after the attack on the Bank that it had obviously been prearranged,
and the precaution had been taken to employ the Turkish ruffans in different
quarters from those in which they dwelt: so that they might asily be
recognised. Carts had moreover been prepared in which é be:
