PREFACE ix
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions - 4
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific niger
; torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and cele ye villuins, for whom of old no
mud twa: thick and slab. Beliefs are being
assailed on every side. Yo abolish the traditional
, courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the considerate
conduct of Captain Hind would, therefore, be
strokes of Me tnkindest, and I have here attempted
no such iconoclusm, Even where I cannot be-
lieve, I have told the tale—iwhenever it has been
| worth the telling—as it is found in criminal
trials, or in Smith op lolnsonn~gnd phon
sources, decorously stripped of much vile language.
Tur really, where mutch that seems incredible
may be fully proned—and where the believable
turns out not rarely to be fulse, ’tis your only way.
To continue the story of the highwaymen from
Smith and Johnson down to the upprouching end ())
of all such things in the beginning of the nime-
teenth céntury, is like taking up and conctkiy)
a half-told tale. But tt was worth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpin has
always made, has it been found really necessary
to serionaly foie and re-state the cureer of
that much-overrated scoundrel, and to put him
in his proper place: «a very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
