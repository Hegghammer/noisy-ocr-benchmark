THE kRanws LAST VOYAGE

I mean those in the staterooms. I cannot

speak with certainty in regard to the port-

holes on deck E. I believe that the first list

the ship tok brought her down to these

open ports on the starboard side and that

she sank much more quickly from filling

could be done on the port side—for there was

no discipline or order with which to do it—I

passed through to the starboard side. Men

were striving to lower the boats and were

putting women and children into them, but it

seemed to-mre that it only added horror to O
the whole situation to put people into a

boat that you knew never would be cleared

and which would go down with the steamef}~—"—-"~" ~
better leave Op on the deck to let them

take their ch4nteat a piece of wreckage.
