half a century; making in all two hundred and thirteen years at the :
death of Jonathan G. Horton, 3 July, 1873. These six genepations a
all living and dying in the old mansion! Could those old har
echo all the words ever spoken there, and exhibit anew all the scenes
ever witnesy sre—the book containing such a record would vastly
exceed in fons the size of the old castle. Tt would bring to light
much that S=w6w in darkness, and must forever remain hidden from
the generations of the living.

At the death of Jonathan G. Horton, the old homestead became,
by will, the property of the Rev. Mrs. Williams, of Brooklyn, N. Y.,
who was the adopted daughter of Jonathan G. Horton, he never

went out of the Horton name.

Mrs. Williams proposes to sell it, and if some of the Hortons do
not buy it, it will indicate a lack of decent respect for the old castle,

| if not for the Horton name. It should be bought back into the

Horton name, suitably repaired and preserved for the wonder and
admiration of generations of-hlartensrypetmborn Jonatban-G-
