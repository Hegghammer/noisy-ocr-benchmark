Remember that they know not what they do
Who strike-imdeadlyfear and ghastly hate;
Remember that somehow, and at some time,
Each crime exacts its human penalty.
| Remember that man’s conscience and man’s mind
Are agents of Thy purpose and Thy plan,
Which work within a deadlier revenge
P= any shrapnel shot or sabre thrust.
Remember that new generations come
Upon whom fall the burden and the curse,
The anguish of old hatreds and past wrongs,
The crushing debt, the struggle and despair.
Restrain, O God, the sweep of this vast hate;
Recaltthe nations to their sense of shame: O
To those in blinding war, to us at peace,
Reveal anew the message of the Christ.
