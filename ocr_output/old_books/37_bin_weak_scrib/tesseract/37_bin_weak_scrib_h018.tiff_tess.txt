Vi Preface.—Ilntroduction.

It is said that Barnabas Horton I. was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities.

His tombstone is of lenglish blue marble, five feet long and about Tmo

three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. Menor
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Hdrton.
It is clevatedstigut eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. ‘Th (Fe base was of brick, but it had all crumbled down
mnany “n(eae) The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Horton.

The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads as
follows:

“Were lieth buried the body of Mr. BARNABAS Horrox, who was born at
Mousel DCO IS ST England, and died at Southold, on the 13th day of
July, 1680, aged So years.”

In the centre of the stone we find the Mpitaph, as follows :

| “Here lies my body tombed in dust .
Till Christ shall come to raise it with the just;
My soul ascend Te tHe Trane OC,
T Where with sweet Jesus now | make abode:
Then hasten after me, my dearest wife,
To be partaker of this blessed life ;
And you, dear children, all follow the Lord,
Hear and obey His public sacred word ;
And in your houses call upon [is name,
For oft | have advised you to the same:
Then God will bless you with your children all,
And to this blessed place He will you call.” (])
Heb, xi: 4.—* He being dead, yet speaketh.” O

It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the griginal
thirteen who bropght_his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a comypefidable desire to sce that his name and memory
should not pyfisk_fpom the earth.
