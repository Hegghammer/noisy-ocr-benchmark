CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. ?
an opposite theory, in which instinctive agency is rejected, and the appearances arc explained from
a consideration of the necessities and voluntary exertions of the animal. With regard to the
observer, it has been asserted, that it is by experience alone that he distinguishes the signs of the
passions ; that we learn, while infants, to consider smiles as expressions of kindness, because they
are accompanied by acts of beneficence and by endearments ; and frowns as the contrary, because
we find them followed by blows ; that the expression of anger in a brute, is only that which has
been observed to precede his biting ; and that of fondness, his fawning and licking of the hand.
With regard to the creature itself, it is said, what has heen called the external signs of passion, are
mercly the concomitants of those voluutary movements, which the passions or habits suggest ; that

‘the glare of the Lion’s eye, for example, is the consequence of a voluntary exertion to see his prey
more clearly —his grin, or snarl, the natural motion of uncasing his fangs before he uses them.
This, however, is not quite true of all animals and of all expression of passion.”

“Attending merely to the evidence furnished by anatomical investigation, hat I shall
venture to affirm is this: that a remarkable difference is to be afemet GF onony and
range of expression, in man and in animals: that in the, f ‘ ere seems to be a systematic
provision for that mode of communication nde cw which is to be read in the
changes, ountenauce: that there is 10 emotion in the mind of man which has not its
appropriate sigys ; and that there are even muscles in the human face to which no other use can be
assigne: to serve as the organs of this language: that, on the other hand, there is in the lower
animals no range of expression which is not fairly referable as a mere accessary to the voluntary
or needful actions of the animal; and that this accessary expression does not appear to be in any

“There appears to me (continues Mr. BELL) to be no expressio# if the face of any animal
lower in the scale of being than quadrupeds; and in them the \frongest and most marked

| expression is that of rage; the object of which is opposition, resistance, aud defence. But on
examination it pil-he found_(pepaistontlantr Ac postiointhetthis is merely an accessary of
the motions natural to the accomplishment of the object which the animal has in view) that the
strength of the expression is in exact proportion to the strength of the principal action in the

“The gramnivorous animals, which seek their subsisteyee, nat by preying upon others, nor by
