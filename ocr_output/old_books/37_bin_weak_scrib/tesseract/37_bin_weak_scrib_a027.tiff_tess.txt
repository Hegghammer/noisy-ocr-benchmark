was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples which with sinecre and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engy in
commerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase theguahe of
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few among them justly started an agitatigr sé our noble
and industrious brethren were being massacred. What a (éyabt@ scene! When we
left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of oar &¥menian compatriots being
removed in man arts ; legs and arms were hanging down outside. ‘This bloody seeue will
ever remain inpyssQ on my mind.

«This eye of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of Cursed absolutism, up to the Inst moment, grew wider. Even during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feelings which had been shown,
the awful events in Adana took phice and the souls of all true Osmaulis melted into tears.
Up to the present time the deep sorrow caused by this event has not disappeared, heexuse this
bloody wound in our social body cannot easily be cured. While we fill our stomachs with
choice morsels, while we rest selfishly in our comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans Wayeehanere Ne ker, and barefoot wander hither and thither, and thousands of
families are fleeing from the fatherland. We are convinced that the government is doing YS
work, but what has happened is so great a calamity that i¢ can keep a government bufy Aor
years. Ifowever much sacrifice we may make, still it will be inadequate, becausd/the
happiness of the fatherland depends on healing such blood wounds as these as soon as possible.
We are convinced that the government and all connected with it are persuaded of this as well as
ourselves. We must now wipe out the traces of the misfortune brought by a eursed period.
We must now comfort weeping rentha Ae umsirundosstendnudumiehcthose who do not

ofthe government for the Armenians is very great and very weighty. The whole Ottoman
iation is under obligations to proteet this suffering race, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
fitarge part due to the blood shed by the Armenians. We thought that these truths
were so obvious that we peoferredto keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary from time to time to recall the greatness of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yesterday has endured only barbarism, aud for twelve years
has been constantly oppressed and ground to the earth, and has given thousggts of victims.
Hereafter we must work to assure them that the cra of massacres has passed, Ang wifh all
strength of mind and soul we must quiet them. ‘The obligation of the govdraipey Tro tye
