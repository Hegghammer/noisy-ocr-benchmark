DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE.
Thave thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested witnesses.
“Weare having a perfectly hideous time here. ‘Lhousands have been murdered—¥ Sai
in this province they say ; but the number is probably greater, for every Christy lave
was wiped out In Adana about 5000 have perished. After Tprks rmenians had
made peace, the Turks came in the night with hose and kerosene. afeset fire to what remained
ofthe Armenian quagter. Next day the French and Armenian school’ were fired. Nearly every-
one in the Armefipeschool perished, anybody trying to eseape being shot down by thesoldiers.”
“The Turlish Auphorities do nothing except arrest unoffending Armenians, from whom
by torture theylextortAhe most fanciful confessions. Even the wounded are not safe from
their injustice. San was being carried in to me yesterday when he was seized and taken
off to gaol. I dare not think what his fate may be.
‘Por fiends inearnate commend me to the ‘Turks. Nobody is safe from them. They
murder babies in front of their mothers ; they half murder men, and violate the wives while
the husbands are lying there dying in pools of blood.”
“The authorities did pothing, and the soldiers were worse than the crowd, for they were
better armed. “One Touse nf our quarter was burned with 115 people inside. We counted
the bodies. The soldiers set fire to the door, and as the windows had iron bars, nobody
could get out. Everybody in the house was roasted alive. They were all women fu
children and old people.”—Extraet from letter of Mrs. Doughty-Wylic, wife of British Congul
he Adana; published in the London ‘ Daily Mail.”

IN THIS BOWSE 115 WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ROASTED ALIVE.
llistory repeats rtself. In 1895 Turkish soldiers fell upon seventy to eighty young
women and girls in a church, where they had fled for refuge, and after hidcously outraging
them, barricaded them in, setting fire to the building at the same time, and derisively shouting
to their victims as they were being roasted alive, to call upon their Christ to save them now
