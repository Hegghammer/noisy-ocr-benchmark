FOREWORD
| Woodworking shops in manual training schools far outnumber
those for other manual activities, and as a result, courses in wood-
work have come to be termed the stable courses in a handwork
curriculum. However, experience in woodwork’ alone is not suk

produces very definite reactions upon boys who could not be reached
by woodwork alone, awakening them to a new interest in their
work and making them more workmanlike and exacting in con-

correlation with wood will prove the truth of these statements and
demonstrate that they are not only worth while, but necessary to
any well-rounded course in wood.
