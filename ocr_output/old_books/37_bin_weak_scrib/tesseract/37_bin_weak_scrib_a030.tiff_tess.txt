The efforts of the Armenians, and the entreaties of their Patriarch
Nerses had procured the insertion of Article 16 in the Treaty of San
Stefano signed between Russia and Yurkey in March 1878. In nie
wording of the Article had been suggested by the Faint, iste I
provided the following stipulation for the protectiog of th enians :-—

‘ As the evacuation by the Russian troops re territory which they
now occupy-m Armenia, and which is to be restored to Turkey, might give
rise to CB and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good
relation, betyeen the two countrics, the Sublime Porte engages to carry into
effect without further delay the improvements and reforms demanded by
local requirements in the provinces inhabited by the Armenians, and to
guarantee their security against the Kurds and Circassians.”

What followed has passed into history. ‘The British Government of
whielnLetch Beaconsfield (then Mr. D’Isracli) was Premier, and Lord Salis-
bury Foreign Secretary, once more pursued the old policy of baffling Russian
agerandizement in Turkey. Afraid that her own real or fancied ees
would thereby become imperilled, England threw in the weight of henpower,

| and virtually conimanded the substitution of the Treaty of Berlin in lieu of
the Treaty of San Stefano. Thus the substantial guarantee of a natural and
immediate protector, bodtvable anddasireumof cnloxcingibe protection which
the Armenians then had in Russia, was taken away, and the security of im-
ST sve words given in its stead, namely :—

“ The Sublime Porte undertakes to carry out without further delay the
improvements ard-reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces
inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the
Circassians and Kurds. It will periodically make known the-steps taken to
this effect to the Powers, who will superintend their applicafigh.”

“Tt will periodically make knowin the steps taken by Tepe, /
Powers, who will superintend their applicatig¢tZ~ How this last Grovise |
could furrtst food for laughter were it not for (Opmnbi tragedy involved
in it.

The insertion of Article 61 in the Treaty of Berlin, granted, or rater
scemingly granted, by the six Powers of Europe, proved in reality, as Pub-
sequent events bore out, an instrumenteor Ten ard torture, It wes hs if

The Turkish Massacres of 1875 and 1876 which led up to the Russo-
Turkish War of 1877 are historical facts too well known to need further
