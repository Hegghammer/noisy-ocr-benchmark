and genealogy of the early settlers of Southold—examining all the deeds and zwi/s,
and other authentic documents to be found, and also copying the inscriptions from
every headstone, not only in Southold, but over nearly the whole Island—makes it
very evident that some of those named were not there at so early a date, and he ° yw
also says that Peter Hallock, who is named as one of the thirteen, was the grandsor
of the Puritan Hallock who settled at Southold, and whose Christian name was
William. Mr. Moore is one of the best genealogists of the country, and in relation
to Long Tsland, he ( authority extant.
MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE.

It will be seen by the engraving that the old house is double. The
western part is that which was built by Barnabas in 1659-60. ‘lhe
east or two-ssonLpuAwachuut by Jonathan L., about 1682. The upper
room of this part was used for a court-house for nearly twenty years,
as we learn from Thompson’s History of Long Island, and some of
the old benches used when it was a court-house are still preserved.
The old ‘castle,’ as Jonathan G. Horton, its last Horton occupant,
used to call it, is in all probability the oldest wood house in America,
I know of no dwelling-house of any kind, stong or brick, now stands
ing,that can date back as far as this venerable old mansion. ‘There
wept a few huts on the east of Long Island previous to 1640—two or
tree it is said on Shelter Island. But these, as well as those built by
the Puritans, immediately on_their settlement in Southold, soon all
passed away. Not a vestige of any of the first generation buildings
can be found except this one. It remained for the house that Barnabas
built to survive the wreck of ages, and to stand to-day as a noble :
representative of the dwellings of two hundred and fifteen years ago. (])
But the old house stands to-day not only as peering above all others (
by its age, but also by its occupancy. It is not very often that a
two generations of thé same name, living and dying in the same hose
rarely find three. But here we have six generations in succession, all
bearing the Horton name, living and dying in the same house, and
all born in it except Barnabas I., and his son Jonathan. We may go
to the castles and palaces of the old world, and sea th TORRE AES
gently, and fail to find[eparallel case.

With a few repaip fhe old castle may yet stand for generations far
in the future. .

It requires some thought and reflection to realize the lapse of time
since the old house was built. See the old Puritan himself there
twenty years; then his son Jonathan, twenty-eight years ; and then
Jonathan, Jr., about sixty years; and next Lawrence and és son Jona-
