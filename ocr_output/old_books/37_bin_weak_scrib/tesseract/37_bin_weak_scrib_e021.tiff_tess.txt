THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE. 13
Investigation proves to us that the taste for oe iled
even more in the Eastern nations than in those of E e, and we find
that other pareans besides that of compression have been extensively
taken ssa of. Humboldt, in his personal narrative, describes the
women oK Jas, and informs us that the reddish clay called “ampo” is
