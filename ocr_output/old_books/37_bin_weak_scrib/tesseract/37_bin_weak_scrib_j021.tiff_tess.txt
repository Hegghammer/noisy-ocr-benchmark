CANING SUGGESTIONS 17

holes are bored and ‘utilized in the cane weaving. ‘These are not
absolutely necessary; in fact caned areas on many pieces of period
and modern furniture do not utilize corner holes. In such instances
two diagonal strands are run in each hole on either side of the
| corner. A comparison of the areas, the one employing a corner
hole, and the other not, will lead the observer to conclude that the

former appears complete while the latcer appears unfinished.

in which a groove % in. deep and 3% in. wide has been run. “This
groove may be made with saw, chisel, or combination plane. Fig. 8
shows a sketch of such a strip. It makes a neat, pleasing cover.
Many pieces of so-Called expensive furniture have ragged, exposed

sary that the frame be stained before caning is begun. Box fuming
will not permanently color cane. Oil stains make no appreciable
impression if rubbed off at once. But water, acid, and alcoho}
stains produce decided col@ry—If the worker desires to color the
cane approximately the ae ane as the article, the caning may
be done on the white ood and the entire article stained at the one

as desired.
