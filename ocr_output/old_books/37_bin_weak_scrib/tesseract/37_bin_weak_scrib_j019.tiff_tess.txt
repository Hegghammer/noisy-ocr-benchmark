CANING SUGGESTIONS
As weaving progresses difficulty will be experienced in inserting ~~
ends in the holes, due to their becoming filled. Force the
fea awl thro and turn it several times. “This will effectively
Orce an opening. .

In many instances long ends of cane_remain from one series to
another. “These generally, as previously mentioned, should be used
in succeeding steps. There ts one limitation. “They should he
used provided it is not necessary to carry them over more than four
holes on the under side of the frame. “he fewer loose ends left,
the better, for the caning is thereby neater and hetter. It is gener-
ally advisable to use a full length strand to avoid a number of
loose ends.

The artatéur witHfind his greatest difficulty in properly weaving
the diagonals at the edges; that is, immediately upon entering or
leaving a hole. \Tany commendable pieces of caning are spoiled
by ragged, improperly woven edges. Care must be taken to see
that the cane goes over and under the proper strand or strands at
these points. Fig. 6 clearly shows how the diagonals should rut“
Study it carefully.

‘The addition of a bing nenerals a matter of taste. Perhaps
50 per cent of mode d caned furniture docs not employ a
binder of any description. The series of regularly exposed holes
are rather pleasing and in no way detract. However, in chair seats
a binder is essential ta protect the ends of canes, for they are subject
to hard wear.

Binders of reed or of wood called ‘‘splines” may be used on hand-
caned frames. 1f either is used a groove % in. deep and 3/16 in.
