THE ZONE
Avert Thy gaze, O God, close tight Thine eyes!
Glapes daxxn no longer on the ocean foam,
Lest Thou behold such horrors as can turn
Men’s burning hearts to ice, and chill their souls.
| Keep Thine heart warm and full of charity
That Thou mayst yet be able to forgive,
And pity feel for those who’kKnot fot When ee
T_ To pause in deeds of ruthless sacrifice.
Restrain Thy wrath, and keep Thine hand in
check;
Smite not, nor fiercely thrust without the pale
Those who can dare to strew the ocean waste
With fellow creatures, innocent of wrong.
Ferget the.studied purpose to destroy; O
The launching of the missile through the deep;
The shattered hull; the crushed and bleeding forms;
The seething swirl of wreckage, women, men.
OOOO OS
