charred timbers heaped on every side. Whit must it mean to the five thousand men and
women and lite children who have survived a painful flight to the seacoast and hay ow

“Can you part®ine the feelings of the Kessab people as they climbed on foot the lung trail
up the mountoyfnAtndthen as they came over the ridge into full view of their charred and
ruined dwellidgs ? ‘Yheir stores of wheat, barley and rice had been burned ; clothing, cooking
utensils, fiurniazesfid tools had gone; their goats, cows and mules had been stolen; theiv silk
industries stamped out ; their beloved churches reduced to smouldering heaps. ‘The budies of

12,000 souls in and around Zeitoon are dying of hunger ; they are wandering
about in rays, mixing bran and water, and cooking and eating it, if they can
get even that. Rev. Macnlhyarauds “rhe SAine Story comes to us from alli

of homelessness and_staryation will exceed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerated. JLast year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.

escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered if a/nig|ratt
by armed Kurds, and the villagers are now reduced to eme distréss. Before /
