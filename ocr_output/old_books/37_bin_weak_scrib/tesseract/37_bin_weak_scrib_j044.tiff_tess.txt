erally fit the pliable spline, allow it to dry, and then insert it wich
the webbing. This assures tight joints. This procedure is not

steps, but as with the Seven Steps in Caning, it should be used in
demonstrating the processes to classes. It materialhcasitvimmaei Uw
ing the processes clear to the students, previous to allowing work
of their projects, and assures a general understanding, at least, of
Poses procedure. The different panels are lettered for convenience
and need no elaborate explanation:

4 is the open frame with grooxes eet for the webbing.

B is the webbing inserted with ragged edges exposed, ready for
cutting.

C is the webbing with edges properly trimmed and a spline in-
serted,

D is the completed panel.

Inserts of cane webbing may be utilized on pieces of furniture
other than_seats. â€˜These inserts could be used on every article illus-
trated in Chapters T and II, with similar pleasing effects, and with
less labor. However, there is an obvious element in hand caning
which naturally and logically gives it precedence over the inserted
cane.
