of the Porte have been unreasonably forgotten or neglected. They are fully
as wretched as the Slavs or Cretans have been ; and in so far worse off,
that in Europe there exists no large body of tribes making murder_and
robbery its regular and daily occupation as the Kurds, and lat Cane
Circassians also, have done in Armenia. If anyone will take ouble to
read the complaints of oppressions and cruelties Brg to the Porte by
the Armenian Patriarchate in 1872 (since reprintedyin England) and some ot
the more nt statements printed by the Armenians in England on the

In the 4th edition of the same book, published in 1896, the following
note appears to the passage I have quoted:

‘Shortly after this was written, the Blue Books presented to Parlia-
ment, containing reports from British Consuls in Asiatic Turkey, showed

reform party first rose in power, and nine months after the inauguration of
the Constitution. I do not question the goodwill of the reform party, but
the reform party does not comprise the whole Turkish natio#,Janjl untilthe

be well for other Christians in the Turkish Empire with their powerful
Governments at their back; but alas! there is no security for a subje
people alien in race and religion.
