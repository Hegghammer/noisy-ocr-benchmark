murderers. Of the “truth” of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better. .
No one has ever reprinted those authors in
themvverigueat extravagance, or their grossness.
It would be impossible ; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
| them, or even written an independent history of
the highwaymen. Whenwe consider how astonish:
ingly popular those romances have ever been
Tsoi have had Claude Du Vall, and Turpin,
and their like for heroes, this is not a little
surprising.
Perhaps the task has been abandoned because
of the difficulty—the almost insuperable difficulty (Y)
—of sifting fact from fiction, and because a ‘
chittling ~sense that it would be a tnt
to present the highwayman as he really was: a
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No Kovttist—tontd
be likely tof the frank historian for this dis-
service ; Ain do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
