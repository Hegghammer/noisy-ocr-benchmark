erence to others when available. The rolls of thick inner bark are

allowed to dry for several weeks. Then they are placed in water,

to remain until pliable. They are then split into strips of proper

thickness and width> Factories use a very simple motor driven

machine for making the strips, and any manual training shop can

devise some scheme for accomplishing this work. These strips cut

in indefinite lengths must be made pliant by a thoro soaking just

previous to use. In weaving they should be pressed close together

with the fingers or with the aid of a hammer, as there is an appreci-’— ~~~

able shrinkage especially in their width upon drying. Such strips

are used mainly by ma rustic outdoor and porch furniture

for the weaving of the backs, arms and seats of chairs, and have

at present no general use in school shops. Their use here should

be encouraged. If bought of the manufacturer these strips cost 40

cents per pound, dry. They are put up in coils, and are 44 in. wide

and 1/16 in, thick. They may be stripped into narrower widths

by means of a hand stripper, soon to be described.
