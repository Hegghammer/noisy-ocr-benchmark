On the field the ever victorious army of little Japan undermined Russia’s
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
defeated and ever retreating army of colossal Russia. At sea th Cor
victorious Japanese I‘leet succeeded in completely annihilating: lssian
lleet. It was war such as the world had never y@t c— The secret of
such astounding successes should be investigated, < here I beg leave to
quote from yopé of a series of articles in which I gave view to my opinions
during es War. ‘Japan may be likened to the bundle of
faggots in ple firmly tied together ; one faggot of larger dimensions in
the centre, the sovereign round whom the whole nation clusters, and all,
ruler and people tied together by adamantine bands of patriotism.”

These remarks of mine were based on observations of actual facts. In
national unity Japan stands as an object lesson to the world; she furnishes
an exateplerwtnelmthe world needs to copy, and which a nation so politically
forlorn as ourselves more than any other needs to copy.

From the astounding success of Japan let us turn to the posit fe

| Great Republic of the United States of America occupies in the world, ‘and
take the lesson to heart of what Union can accomplish as we contrast their
present position with the position that the handful of puritan pilgrims occupied .
when they first landed of Mentaricat oir HOCtihnte three" itddred years ago.

National Unity is our greatest need; it is the banner which we must
raise up over our national life. National Unity must be engraven on the
tablets of our minds_and_throb in the pulses of our hearts. There are
mountains of difficilties before us, and if ever we must reach the goal we
can only do so by being bound together like the bundle of faggots in the
fable, with no weakening or loosening of the bands. a i we
might once more be able to get an independent footing on thd hjstgfric j
of our fathers, and perhaps once more rally round our own flag ia /
ese_lives for the State, not for himself; we have ate for which to dive; -
but let us live for our communities whilst we kedp thé hope in our hearts
that communities grow into States.

We have grit and endurance in an unparalleled degree, but thes
characteristics will profit us nothing if weacervanting-wunity.

Let us rem r that utterance of the Founder of our faith. In \u
loyalty and aljéfiance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents o
cataract, bu%weSmfust remember His warning utterance :—

“What shall it profit a man.” What shall it profita nation. Unity is
the soul of a nation. Let us keep our soul and not lose it.
