Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Enypire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this super-added eure O
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, gyeater Aiders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular cctpation Gt ves comprise:
murder and robbery, and who have through weary ¢enturies unremittinzly
er upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits df theiflabour and toil. Indeed as the Hamidieh cavalry which
was establi expressly for the Hamidtan massacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized murder, can now find for those habits in
which they were encouraged and trained to indulge by the Hamidiaa
régime,

Under all such conditions no hope of better days can be forthcoming
no prospect of better times seems possible, for that unhappy portion ffs
Armenian race whom force of circumstances keeps on the soil of/the

| fatherland,

The appointment of Christian governors over the provinces in-
habited by them might amelosrere_sancalthecrilsrocthoather alternative,

allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespective of creed or

Prascesvs would furnish some means of self-defence against the raids

barbarities of the oppressors; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christian peasaat subject to Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his enemies, must remain one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Not the snost fertile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the n absiduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, Li o the
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a mpdicum of thdt tomf /
happiness, and security of life and property, Gi law of all civilzed -
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer ahd ler of the soil.
