THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE. 49
having only her kirtle upon her back. John Gower, howey mh a
wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus dlp onmpany of
ladies. They were, says he, “clothed all alike, in kirtlés with rich capes
or mantl4sypayti-coloured, white, and blue, embroidered all over with
various devices.” Their bodies are described as being long and small,
and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though each of them
had been a queen. We find that the tight-laced young ladies of the
court of the Lady Triamore “had mantles of green-coloured velvet, | :
handsomely bordered with gold, and lined with rich furs, Their heads
wernt SRO In kerchiefs, and were ornamented with cut work and
richly-striped wires of gold, and upon their kerchiefs they had. each of (/\
them a pretty coronal, embellished with sixty gems or more ;” and of
| their pretty mistress it is said in the same poem, that her cheeks were as
red as the rose when it first blossoms. Her hair shone upon her head
like golden wire, falling Beneath x Gown of fold Fichly Grnamented with =,
precious stones. Her vesture was purple, and her mantle, lined with white |
rmine, was also elegantly furred with the same. The Princess Blanche,
the daughter of Edward-III., the subject of the annexed illustration,
appears to have copied closely the dress above described, and, like the
maids of honour of the Lady Triamore herself, she is not only richly
habited but thoroughly well-laced as well. Thus we see, in yfar
1361, the full influence of the corset on the costume of that pefidd.
‘There is another poem, said to be more scien even Launfal, ‘
which, no doubt, served to give a tone and directh o the fashicns of
times following after. Here we find a beautiful lady described as
wearing a splendid girdle of beaten gold, embellished with rubies and
emeralds, about her middle small. ONION
Cov fen describing a lover who is in the act of admiring
his mistres%f thus writes:— —-
“ He seeth hir shape forthwith, all |
Hir bodye round, hir middle small.”
