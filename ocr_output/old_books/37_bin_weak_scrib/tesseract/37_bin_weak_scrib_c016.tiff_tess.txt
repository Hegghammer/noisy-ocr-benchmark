THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER

And nde way that the story of The Boy
Apprenticed to an Enchanter used to begin.

But first I shall have to tell you about King
Manus and his three horses.

King. Nepus zuled over the Western Island, and
he had a castle that was neither higher nor wider
than any other King’s castle. But he had a stable

| that was more strongly built than any other King’s
stable. It had double walls of stone; it had oak
beams; it had an iron door With Tour 16¢Ks 6 tt ~~

Ge before this door two soldiers with drawn
swords in their hands stayed night and day.

In those days, if-one went before a King and
asked him for a gift the King might not refuse to
give what was asked of him. But King Manus
was hard to come to by those with requests. For (
befare the_chamber where he sat or slept sw)
stood a servant to take the request, and if it w
one that might not be brought to him, to make an
excuse for the King. eee

It was all b se of the King’s three horses —

a white hora red horse, and a black horse.
The white horse was as swift as the plunging wave
