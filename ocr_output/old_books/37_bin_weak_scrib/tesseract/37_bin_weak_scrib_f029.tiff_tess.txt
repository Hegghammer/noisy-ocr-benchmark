and humour blended. pew
There ig. nothing neater in all the history of
highway, an this anecdote, twinkling brightly
amid thi tter-of-fact records of a degenerate
day.
There is plentiful evidence that when Captain
Alexander Smith in 1719-20 wrote and published
his work upon the highwaymen and other evil-
doers, he based his book upon the many chap-
books and broadsides then in existence. Many
of them may even now be found by those who
| do not mind searching for them, but whether
they will repay the trouble is quite another
matter. Le includes ir Wie HAMS even Robi
C / Hood and Sir John Falstaff; and, not concerned
point out their legendary or merely literary
character, gives ar exact (though necessarily not
a truthful) biography of each.
Several editions of Smith exist; some in three,
others in two volumes. The title-pages vary (Y)
largely, but all are extremely lengthy, and so ‘
carious that it is well worth while to repn¢
one as on the next page.
Captain Alexander Smith took an immense
delight in his villains. You cannot fail to per-
ceive, if you read his book, that his aly ONE
was for a fee in the art. Royalist to the
heart’s cofe ‘ef him, he expends his most loving
labours upon the freebooters who displayed his
own political bias, and there can be little doubt
