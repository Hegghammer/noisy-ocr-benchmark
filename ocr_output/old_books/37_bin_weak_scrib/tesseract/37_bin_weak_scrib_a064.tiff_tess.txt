Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
‘Turkish rule? To this question, we must answer an emphatic No!

‘The causes that must operate against any change are many and deep-
seated. In the first place it cannot be expected that a few Turks Sol
ideas (or it may be French polished) at Constantinople, are going hang
the thought and character of the nation. The papain of a people
change very slowly, if they ever change at all, andgfic predominant national
traits of thesmany-blooded modern Turk have been shown to the world to
be, cruel €nd)fanaticism, combined with a fierce sensuality ; and what is
more than all And which has to be remembered most, is, that they are a
people acctsfomed to the unbridled gratification of their worst passions.

‘The ethnographic traits of the Turkman which history bears out, are
wildness and fierceness, and it would not be incorrect to argue that with the
instincts of his primitive ancestors have been assimilated the many cross
currents abaLvunLin his veins, into all of which has been infused the
doctrines of the religion of the sword, a religion which does not make/for
the peace or well being of mankind; a religion, also, which signe
the two sexes to the degraded position of being created solely for the/gross

| pleasure of the other, does not make for the exaltation of mankind.

To quote again the eminent authority previously referred to: ‘'No
Mahommedan race or sdynase\hes-ererchomemcelinable to govern well
even subjects of its own religion, while to extend equal rights to subjects of
a different creed is forbidden by the very law of its being.”

Not the Jewish conceit proclaiming itself God’s elect and chosen, and
originating the nate “heathen ” which it scorned. Not the Christian conceit
emanating from the Jewish source, and laying the flattering unction to its
soul of superiority over the “heathen ” of its own time. Nofyheyunbending
caste exclusiveness of the Brahman across whose path everf the Sha
the despised Sudra falling would be deemed defilement. Ndt 6 fiber /
can equal the intolerant religious pride of the nmedan, or rea€l |
pmnacle of-religious self-sufficiency on which h seated himself. “To be
a Mahommedan, is enough—Cela suffit.

To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans, afd
intimate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forciply,
and that is, the Mahommedan is above“altthingsa Mahommedan is
religion is th paramount question in his life, and remains its predomidating
feature ab everything else. This should not be surprising, since to ‘the
‘faithful 7 Paradise is secured, and all crimes and transgressions against
“unbelievers ” absolved.
