and led in a step or two to a door. It was of very stout
oak and plated with iron. They opened it and found
that it had eight great iron bolts that could be shut on
that side. Within was a second door equally strong
and, on opening that, they found themselves in the secret

the whole it was a distinctly pleasant apartment despite
the absence of any visible windows. There were even
one or two pictures on the walls. In one corner on the
outer wall was a dogr;Which the children opened, and
which clearly led underground passage below the
moat; but they decided not to examine any more that
night. So they made their way up the stairs again back
to their room.
