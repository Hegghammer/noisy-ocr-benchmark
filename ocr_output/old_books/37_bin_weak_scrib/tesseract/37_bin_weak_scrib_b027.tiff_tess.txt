CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. 5
No. VI.

In this Group by Mr. Epwin Lanpszer there is much of violent animal Zxpression, and
Character fades before it, or rather, is absorbed in it. It tells a story of the past as well as the
present, and is pregnant with a catastrophe not difficult to anticipate from the actions and
expressions of the partics engaged. A Fawn has been seized by a LEorarn, who has been
despoiled of his prey by a more powerful T1cer. The Tiger in his turn becomes the victim of an
enraged Lion. a :

The expression of the wounded Leopard is that of painful suffering mingled with dread.
Together, they amount to agony. Ie shrieks while he submits. The ‘Tiger is still enraged and
resisting, though astounded with the power and suddenness of the Lion’s attack. He is losing his
energy of resistance, and is beginning to feel that all resistance is vain. He roars with anguish;
while his expression is that of terror, and indignation not yet subdued. wa

The Liou, who has just made bis thundering spring, appeay cious of having fatally scized
his adversary, and luxuriates fearlessly in his Y¥toxysythdwith a powerful and just expression of
carnivoropseyigyment.—Meanwhile the chart€ters of the animals, severally, are faithfully and
specificallyreprezented.

Al&Xgug)Aur main purpose be to exhibit rather a pictorial than a physiological view of the
subject: having descanted on the word Character, we shall probably be expected to add, at least
a word or two, on the leading characteristics of the carnivorous class of quadrupeds.

nAbsaomeignghurgcters of the Veline, or Cat, kind, are easily enumerated in the concise

language of the naturalists. Their heads are round; their visages short/ they have six cutting

teeth, and two canine, in cither jaw: their tongues are aculeated, the \pyickles inclining backward ;

| their claws sharp, hooked, and retractile ; their cars small and acuminated ; they have five toes on
each of the fore-feet, and four only on those behind.

d : Of this genera of Catsy we here cahithe ths four priacal species, Lions, Tigers, Leopards,

and Panthers, of which the Lion is justly placed at the head—at least, the unanimous voice of ages

Ims-pronounced him to be the king of beasts, and we have enthroned him accordingly in our Title-

page, (No. I.) They form a tribe that is especially and properly Carnivorous, being the only

class of quadrupeds that are exclusively flesh-caters. They jaws) are very completely armed tor

this purpose; their canine teeth being very long and oy edg’ the angles turned

toward the inside of their mouths; so that when jmal hrefs caused fhem to 1 cufor cross each

“other in the"HESH of its prey, these formidable teth wil¥ cut or tear a Way through, by drawing

them back without opening his mouth.
Their claws, and the formation of their feet, too, are eminently epndufive to their predacious
