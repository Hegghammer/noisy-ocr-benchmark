THE STORY OF EEAN THE FISHERMANâ€™S SON
on the ass, (An ass is driven back over the
mountains into the country that they came from,
these men.

And in such boats we went down the river and
came into Babylon. No city in the world is as
mighty or as wonderful as Babylon. It has three
hundred and sixty-five streets, and in every street
there are three hundred and sixty-five palaces,

lana to every palace there are three hundred and
sixty-five steps leading up torits-doervf-goldanbrE
y. The streets when we came into them
Ter mona with mighty, black-bearded men. I
was much in dread wher-I stood in those great
streets, and looked on the mighty men who went
through them.

In the center of the city were the palace and the (
wide-spreading gardens of the King. In thos)
gardens, as my master told me, were one or two 0
all the beautiful or terrible animals of the world.
Those gardens I will speak of again, O King,
for it was within them that I came upon the
danger that wef greater than the danger that
I am now in.
