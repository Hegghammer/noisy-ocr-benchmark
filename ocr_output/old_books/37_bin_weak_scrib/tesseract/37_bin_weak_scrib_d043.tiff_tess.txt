CHAPTER III
Own
HATE AND LOVE

LINE certainly did not belong to any ordinary
A type and she would have puzzled the psychol-

ogist to classify. She was so many sided as to
be in.a class by herself. She had plenty of commgn
sense_ and intelligence for her years and an outlook
Sflialy fair minded and just. But she also had a
q auteur, curiously coupled with humility, and at
the same time a winning manner that was irresistible;
so that the strange thing was that she had only to ask
and most people voluntarily submitted to her desires.
This unusual power might have been very dangerous
to her character and spoiled her, had it not been that
what she wanted was almost always just and reason-
able and—moreoyer she never used her power for her O
own benefit. Further, her humble estimate of her own
capacity for judgment caused her but rarely to exercise
the power at all. In practice it was almost confined
to those cases where a sweet minded child’s naturalin-,W._
stinct for fair play sees further than the sophistries of
the adult. hon

She was practidalily~unaware of this power, which
was destined to bring her into conflict with Eleanor
Mowbray ; nor did she take the least delight, as she might
easily have done, in exercising power for power’s sake.
