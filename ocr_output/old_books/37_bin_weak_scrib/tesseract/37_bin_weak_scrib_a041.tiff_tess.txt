like a round how, a great brown cye revealed the inward spirit’s intelligence and zeal un-
quenched. On his head was a close-titting cap of purple velvet.

Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century’s greatest: men—Mazditch
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian peop] sient
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called tchmiatzin, or MiyMeutf¥-Begotten
is Descended.” From the window of a neighboring room he Might ouked across the
frost hound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were vow aleCut close and huried for the
winter, Beyoncdithe plain stood a dark mass of whirling suow’ and hurricane that hid the
cone of Ararg? ad just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of thtt4ake) ecighty-seven years ago, Khrimian was born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was\still yAdiminished by sea or land ; the Sultan still counted ag one of the formid-
able Powers furope. It was four years before Byron sct out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the geucrous champion of freedom—a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Near dast. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Watholikos now looked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to last it had been inspired by one absorbing and unselfish aim—the freedom and
regencration of his people, It is trac he had failed.

From his earliest years, when he had witnessed the terrors of Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round .Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationalitv—sugh a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance anipy& the
prosperous and contented of the world. THe began as a poet, wandering far and wide tWrough

| the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wife’s death, he devoted himself to the building of schools,
which he generously threw fOr DoS MERAY tS OPA atienians. For many
Years, while Europe was occupied with Crimean wars, Austrian wars, or French and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying from Van to Constantinople and through the
itics of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emblems of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When elected="tfnfémian patriarch of Constantinuple (1860), he was driven from
his ofhee after four years.

But the cup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiless stuughter of-Bulgurians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. WAh/vared motises
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, afid AX )Aipxttr fi

done with success for the Lebanon. Tn London he hecame aiuted with Gladstone ; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing fer his people beyond the promises ff
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in cheek aid
enforce Turkey’s definite reforms. It is nec TE a RAC evi of these promisk: ahd

So it wht de Detained in Constantinople ax prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake:
