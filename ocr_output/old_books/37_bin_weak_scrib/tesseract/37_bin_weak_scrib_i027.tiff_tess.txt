THE ae LAST VOYAGE
passenger beside me called out to Captain
Turner in a perfectly clear and calm voice,
“‘Captain, what do you wish us to do?”
“Stay right where you are, Madam, she’s
all right.” Then the woman asked him,
“Where do you get your information?”—
| and he replied in rather a severe and com-
manding voice, ‘“‘From the -enginme-roomporernnenE
adam.” She and I turned and walked
Pris aft and tried to reassure the pas-
sengers we met. —_——
As I looked around to see to whom I could
be of the greatest help it seemed to me that
about everyone who passed me wearing a
life belt had it on incorrectly. In their hurry
they “put them on every way except the O
right way: one man had his arm through
one armhole and his head through the
other; others had them on around the waist ~~~ ~
and upside dove at very few had them on
correctly. I Stopped these people and spoke
(11) .
