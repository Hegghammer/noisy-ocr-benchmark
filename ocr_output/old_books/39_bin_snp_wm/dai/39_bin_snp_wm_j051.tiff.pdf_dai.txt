the end in place. Draw the strand over the edge and bottom of
rail 1 and up at the inner corner, then over the top and edge of rail
2. This binds the loose end in place if it has not been previously
tacked. Pull the strand directly across the frame opening to the
top of rail 3 at corner B. Draw it over the edge of the same rail
and under, then up at the inner corner and over the top and edge
of rail 1. Pull directly across the frame opening to the top of rail
4 at corner C. The operations at corners C and D are identical to

those at A and B, and these repeat themselves indefinitely at each
corner, or until the seat is completed. This applies to square seats
only. The end of the last strand may be secured with a tack under
the proper rail, or twisted around a strand underneath the seat.
The strand is twisted as the weaving progresses. This may be
done with the palm of the hand and thigh, in much the same man-
ner as a shoemaker waxes his thread. If one leaf of rush is used to
make the strand, new leaves are added by tying the two ends în a
square knot at a corner, or wherever such joining will not show on
the finished seat. When more than one piece of rush is used for a
strand the pieces should be of uneven lengths initially. One leaf or
piece at a time is then added. The upper or top end of the leaf is
used to begin the seating and each leaf added is attached at its top
end.
Some expert rush seaters do not tie knots in making strands, but
add leaves by twisting the end of the preceding leaf about the added
one, “like the color on a barber pole," as one old rush weaver re-
marked. Adding by twisting only is difficult, and requires great
patience and dextrous handling of the material. In fact rush
should be used by the more skilful boys only. Others may use the
excellent substitute, fiber.
