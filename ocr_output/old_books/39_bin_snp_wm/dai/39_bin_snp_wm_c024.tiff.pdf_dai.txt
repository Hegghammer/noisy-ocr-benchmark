THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
came on without sails or oars. It was a shining
boat, a boat of brass. I called to my father and
my father straightened himself up and watched it.
In the boat that came toward us of its own accord
there was man standing.
The boat came into the full water between the
rocks, and then it sank down, this boat of brass, un-
til its rim touched the water. It remained still as
if anchored. The man who was in thein the 
prow of the
boat stepped out on the sand between my father
and me.
He looked a man of high degree like a prince
or a potentate. He had a dark face and a dark,
curly beard, and he had eyes that were like hawks'
eyes. He had on a straight coat of a blue
material covered all over with curious figures,
and in his hand he held a long polished staff
that had the shape of two serpents twisting to-
gether. He looked at me and I was frightened of
him, and I turned to my father. But my father
was standing there, holding the fishing pole in
his hands, his mouth open, gasping like one of the
fishes upon the rocks.
