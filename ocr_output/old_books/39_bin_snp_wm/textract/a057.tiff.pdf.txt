Church, but was also a fearless patriot- distinguished linguist, all elogaent preacher, and a
thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being hade for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the feared fanatical aprising of the Turks, threw prudenee to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history.
At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nercès, the Patriareh, their object lieing to request the signatory lowers of
the Berlin Treaty to foree a guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.
Abdul Ilamid and his advisers were furious at this affront, and Monseigneur Nercès was
summoned to the Palace. It is said that when he received the summions lie simply smiled
and asked one of of his curates to read the Barial Service to him, as le did not expect to
return alive. Howeyer, he trent. No one has ever heard what passed between the Sultan
and himself at the interview; suffice it to say that he immediately summoned the Armenian
General Assembly and tendered his resignation. This was not accepted by the Assembly,
and, amidst enthusiastie cheers, lie was carried back to his apartments at the Patriarchate.
Meanwhile a peremptory order reached him, signed by the Sultan, to recall the Armeuian
delegation from Berlin. This Monseigneur Varjabétian point-blank refused to do, and retired
to his private residence at Haskeuy, it village on the Golden Horn. The suceess of the dele-
gation, however, did not come up to his expectations. The Armenians, as it happened, could
not be heard, but they were so far successful as to have an article inserted in the treaty.
The Sultan and his advisers never forgave the Patriareli thris, though they could not
openly do anything to him on account of his enormous popalarity. Time passed on, and to
all appearance the incident was forgotten, but it was not so. One summer afternoon a most
cordial invitation was sent by a very high dignitary of the Palace, requesting the Arehhishop
to
dine with him informally. An invitation of this kind could not very well be refused, so
the Archbishop, accompanied only by à hody-servant named Vartan, repaired to the Pasha's
house. The Pasha received him at the +loor and escorted the visitor with much ceremony and
extreme courtesy to a private apartment of the salamlik of his house (the men's quarters),
where dinmer was served. The geniality displayed by his host dispelled any fears that the
Arehbishop miglit have had as to his personal safety.
After dinner, as issual, coffee was served. Now, this serving of the coffée is rather
a
ceremonial according to high Turkish etiquette, and it is not unusal for guests to bring their
own tchooboukdar (the servant who carries his master's pipe and pouch and also superintends
the making of his coffee). The Archbishop tras presented with a "tehoobouk (pipe) filled
and lighted for smoking, and n servant followed with coffee. The Archibishop necepted both
with due compliments to his host, and took a sip at lis coffec. Jast nt that monient the
heayy curtains over the doorway were thrown apart, revealing the ghastly pale face of his
servant Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, in a voice trembling with emotion, "Monseigueur,
I did not brew the coffec!
This was enough for the Archbishop ; he pretended to be startled and spilt the coffec, but,
alas ! he liad already drunk a small quantity of it. Meanwhile a seuille has going on behind
the portière, where his poor servant Vartan was paying the penalty of lis devotion to his
master. Concerning Vartai's whereabouts or his ultimate end nothing was ever made pablie
the poor fellow simply vanished. Monseigneur Varjabétian, after a short interval thanked
the Pasha for liis generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily summoned. The Patriarchi took to his bed,
and lost all his hair through the effects of the poison. Then, one morning, when a servant
