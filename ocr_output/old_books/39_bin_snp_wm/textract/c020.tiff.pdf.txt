THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
story-teller's place and fresh candles were lighted
and set upon the table.
"Your danger is great," said the King, "and it
will be hard for you to show us that you were
ever in such danger before. Begin your story.
And if it is not a story of a narrow and a close
escape there will be little time left for you to pre-
pare for your death by the sword.
Thereupon the youth in the foreign dress looked
long into the wine cup that was handed him, and
he drank a draught of the wine, and he saluted
the King and the lords who sat by the King, and
he said :
"Once I was in greater danger, for its mouth
was close to me, and no hope whatever was given
me of my saving my life. I will tell the story,
and you shall judge whether my danger then was
greater than is my danger now."
And thereupon the youth in the foreign dress,
who had tried to steal the white horse that King
Manus owned, began the story which is set down
here in the very words in which he told it.
