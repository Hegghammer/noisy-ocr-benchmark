| THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
| los made by the inistig of the old fates
of the sea with the steam of the boilers. I
~ saw an interesting statement in one of the
papers, purporting to have come from Cap-
tain Turner, in which he stated that the small
amount of suction was probably due to the
fact that the bow of the boat was already
gesting on the bottom when the stern went
down. This seems quite feasible, asshe sank
in about 60 fathoms (360 feet) of water and
‘The sea was wonderfully smooth, and it
seemed to me that if one could keep clear of
the wreck and’ pick up a lifeboat, that it
- eould be manned and that we could go
4 back and get many survivors. _ I was able to | ae
work this out quiteasI planned,
_.As'I waited for the final plunge something
- caught me on the top of my head and slipped
_ down to my shoulders, pressing me under
the water; I couldn’t imagine what it was,
