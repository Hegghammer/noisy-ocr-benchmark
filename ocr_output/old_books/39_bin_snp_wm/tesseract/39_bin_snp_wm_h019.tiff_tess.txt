MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE...
_. It will be seen by the engraving that the old house isdouble. The =
_ > western part is that which was built by Barnabas in 1659-60. The
east or two-story part was built by Jonathan 1., about 1682. Theupper
-* room of this part was used for a court-house for nearly twenty years,
-as we learn from Thompson’s History of Long Island, and some of
~~ the old benches used when it was a.court-house are still preserved.
- The old ‘castle,’’ as Jonathan G. Horton, its last Horton occupant,
used to call it, is in all probability the oldest wood house in America,
. TD know of ‘no dwelling-house of any kind, stone or brick, now stand-. a
ing, that can date back as far as this venerable old mansion. There
"were a few huts on the east of Long Island previous to 1640—two. or Pee
three it is said on Shelter Island. . But these, as well as those built-by - AS
-. the Puritans, immediately on their settlement in Southold, soon all
- passed away. Not a vestige of any of the first generation buildings
can be found except this one, It remained for the house that Barnabas.
ss built ‘to “survive the wreck of ages, and ‘to: stand to-day as a noble fies
‘representative of the dwellings of two hundred and fifteen years ago.
But the old house stands to-day not only as peering above all others =
“by its age, but also by its occupancy: It is not very often that we find) <
_ two generations of the same name, living anddyingin thesamehouse—
rarely find three. But here we have six generations in succession, all
- bearing the Horton name, living and dying in the same house, and Se
all born in it except Barnabas I., and his son Jonathan. Wemaygo
