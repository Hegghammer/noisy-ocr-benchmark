DON Boo ag ee
as the town was named, ie. the “hill-staple” =
or market, and his successors were often there.
‘Phe wool market was the most important at
‘Dunstable; the monks long maintaining great ©
flocks of sheep on the adjacent downs. =
The robbers became only a memory, but a =~
memory that never faded. It merely took on =
- another form, and in the course of time the name
of the town itself was twisted into an allusion =
to them and to their leader. It needed the col-
~ lusion of gross ignorance and wild legend to effect
so much, but the thing was done; and for cen-
-. turies Dunstable was, and perhaps even now is,
locally said to owe its name to “Dun’s Stable,”
a hollow in the chalk downs, ‘potted out as having ne moe
been the place where “Dun,” the entirely ima-
_ ginary leader of the ovilaws, stabled his horse.
Jf you doubt this there is the town seal tocon- >
vince the sceptical, showing as it does what is
said to be a horseshoe (a shoe of Dun’s horse!), _
- but is really intended fora staple or hasp. =
The legendary Dun was a kind of bogey to
the children of the neighbourhood, and in John-
- gon’s pages is a most bloodthirsty creature.
There we read that his first exploit was on the
- highway to Bedford, where he meta waggon full
of corn, going to market, drawn by a fine team
_ of horses. He accosted the waggoner, and in the =>
midst of conversation stabbed him to the heart =~
_. withadagger. He buried the body, and drove the
- waggon. off to the town, where he sold the com =
and the waggon as well, and then disappeared!
