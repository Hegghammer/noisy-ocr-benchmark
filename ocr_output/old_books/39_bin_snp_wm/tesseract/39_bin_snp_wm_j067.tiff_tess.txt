Ss ‘The’ discussion of the weaving processes to follow is confined,
ae 8 - in the main, to stools or seats. _ Fig. 53 shows several stools different ce
. in design ‘both: in wood construction and-in weaving. In'two in- >
on “stances it willbe noted. that weaving is done. over.a separate frame,
ss one being inserted: between’ the fails, the other fastened on top, —
“- Jeaving ‘a little projection. Reference is made-to several possible
weaving designs and the use of various mediums and combinations. ~
“Fhe possible combinations of materials are merely suggestive of — —
-. «possible other‘ones, and the individual: worker will find that many: ee
designs of varying complexity may be worked out.’ An-excellent ~-
~ method for working out possible designs is. that of using black and.
oS owhite paper strips 1 in, in width. The design will show up very" aes
or -clearly because of ‘the contrast of the black and white: Experiz
menting with’ the weave on the seat itself is.rather tedious and
need ‘unsatisfactory. "The paper strips are‘an excellent: means toanends >.
© <>. "The stool top illustrated. in Fig. 54 employs.a-simple over-and-
under. weave, utilizing. flat. reed.. “The worker neéds to. decide at.
the ‘outset: on “the character of weave to be ‘used’ unless it, beof
unusual design. In this. instance the weaver.runs over three and ©

strand around the two rails, without running it across: the top. >

 Mecessary to cut the strand; the wrapping is continuous. Repeat.
