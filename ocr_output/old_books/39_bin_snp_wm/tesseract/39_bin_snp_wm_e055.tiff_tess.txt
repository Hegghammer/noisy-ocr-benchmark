| wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus describes a companyof |
_— | ladies. They were, says he, “clothed all alike, in kirtles with rich capes |
| or mantles, parti-coloured, white, and blue, embroidered all over with |
_ |. various devices.” Their bodies are described as being long and small, |
| and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though each of them,
| had been a queen. We find that the tight-laced young ladies of the — I oe
| court of the Lady Triamore “had mantles of green-coloured velvet, | sn
| handsomely bordered with gold, and lined with rich furs, Their heads |
| were neatly attired in kerchiefs, and were ormamented with cut work and, |
| >. richly-striped wires of gold, and upon their kerchiefs they had. each of A :
|. them a pretty coronal, embellished with sixty gems or more; andof |
| their pretty mistress it is said in the same poem, that her cheeks were as |
| red as the rose when it first blossoms. Her hair shone upon her head |
ope Tike golden wire, falling beneath 2 crown of gold richly ornamented with ee
| precious stones. . Her vesture was purple, and her mantle, lined with white = |
- | ermine, was also elegantly furred with the same. The Princess Blanche, |
| the daughter of Edward IIL, the subject of the annexed illustration, = |
_ | appears to have copied closely the dress above described, and, like the =|
| maids of honour of the Lady Triamore herself, she is not only richly |
_ | habited but thoroughly well-laced as well, Thus we see, in the year +
~ | ° 1361, the full influence of the corset on the costume of that period. =

| which, no doubt, served to give a tone and direction yto the fashions of = |
CRS times” following after. _ Here we find a beautiful lady described as. fo”
| wearing a splendid girdle of beatkn gold, embellished with rubies and |
| emeralds, about her middle small,
