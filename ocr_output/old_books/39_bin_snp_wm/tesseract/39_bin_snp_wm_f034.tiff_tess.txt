the landlady went off to the nearest justice and
swore an information. against Gamaliel, who was
arrested and thrown into prison, but not before he
had found time to return home and bury the bag
in the garden. In confidence he fold his mother = __
where it was hid, his mother told his sister, his
~ sister told her husband, her husband told his
friends, and so at last the confession reached the
ears of the justices. Gamaliel would undoubtedly
have been hanged on that occasion, only he broke

enough, one of these incidents is concerned with
-.. the robbing of an actor, whom Ratsey bids deliver
-.. his money first, and a scene from Hamlet after- _

_amce with the best models that the unnamed
| quthor of Ratsey’s life failed to put life into
his narrative. The incident is treated in asdead
