Remember that they know not what they do
Who strike in deadly fear and ghastly hates
_.. Remember that somehow, and at some time,
_- Each crime exactsitshuman penalty,
Remember that man’s conscience and man’smind
Are agents of Thy purpose and Thy plan,
Which work within a deadlier revenge
_. Than any shrapnel shot or sabre thrust.
Remember that new generations come _ : S eS . : . a 4
_. Upon whom fall the burden and the curse,
_.. The crushing debt, the struggle and despair. eS
Restrain, O God, the sweep of this vasthate;
oe Recall the nations to their sense of shame: oe Sees
‘To those in blinding war, tous at peace, =
_ Reveal anew the message of the Christ.
