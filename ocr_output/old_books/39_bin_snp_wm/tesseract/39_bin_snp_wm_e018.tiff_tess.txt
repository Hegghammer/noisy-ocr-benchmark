| of South America, whose history is lost in remote antiquity, have brought — |
| to light most singular evidences of the existence of a now forgotten |
| race. Amongst the works of art discovered there is a bas-relief repre- [|
ae ~ senting a female figure, which, in addition to. a’ profusion. of massive |
eee ornaments, wears. a complicated and elaborate waist-bandage, which, — poe
| by a system of circular and transverse folding and looping, confines the |
ot waist from just below the ribs to the hips as firmly and ‘compactly asf
| the most unyielding corset of the present day.
| At the period of the discovery of some of the islands of the |
| Eastern Archipelago, it was found customary for all young females to |
| wear a. peculiar kind of corset, formed of spirally-arranged rattan [|
| cane, and this, when once put on, was not removed until the celebration =|
| of the marriage ceremony. Such races as were slowly advancing in the |
_. | march of civilisation, after discovery by the early navigators, became | |
| - more and more accustomed to the use of clothing, to adjust and retain | -
_- | which, waistbands would become essentially requisite. These, when |
|. made: sufficiently broad to fit without undue friction, and stiff enough to |
| “prevent folding together in the act of stooping, sitting, or moving |
| about, at once became in effect corsets, and suggested to the minds |
| of the ingenions a system of cutting and fitting so as more perfectly to |
| adapt them to the figure of the wearer. ‘The modes of fastening, as |
| we shall see, have been various, from the simple sewing together with |
|. the lace to the costly buckle and jewelled loop and stud.
