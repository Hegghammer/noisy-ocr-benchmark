was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples which with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fathe land that race was the Artenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottonian commary as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engage in
commerce and agricalture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase the value of
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few among them justly started an agitation, these our noble
and industrions brethren were being massacred. What a terrible scene
When
left the school building we saw hundrels of the bedies of our Armenian compatriots being
removed in ngurire carts ; legs and arms were hanging down outside. This body scene will
ever remain impressed on my mind.
This shocking crime of Yildiz formel a leep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a cursed absolatism, up to the last moment, grew wider. Even during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly tee ings which had been shown,
The awful events in Adana took place and the souls of all trac Osmulis inglted into tears,

understand that patriotism an 1-brotherhood do not differ from each other. The responsibility
of the government for the Armenians is very great and very weighty. The whole Ottoman
nation is under obligations to proteet this suffering race, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
is in large part de to the blond shed by the Armeniaus, We thought that these truths
were so obvious that we preferred to silence, whereas today we understand that it is
necessary from time to time to recall the greatness of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yesterday has endured only barbarisan, and for twelve years
has been constantly oppressed and grond to the earth, and has given thousands of victims.
Hereafter we must work to assure them that the eva of inassacres has passed, and with all our

We must all assist the government and point out its obligation. mas be declared in

Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
