THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
I mean those in the staterooms I cannot
speak with certainty in regard to the port-
holes on deck E I believe that the first list
the ship took broaght her down to these
open ports on the startmund side and that
she sank mach more quickly from filling
through ther..
On y retary to the dok I felt that the
stea::er must make her final plunge any mo-
rent now, and as there was nothing more that
could be done on the post vide for there was
no divepline or order with which to do it 1
passed through to the starboard side. Mea
were striving to lower the boats nd were
putting won and children into them, but it
vermed to tie that it only added horror to
the whole situation to pat people into a
boat that you knew never would be cleared
and which would go down with the stearer,
better case them on the deck to let them
take the chance at a piece of wreckage.
