Avert Thy gaze, O God, che tight Thing eyes!
Glance down, no longer on the weat, for.
Test Thố , lock old such boeron au can turn
Men's burning hearts to her, and chill their woch
Krep This heart warn, am; fu, of chanty
That Thon mayst yet be able to forgive,
And pity feel for those who know not when
To pa ito rithu ynor
Restam Thy wrath, and keep The hand in
check.
Site net, nor bercely Urast without the air
Thair who can dame
Will follow traites, infocent of wron:
Forget the stehed purune to devisy.
The Launching of the mask through the deep,
Thevaliered hill, the a ed and bleedig föru
The soothing with of merchagy, women, men
