CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
the scene of which, by the way, he has not represented as a roval menagerie, but as a wild,
rocks cavern- - his animals partake of the artificial character of which we cannot bring ourselves to
approve.
Of this fact, however, we purpose to exhibit proof with our assertion. Improved versions, to
the best abilities of our Artists, of some of these Lions of RUBENS and the Assyrian kinig, will here
be introduced, which the reader, who pleases, may compare with the originals, Our second, third,
and fourth Plates are of the number.
The Lions of RUBESS are humaniard. We do not intend to discuss at length whether the
ideality of allegorical painting required this : we only state the fact yet the opinions which we
felt at liberty to form on the subject, we feel at liberty to utter. So much in apology for using the
licence of asserting that the beads of mainy of the Lions of Rt BESS rather resemble those of frowning
old geutlemen decorated with Ramillies wigs : as if Nature's journeymer had made manis, and not
made them well. There is a profusion of tlownig and curling hair, which seems rather to solicit
the unguents of the perfinuer, tham to have endured the torrid heats of the desert, or the rougli
stormis of the forest. The shag of a Lion's mane is II very different sort of thing.
However such dressed Lions may be thought to accord with Allegory, they are demonstrably
at variance with Nature. To life sure, what might become a Lion in the procession of the Cardinal
\ irtues, miglt be rather unsuitable in lris den, or within the prechicts of those will haunts, where be
is accustomed to roam in lis natural state. We have often read of the fabled Men-bulls, or (Mino-
taurs,) and we find Such: on the of Crete. These allegorieal creatures of RUBENS,
which,
alas have sometimes been quoted by Artists without half his geuins, and placed in sivage con-
tlicts, or beside their a species of Men-lions. Placed among the Sabaran sculp-
tures, they might pass for incarnations of Sol in Leo but would very ill pass for Leo alone.
Among the observers of this poetic improvement, or this natural and unpoetical deficiency, on
the part of RUBENS, TITIAN, Tezio ROMANO, and other painters, both ancient and modern; and
of the consequent desileration on the part of the public, of a cabinet or library collection of the
nobler wild animals in a state of Nature, SO as to answer the purposes of reference, while they con-
duced to the pleasures of Taste, were Mr. EDGAR SPILSBURY and Mr. THOMAS LANDSEER.
11 bether (I/" not the public "looked up to them for light" on that subject, (to use the language of
STERNE,) they thonglit the Public "deserved it;" and they therefore, as the best practical means
of elieiting that light, first copied the general forms and attitudes of most of the wild aninials that
appear in this book, from the old masters-gvuerally speaking, that are well known
- Hand then, went to Nature and corrected the details. They carried with them what, in those
ancient masters, was meritorious in composition, attitude and chiaroscuro, and bronght away,
to the best of their bility-superadding it to, and blending it with, the abore-uccuraey of
detail.
