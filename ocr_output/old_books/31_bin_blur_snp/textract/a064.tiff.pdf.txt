Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
Turkish rule? To this question, we niust ansiver an emphatic No:
The causes that mast operate against any change are many and deep-
seated. In the first place it cannot be expected that it few Turks of liberal
ideas (or it may lic French polished) at Constantitople, are going to change
the thonght and character of the nation. The characteristics of a people
change very siowly, il the ever change at all, and the predominant national
traits of the many blocded modero l'urk have been shown to the world
to
be, cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a fierce sensitality ; and what is
more than all, and which lias to be remembered most, is, that they are a
people accustomed to the unbridied gratification of their worst passions.
The thnographic traits of the Turkman which history bears out, are
wi.dness and fierceness, and it would not be incorrect to argue that with the
instincts of his primitive ancestors have been assimilated the many cross
currents that run in his veins, into all of which has been infused
the
doctrines of the religion of the sword, a religion which does not make for
the peace or well being of mankind; a religion, also, which assigning one of
the tavo sexes to the degraded position of being created solely tor the gross
pleasure of the other. does not make for the éxaltation of mankind.
To quote agani the eminent atthority previously referred to : No
Mahommedan race or dynasty has over showni itseli able to goveri weil
IVCH subjects of its own religion, while to extenci equal rights 10 subjects
of
a difierent creed is lorbidden by the very law of its being.",
Not the Jewish conceit proclaiming itself God's elect and chosen, and
originating the name "heathen" which it scorned. Not the Christian
conceit
camanating from the lewish source, and laying the flattering anction to its
soul of superiority over the 'heathen of its own time. Not the mubencing
caste exclusweness of the Brahnan across whose patir even the of
the despised Sudra falling would be deemed defilement.
Not
any
of
these,
can cqual the intolerant religious pride of the Mahommedan, or reach the
pinnacle of religious self-sufficiency on which he has scated hinisell. To be
a Mahommedan, is enough-Cila suftit.
To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans, and
intimate with Mahomnición thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahemmedan is above all things à Mahommedan. His
religion is the paramount question in his life, and remains its predominating
fature above everything else, This should not be surprising, since to the
"faithful" Paradise is secured, and all crimes and transgressions against
unbelievers" absalved.
