I will again pass 0101 the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and rélate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
796 alter ruling over Artifenia filty eight vears.
He was a great and powerfol prince, and extended his dominions, and
grew to be so mights in battle that the neighbouring nations called his
country Aramia and the people were called Aranians, such names as
Armenia or Armenians being no doubt later corruptions.
The first victory of Aram was orer Neuchar King of Media, whom he
