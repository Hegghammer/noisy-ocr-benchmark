victimis in thy Yildiz Kiosk, found its way to thy treacherous heart. No
poisoned cup of coftee like the conntless cups brewed in thy pálaces trickled
down thy throat to end thy vampire existence.
Thou hast lived Protected from the Nemesis of thy crimes by the
jealousies and rivalries of great powers which thou artfully played one against

la the foregoing pages ] have directed my humble efforts to sketch out
what the Powers of Europe have done in the past, and how their actions
have rellected on my unfortunate race.
It is considered good polico now by a certain class of European writers
to ascribe all the horrors of the Armenian Massacrus to Hamil the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as unassailable and inconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as n sort of superhuman being who strept everything
before him to the consommation of his own despotic wril. The reason for
this is not difficult to perceive They would fain disavow the part Europe
has played in the tragedy, and to do this successfully it becomes necessary
also to present Furkey to the workd now as a paradise (from whence the
tvrant once removiti) peopled on'l in saints and angels So we have also
manx roscate colored word pictures of Constitutional Turkey.
The marders. deportations and imprisonnents of the Turkish revolo-
tionaries, or more correctiy retormers, were undoubtediy the sole work of
Abdui Hamid andi his palace clique, but Abdul and Ins minions couid

carried ont that hellish work of Wholesale extermination of the
Arnemans without the perpetration and participation of the Turkish
people It 15 true the massacres were originated and organized in the
Palace, the l'alace cuique stirred up religious fanaticism and race hatred. bat
the >operation of the people was necessary and the people co-operated
in order to plunder and enrich themselves with the worlely goods that the
Armenians abrays knew how to acquire in the ir own industry and toil : the
appeal to their marauding and bestial instincts met with a ready response
It was morcover casy work for a race of brigands, especially as their númbers
exceeded their victims lis aliout ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
