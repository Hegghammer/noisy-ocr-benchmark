Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Arinchians, and they have clung to their christian faith throngh un:
remitting persections and martyrdoms such as no other christiau people
have been called upon to endure.
The cathedral of Etchmittin built by Gregory still stands it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, until perhaps
little of the original building may be left, but it still claims to be the church
built by the patron saint of Armenia. I hall here quote a passage from
"Historical Sketch of the Armentan Church," written by an Armenian
priest :
"Owing to political circumstances the Armenian l'attiarchate had at
times to be transferred to metropolises and to other principal toirns of
Armcnia. In the year A.D. 15 2 it was removed to Dwin, in 993 to Ani.
in to Rômklah, and in 1 394 to Sis. The Kingdoin of Cilicia becoming
extinct, and. me hraving no more a kingdom and no longer a capital town, it
was natural and proper to re-transfer the See to its own original place, as
the entire nation unanimously desired it. Accordingly, in the vear 1441, it
was decided by an ecclesiastical mecting that the seat of the Catholicus should
return to Holy Exchmiatzin, where to this day has loon preserved the
proper unbroken succession from our Apostles and from our hols Father,
St. Gregory the Illuminator.
1 readi the other day in one of the foreign papers published in lapan,
the following piece of
"An Armenian Church procounced by experts todate from the second
century of the Christian era, has been discovered iir a fair state of presenva-
tion in the neiglibout hood of Bash Aparnali,
Perhaps the excasations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing nore light on Armenian history
