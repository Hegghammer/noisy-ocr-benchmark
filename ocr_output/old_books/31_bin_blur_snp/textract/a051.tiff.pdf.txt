On the field the ever VICTORTOUS army of little Japan undermined Russia's
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
deleated and ever retreating anny of colossal Russia. At sea the ever
victorious Japanese Fleet succeeded in completely annibilating the Russian
Heet. It was war such as the world had never yet seen. The secret of
such astounding successes should be investigated. and here I beg leave to
quote from one of a series of articles in which I gave view to my opinions
during the Russo-Japanese War. Japan may lie likened to the bundle
of
faggots in the fable firmly tied together : one fatient of larger dimensions in
the centre, the sovereign round whom the whole nation clusters, and all,
ruler and people tied together by adamantine banks of patriotism.
These remarks of mine were based on observations of actual facts.
In
national unity Japan stands as an object lesson to the world : she furnishes
an example which the workd needs (v) copy. and which à nation so politically
forlorn as ourselves more than any other needs to copy.
From the astounding success of Japan let us torn to the position the
Great Republic of the United States of America occupies in the world, and
take the lesson to heart of what Union can accomplish as we contrast their
present position with the position that the handful of puritan pilgrims occupied
when they first landed 01) American soil not quite three hundred years ago.

up over our national life. National Unity mast be engraven on the
tablets of our minds and throb in the pulses of our hearts. There are
mountains of difriculties before US, and if ever we must reach the goal I'll

only do SO by beine bound together like the bundle of faggots in the
fable. with no weakening or loosening of the bands Then perhaps
we
might once more be able to get an independent footing on the historical soil
of our fathers, and perhaps once more rally round our own flag. A Japan-
esc lives for the State. not for himself: we have no State for which to live,
but let US live for out communities whilst the keep the hope in our hearts
that communities grow into States.

characteristics will profit tis nothing it we are wanting in unity.
Let US remember that utterance of the Founder of our faith. In our
loyalty and allegiance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents of a
cataract, but we must remember lis warning utterance -
What shall it profit a man. 11 hat shall it profit a nation. Unity is
the soul of a nation. Let us keep our soul and not lose it.
