PREFACI: TO 2N1> PRINTING
The first and second parts of this little book were written and printed
in pamplifet form for circulation in the United States, shortly after the
Adana Massacres of April. 1909. I have now thought it advisable to add
a Supplenent of a short history of the Origin of the Armenians and the
Introduction and Revival of Christianity in Armenia.
The Mostrations and the extracts from the periodicals Harper's
Monthly, The Wide Worll" and the Cosmopolitan have been added
to the end printing.
