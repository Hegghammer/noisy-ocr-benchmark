of the l'orte have been unreasonably forgntten (1) neglected. They are fully
as irretched as the Slavs or Cretans have been ; and in so far off,
that in Europe there exists no large Lody of tribes making murder and
robbery its regular and daily occupation as the Kurds, and latterly the
Circassians also, have done in Armenia. If anyone will take the trouble to
read the complaints of oppressions and cruelties preseated to the l'orte by
the Armenian Patriarchate ii) I ST2 (sicce reprinted in Lingland) and some of
the more recent statements printed 1.1 the Armenians in England on the
same topic, he will see that the state of Turkish Asia presents as grave and
pressing a problem as that O: Bulgaria
In the ith edition of the same book. published in 1896, the following
note appears to the passage 1 have quoted

the reform party does cot comprise the whole Turkish nation, and until the
Turk learns to beceme liberal, civilized and humian, there may be no more
Armenians left, unless some Christian l'ower such as the United States
demands their protection and enforces it. No! my Christian friends, it can
lie well for other Christians in the Turkish Empire with their powerful
Governments at their backs but alas! there is no security for a subject
people alien in race and religion.
The massacres in April last raged from Adana to Alexandretta, and
according to authenticated reports about fifty thousand men, women and
chaldren were hidcously exterminated: more than this, the last massacres
were especially characterized by the most hicicous, the most loathsome, the
most revolting and ferocious cruettics perpetrated on women and children.
