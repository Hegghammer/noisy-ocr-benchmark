INTRODUCTION
TO 2sb PRINTING,
My object in writing this little book is to lay the hard case: of my un-
fortunate race before the men and women of the United States : since it is
from the United States that the American Missionaries have gone forth, who
have been the only helping intluence from without for my suffering people in
Asiatic Turkey. To the carnest and devoted men and women of the
American Missions, me Armenians owe a debt of gratitude which we can
never repay.
If in the contents of the pagrs of this little book I have exaggerated
facts by one whit or one tota, if I have deviated by one hair's breadth from
the Truth, I stand to be judged.
'God save us from another Adana, but the sword of Islam has not been

New York. The man who sounded that clarion note knew Islam, and
because knowing of my own knowledge that the sword of Islami has not Leen
dulled, I tremble lest its sharp edge fall once more on the neck of my help-
less race. If I knew and felt sure in mine own heart thatthe sword of Islam
was dulled, I would he content to let vigones be bygones, and to hold ny
peace and be silent for ever.
Like the sudden explosion of a volcano in the physical world. comes the
explosion of a Turkish Massacre of Armemans in the moral world. It comes
just in that way the subterranean lires are always there, but all of a sudden
the sulphur tlames of religious fanaticism burst, the lava floods of race batred
and lust of plunder, break forth and run in fiery streanis the untortonate
victims are pounced upon, swooped upon, pillaged, plundered, butchered,
slaughtered, subjected to outrages so hidcous, cruel, loathsome, and revolt-
ing, that no pen could depict their horrible realities and the details can neyer
go into print. The human mind is staggered and asks itself the question it
even the imaginations of fiends and devils could originate such horrois.
Then this orgy of the hnman tiends is arrested, For the time being the
appetite for blood, lust, and plunder is satistied ; for the time being, the eye
is content with the scenes of havoe and desolation lying under the sun ; the
