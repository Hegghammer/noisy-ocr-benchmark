The efforts of the Armenians, and the intreaties of their Patriarch
Nerses had procured the insertion of Articlé 16 in the Treaty of San
Stefano signed between Russia and Torkey in March 1878. In fact the
wording of the Article had been suggested by the Patriarch himself. It
provided the following stipulation for the protection of the Armenians -
As the evacuation Ls the Russian troops of the territory which they
noll occupy in Armenia, and which is to be restored to Turkey, might give
rise to conflicts and complications detrimental to the of unod
relations between the tiro countries, the Sublime Porte eagages to carty into
effect without fürther delay the improvements and reforms demanded by
local requirements in the provinces inhabited by the Armentans, and to
guarantee their security against the Kurds and Circasstaus."
What followed has bassed into history. The British Government of
which Lord Beaconsfield (then Mr. D'Isracli) was l'remier. and Lord Salis-
bury Foreign Secretary, once more pursued the old policy of battling Russian
augrandizement in Turkey Afraid that her own real or fancied interests
would thereby Lecome imperilled, England threw in the weight of ber power,
and virtually commanded the substitution of the Treaty of Berhn in lien of
the Treaty of San Stefano. Thus the substantial guarantee of a natural and
immediate protector, both able and desirous of enforcing the ,rotection which
the Armenians then had in Russia, was taken away, and the security of in
potent words given in its stead, namely -
The Sublimo Porte undert des to carry out without further delay the
improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces
inhabited by the Armenians, and to guaranted their security against the
Circassians and Kurds It will periodically make known the steps taken to
this effect to the Powers, who will superintend their application.
ll will periodically make the steps taken to thus effect to the
14/10 will superintent their afplication." How this last proviso
could furnish food for laughter were it not for the terrible tragedy involved
in it.
The insertion of Article 61 in the Treaty of Berlio, granted, or rather
seemingly granted, by the six l'owers of Furope, proved in reality, as sub
sequent events bore out, an instrument of death and torture. It was as it
the reversal of the figures had reversed the possibilities of succour and
protection, and with the death of the Czar Liberator, the last chance of the
Armenians died.
The Turkish Massacres of 1575 and 18-6 which led up to the Russo-
Turkish War of 877 are historical facts too well known to need further
