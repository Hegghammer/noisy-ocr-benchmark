WHY IND
la making a study of my race, I have found three marked characteristics
Intelligence-linergy-lndiustry. Combined with these three characteristics
is an intense Love of Nationality We live in a complex world. In an
independent people these characteristics and this sentiment are laudable
Virtues. lo a subject people they are Crimes.
After I had laid this bitter Truth to heart, I did not have to scek for the
11 thy and 11 herefore of the Armenian Massacres
The Armenian Massacres stand withont their parallel in history. The
buman mind staggers to contemplate the frendish orgies of which they have
been the victims. and no pen en describe their horrors : and this helpless
christian people are to-day in the same deadly peril as they have been since
the famous Treaty of Berlin consigned them bound hand and foot to the
inercy of their executioners.
The Armenians may be led again as sheep to the slaughter' and the
work of extermination may be Christ was crucified on
Calvary and the servant is not greater than his Lord-but the work of their
extermination only be completed when the evil intluences in the Turkish
Empire have reached their culminating point. Hitherto the l'owers of
Europe have by their jealousies and rivalries cultivated these evil influences,
they have watéred them and made them grow, but when their culminating
point is reached, they must react on Christendom and the natural
consequence must follow. Those who sow the wind, must reap the whirl-
wind. It is in tire natural order of things.
1 will allow that Liberty, Justice, Equality, Fraternity are the warchwords
Young Turkey, but Young Turkey is only a small minority ; the great
majority of the Turkish nation are not Young Turks.
The question theretore resolves itseli into this critical point: What will
Christendomi do etren now?
