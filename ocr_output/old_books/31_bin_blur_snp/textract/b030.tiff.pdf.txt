CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
the position of the head. In all gramnivorous animals, the skin of the head is closely attached to
the <kull, and capable only of very limited motion : the eve is almost uniformly inild, and the lips
ummoved by passion.
" It is in carnivorous animals, with whose habits and manner of life, ferocity is instinctively
connected, as the great meats of their subsistence, that rage is distinguished by the most
romarkable strength of expression. The eye-ball is terrible, and the retraction of the flesh of the
lips indicates the most stivage fury. But the first, is merely the exerted attention of the animal ;
and the other a proparatory expostire of the canine teeth. The great animals of prey-the Lion
and the Tiger-are quite incapable of any other expression of featurc, than this particular display
of
ferociousness. When they fawn upon their keeper, there is no motion in their features that
indicates affection."
In this assertion, that the countenances of the great auimals of prey are incapable of any
other than ferocious expression, we do not quite coincide with our learned physiologist. When
they fawn upon their keeper, we think that indications of affection are exhibited; and find
ourselves reads to ask what else than kindly expression is that "licking of the hand" which our
author has before mentioned. If, however, should grant that they may not be capable of
afféctionate expression toward their kreper, we can scarcely doubt lat-toward their young-if
we could observe them in their will state, and in their moments of playful intercourse and
enjoyment anring each other-they are: at least. we think there are motions in their features that
indicaté affection, as well as fear, enquiry, surprise, gratitude, pleasurable wantonness, and some
other sentiments, or emotions. This is our conviction: at the same time, we perceive that the
ramge of their ferocions expression far excords the savage circle of their domestic charities. Are
not even the least of these observable in the habits and manmers of the doniestic Cat, who belongs
to the Tiger But we have even seen a Tiger in lis den, who looked grood-natured enough
to be stroked and patted : and of the Lion, of whom Mri. GRIFTITH relates the following anecdote,
what can be said or thought ?
" Hearing some noise under his the Lion passed his paw between the bars, and actually
hauled uip his keeper who was cleating beneath : but as soon as he perceived that be had this ill
used his master, be instantly lay down upon his back in an attitude of complete submission.'
Or what Call be said of the mentioned by SENECA (of which he was personally
witness), of a Lion, to whom a intin, who had formerly been his keeper, was exposed for destruction
in the amphitheatre at Rome : and who was not only instantly recognised, but defended and
protected by the grateful betist ? - Or of the story related by DR. of the Lion who had
broken loose, submitting to the Cid, and allowing himself to be led back peaceably to lus place of
confinement :
