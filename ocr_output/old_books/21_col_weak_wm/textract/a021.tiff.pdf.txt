earth as other nations? Does Humanity, does Christianity allow that tender
babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and butchered
before the cyes of their mothers, or that the cars of mothers should be rent
with the cries of the dying agony of their murdered children? Does
Humanity, does Christianity allow that helpless women should be forcibly
subjected to the most hideons, the most loathsome, the most revolting, and
the most cruel ontrages Does Humanity, does Christianity, allow all this :
Christian Governments have organized a Hague Conference of Peace
and Civilization, but they have. closed its doors to the cause of a bleeding
christian race groaning under the yoke of the cruellest oppressors that the
world has yet known. Christian men and women have held up their hands
in horror at the Indina Juggernauth ; but alas! the political wheels of
Christian Governments have been a Greater luggernauth for it helpless
christian race. It is by Christian Governments that "we are made as the
filth of the world, and as the offscouring of all things unto this day.' It is

commercial interests in the Empire of your oppressors be endangered, can-
not
regard you. It may be the dendifest scandal of Christendom that we
Christian Powers should be all gathered together, one against another, in the
Empire of your Oppressors, as eagles gather together round it carcase; but
really there is no help for it; and if you must die hidcously by a hellish
extermination, why then you must die, and we have to condone your hollish
extermination, for in any case, each one of us must secure his own political
and commercial interests in this same Empire of your Oppressors."
In 'Transcaucasia and Ararat," published by Mr. James Bryce in 1876,
there occurs in the chapter entitled Some Political Rellections" the follow-

and Bulgaria by the events of 1876 that the miseries of the Asiatic subjects
