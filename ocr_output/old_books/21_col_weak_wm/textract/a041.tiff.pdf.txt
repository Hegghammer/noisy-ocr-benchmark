Thus, near the end of last December, une of a century's greatest
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Chareh, and soul of the Armentan people-dowly
approaching to death, lay in the amcient monaster enlle Etchmiatzia, or" The this 1-Higrotten
is
Descendad." From the windew it a neighhoring youm he might have limked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now all wat close and buried for the
winter. Bevond the plain stool a dark mass of whirling suow and hurricane that hid the
cone of Ararat. And jnst herond Ararat lies Lake Vam, last puddle of the Delage. On the
shore of that lake, vears agn Khrimian was born. In 1820 the
Turkish
was still undiminished he senny land ; the Sultan still counted as one the formid)
abli Potrors of Europe. It was four vears before Beron set out to deliver firence from his
tyranny, and establiched for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom-
reputation which still rather patheticully surviver the Near East. Long and
storniy had been the life- whie in ibe Katholiko- now lucked back but not for

From bis carliest vears, when be bad witnessed the lerrors in Tarkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round Vrant, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality-such
a
spirit as only kindles in opperencent races, but dies into cassgoing toleramee annony the
prosporitime and contentel the world. He a poet, wanderiag far and wide
the Turkish, Persian, and Bassian sections of Irmenia, visiting Constantinople and Jernsalen,
and recalling to bis people he his poems the seenes and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastie order after his be devined the building of schont
which be generonsly threw open to Kurd- the hereditary assassins of Armentans. For many
years, while Earopo Was necupied with Jrimean wars, Austrian wars, or Freneb and German
wars, we see him readelesh journeying from Van (i) and through the
cities of Asia, unvielding in thongh continnally defeated, his schools burned, his
printing presces broken lip, his saered emistens of the 11.0-1 bung in mockery romul the neeks

But the oup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitition shaghter of Bulgations and
Armenians alike Was morethan European Porrers coulth-tand With varied motives,
Russia sent her armics to tight their way to the walls of and Khrimian famd

speaks 110 language but Armetian and Tarkish, he visited all the great courts of Enrope

done with saccess for the Lebamon. In London he hecamit acquainted with Gladstone bat
