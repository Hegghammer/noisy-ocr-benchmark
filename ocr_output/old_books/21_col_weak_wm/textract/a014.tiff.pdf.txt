SCENE OF THE MASSACRES IN ASTA MINOR.
The tronble began in Adana. An arned mah Strongthenel and auginented by soldiers
foll in overwheluning numbers upon the narmed Christians. The Armenian population of
Antioch and vicinity were practically wiped out and the Armenian villages in the
Alexandretta district destroyed with immense loss of life. Hadjim, Kessab and the beigh-
bouring villages were burned. The Armenian in Tarsus was rnined and ill-omenel
Marash stained again with the blood of thousands of Armenians. Zeitoon was desolated. The
entire popalation of Kirikon between Aleppo and Alexandretta were massacred to the last
babe. The moh and the soldiers burned what they coald not away, SO that the material
loss has been enormous. In place of the former abundance and thriving industries there are
instead desolated provinces and the charred and blackend remains of pillaged and ruined
homes, and the residue of those who escaped massaere are redueed to homelessness and
starvation.
