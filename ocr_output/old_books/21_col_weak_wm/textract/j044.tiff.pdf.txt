SEAT WEAVING
erally fit the pliable spline, allow it to dry, and then insert it with
the webbing. This assures tight joints. This procedure is not
recommended for the ordinary shops for the simple reason that the
shrinkage is not appreciable.
The frame illustrated in Fig. 35 is purely supplementary to the
steps, but as with the Seyen Steps in Caning, it should be used in
demonstrating the processes to classes. It materially assists in mak-
ing the processes clear to the students, previous to allowing work
un their projects, and assures a general understanding, at least, of
proper procedure. The different panels are lettered for convenience
and need no elaborate explanation
A is the open frame with grooves cut for the webbing.
B is the webbing inserted with ragged rdges exposed, ready for
cutting.
C is the webbing with edges properly trimmed and a spline in-
serted.
D is the completed panel.
Inserts of cane webbing may be utilized on pieces of furniture
other than seats. These inserts could be used on every article illus-
trated in Chapters I and II, with similar pleasing effects, and with
less labor. However, there is an obvious element in hand caning
which naturally and logically gives it precedence over the inserted
cane.
