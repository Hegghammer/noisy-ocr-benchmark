them to Liberty. Wolves were seen on the way near Parkesville.
He arrived at Liberty Falls-salted his sheep in the evening. The
next morning the sheep were gone, and Isanc and his son Roy, went
up the hill nt Liberty Falls to look for them. Before they got berond
the clearing they fomd dead sheep scattered along the log fence, and
others dying. Nearly all the flock were killed. They even killed a
lamb in the pen adjoining the house.
