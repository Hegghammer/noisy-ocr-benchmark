MORE \BOUT THE (11.1) HOUSE.
It will be seen by the engraving that the old house is domble. The
western part is that which was built by Barnabas in 1652-60. The
enst or two story part was built by Jonathan 1., about 1682. The apper
room of this part was used for a court house for hearly tifienty years,
as we learn from Thompson's History of Long Island. and some of
the old benches used when it was a court-house are sull preserved.
The old "castle," as Jonathan Gr. Horton. its last Horion occupant,
used to call it, is in all probability the oldest wood house in America.
I know of no dwelling house of any kind, stone or brick, now stand-
ing, that can date back as far as this veherable old mansion. There
were a few huts on the east of Long previous to 16.10-two or
three it is said on Shelter Island. Bmt these, as well as those built by
the Paritans, immodiately on their seitlement in Southold, soon all
passed away. Not a vestigt of any of the first generation baildings
ean be It remained for the house that Barnabas
built to survive the wreck of ages, and to stand to-day as a noble
representative of the of two hundred and fifteen vears ago.
Bot the old house stands to-lay not only as peering above all others
by its age, but also by its occapance. It is not very often that we find
tivo generations of the same name. living and d ring in thesame house
rarely find three. But here we have six Cenerations in succession, all
bearing the Horton name, living and dying in the same house, and
all born in it except Barnabas I., and his son Jonathan. We may
go
to the castles and palaces of the old world, and search long and dili-
gently, and fail to find a parallel case.
With a few repairs, the old castle may yet stand for generations far
in the future.
It requires some thonght and reflection to realize the lapse of time
since the old house was built. Sec the old Puritan himself there
twenty years; then his son Jonathan, twenty-eight years and then
Jonathan, Jr., about sivty years; and next Lawrence and his son Jona-
