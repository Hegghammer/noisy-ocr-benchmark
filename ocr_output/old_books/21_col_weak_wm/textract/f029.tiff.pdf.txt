CAPTAIN ALEXANDER SMITH
II
mised to steal for you." The delighted recipient
thought how exquisitely his customer's kindness
and humour blended.
There is nothing neater in all the history of
highwaymen than this ancedote, twinkling brightly
amid the matter-of-fact records of a degenerate
day.
There is plentiful evidence that when Captain
Alexandor Smith in 1719-20 wrote and published
his work upon the highwaymen and other ovil-
doers, he based his book upon the many chap-
books and broadsides then in existence Many
of them may even now be found by those who
do not mind searching for them, but whether
they will repay the troublé is quite another
matter. He includes in his gallery even Robin
Hood and Sir John Falstalt ; and, not concerned
to point out their legendary or merely literary
character, gives aun exact (though necessarily not
a truthful) biography of each.
Several clitions of Smith exist; some in three,
others in two volumes. The title-pages vary
largely, but all are extremely lengtby, and SO
curious that it is well worth while to reproduce
one as on the next page.
Captain Alexander Smith took an immense
delight in his villains. You cannot fail to per-
ceive, if you read his book, that his only contempt
was for a bungler in the art. Royalist to the
heart's core of him, he expends his most loving
labours upon the freebooters who displayed his
own political bias, and there can be little doubt
