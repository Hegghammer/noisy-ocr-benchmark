It is not known from what place in England either Thomas or Jere:
miah came, nor is there any certain evidence that they were brothers
of Barnabes, bnt the three roming ove: about the same time would
favor the tradition that they were brothers.
The llead Quarters of Ciesar's ammy was near the present

known there to the remotest period of any authentic records. This
