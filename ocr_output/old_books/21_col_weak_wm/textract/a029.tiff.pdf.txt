PART I.
THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OI BERLIN.
Since the gathering of the Plenip cotentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 18+8, and the signing of the still more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll oi the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel in history.
In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 18+S. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powcrful Governments of Europe,
but in the interests of I Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).
I: was il curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of "the
terrible stronghold of Kars,' universally admitted to be one of the greatest
and most difficult military exploits ever achieved, and the crowning success
of the Russian arms in Asiatic Turkey, should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General ; that althou in \rmenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest, and Armenian soldiers fought, conquered and
died, yet by these successes not only was no amelioration attained of the
hard late of their unhapps nation under Turkish rile, but that fate, hard
before, was made a hundrediold and even it thousandfold harder.
