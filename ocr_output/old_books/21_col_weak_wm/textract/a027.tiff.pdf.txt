was a race that cimo amolg non-Moslen peoples which with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ditoman fatherland that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who sperk and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman commtry as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engage in
commerce and agrienture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase the value of
the Ottoman Empire. Recause it tew among them justly started un agitation, these nur noble

This shocking crime of Yibiz formed 11 deep lake of blood, and this lacke, during the
whole course of a cursed absolatism, up to the last moment, grew wider. Even during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feelings which been shown,
the awind erents in Adama took place and the souls of all trae Osmanlis mehed into tears.
Up to the present time the deep prrow exused I's this event has not disappearol, because this
bloody wound in our social camnot ensily be eutred. While We till ettr stomachs with
cholce morsels, while We rest selfishly in our comfortable bad ilese fatherless and brotherless
orphans, widows humgry, naked, and harefoot wander hicher and thither, and thousands of
families are fleeing from the tatherland. We are convinced that the povernatent is doing its
work, but what has happenel is so great : calamity that it enn keep it government hnst for
vears. However much sucritice we make, still it will be inadequate, because the
happiness of the fatherland depend on bealing such bloud wounds as iliese as soon ils possible.
We are convineed that the government andal onnected with it are persuado of this as well as
onrselves. We must BOW wipcont the mistortune brought by il enrsed period.
We must now comfort weeping hearts. Wemust understand and teach those who do not

nation is under obligations to protedt this race, Incounse the liberty We enjoy to-day
is in large part the to the short by the We thought that these truths
were so obvious that we preferred (o keep silence, whereas to-day we understand the it is
necessary from time to time 10 recall the greainess of ontr obligation. We must not forget
that this unhapps people up 10 yesterday has endared only barbarism, and for twelve vears
has been constantly oppressed and gromd to the carth, and has given thousands of vietims.
Hereafter We: must work to assure them that the ona nf massaeres has passed, and with all our
strength of mind and soul we must quiet them. The obligation of the government 10 protect
them is also very heavy, becanse our Armenian comptrymen live among wandering tribes.
We must all assist the sovernment ind point out its oblication. Ii be dechared in
public and periodically that theone of the most important duties of the Ottoman nation is to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and property of the
Annenians 85 rell, since these are their sacred rights. Let investigations be made and let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim."
This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare disclose
his identity ; and the account given by an authority like Mr. James Bryce
surely refate the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as 'les Massacres occasionnés par les aventuriers Arméniens."
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
