of blackened roins, the stark walls of the churehos and honses rishing of the a-hes and
charred timbers heaped on very side. What mist it mean to the five thousand meil and
women and little chüldren who have survived a tlight to the seacoast and have now
returned to their mountain home, only to tind their houses sacked and burned There were
nine Christian villages which clustered abont Kessab in the valley below. Several of these
have been complately destroved by lire. All have been plundered and the helpless people
driven ont or slain."
" Can vou imagine the feeliness of the Kessah people as therdinted on foot the long trail
the monntain, and then as they came over the ridge into fill view oftheir charred and
ruined dwellings Their stores of wheat, tharley and rice had been burned elothing, anking
utensils, durniture and tool- had gone; their geals, cows and mule- had been stolen their sill
industries stamped ont their bcloved charches redmeed to smouldering heaps. The bodics of
their friends and relatives who land been killed had not been buried. And vet the love of
home is so trong that the people have >citled down there with the determination to clear up
the debri- and rebnild their honses. from " The Sack of Kessab," Stephen Van R.

As these sheets are going through the press there comes news of famine
05th
at Zeitoon. The Rev. F. W. Macullum, American Missionary at Marash,
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet, American Missionary at Constantinople, that
12,000 souls in and around Zeitoon are dying of bunger they are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran and water, and cooking and eating it, if they can
get even that, Rev. Macullum adds, The same story comes to us from all
sides. its we foresaw all along, from now on the distress will be greatest.
If 50,000 were massacre 1, the list of those who have died and are dying
of homelessness and starvation will exceed 1 50,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerated. Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.
The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered in a nightattack
by armed Kurds, and the villagers are now reduced to extreme distress. Before
the outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeatedly appealed
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec-
tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It is
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
