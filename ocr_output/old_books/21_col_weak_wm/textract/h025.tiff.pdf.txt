NOTE.
The reader will see ai a glance the plan of this book. We com-
mence with the Christian name. Then follows the parentage, genea-
logical dain, Sc., and then the Christian names of : children and
order of births. In many of the early families the exact order of
births canno: be ascertained; but it has been approximated as mearly
us possible. The lineage is given in connertio with the firs: member
of the family. The Roman numerals indicate the order of births.
The sons and daughters of the oid Puritan, Barnahas, constitate the
second generation, but they are spoker. by way of eminence as Joseph
I., Hannah I., Stc. The book contains much repetition, but none
too much to make it plain and casy to sady.
This little book contains the chronicles of only about one-half of
the Horton families louked up. Those whose genealogical data are
given only in a small part. and those whose correct lineage has not
been satisfactorily ascertained, are not included in this book.
