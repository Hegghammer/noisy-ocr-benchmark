Church, but was also a fearless patriot-a distinguished linguist, an eloquent preacher, and a
thorough gentleman in overy sense of the word. When peace was concluded between Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the feared fanatical aprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history,
At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nercès, the Patriarch, their object being to request the signatory Powers of
the Berlin Treaty to force a guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.
Abdul Hamid and his advisers were furions at this affront, and Monseigneur Nercès was
summoned to the Palace, It is said that when he received the summons he simply smiled
and asked one of of his curates to read the Burial Service to him, as he did not expect to
return alive. However, he went. No one has ever heard what passed between the Sultan
and himself at the interview; suffice it to say that he immediately summoned the Armenian
General Assembly and rendered his resignation. This was not accepted by the Assembly,
and, amidst enthusiastic cheers, he was carried back to his apartments at the Patriarchate.
Meanwhile a peremptory order reached him, signed by the Sultan, to recall the Armenian
delegation from Berlin, This Monseigneur Varjabétian point-blank refused to do, and retired
to his private residence at Huskeny, a village on the Golden Horn. The success of the dele-
gation, however, did not come up to his expectations. The Armenians, as it happened, could
not be heard, bat they were so far successful as to have an article inserted in the treaty.
The Sultan and his advisers never forgave the Patriarch this, though they could not
openly do anything to him on account of his enormous popularity. Time passed on, and to
all appearance the incident was forgotion, but it was not so, One summer afternoon a most
cordial invitation was sent by a very high dignitary of the Palace, requesting the Archhishop
to dine with him informally. An invitation of this kind could not very well be refused, so
the Archbishop, accompanied only by a body-servant named Vartan, repaired to the Pasha's
house. The Pasha received him at the door and escorted the visitor with much ceremony and
extreme courtesy to a private apartment of the salamlik of his house (the men's quarters),
where dinner was served. The geniality displayed by his host dispelled any fears that the
Archbishop might have had as to his personal safety.
After dinner, as usual, coffee was served. Now, this serving of the coffee is rather a
ceremonial according to high Turkish etiqueue, and it is not unusal for guests to bring their
own tehooboakdar (the servant who carries his master's pipe and pouch and also superintends
the making his collee). The Archbishop was presented with a "tehoobouk” (pipe) filled
and lighted for smoking, and a servant followed with coffee. The Archbishop accepted hath
with due compliments to his host, and took a sip at his coffee. Just at that moment the
heavy curtains over the doorway were thrown apart, revealing the glastly pale face of his
servänt Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, în a voice trembling with emotion, "Monseigneur,
E did no brew the coffee !"
This was enough for the Archbishop; he pretended to be startled and spilt the coffee, but,
alas! he had already drank a small quantity of it. Meanwhile a scufile was going on behind
the portière, where his poor servant Vartan was paying the penalty of his devotion to his
master. Concerning Vartan's whereabouts of his ultimate end nothing was ever made public
the poor fellow simply vanished. Monseigneur Varjakútian, after a short interval thanked
the Pasha for his generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
was taken violently ill and a dector was hustily summoned. The Patriarch took to his bed,
and lost all his hair through the effects of the poison. Then, one morning, when a servant
