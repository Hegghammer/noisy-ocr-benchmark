called a powerful nation. For almost as long they have possessed no independent country of
their own. For six hundred years their ancient capital city of Auf his stood a splendid but
empty ruin in the desert between Kars and the great mountain of Alag√∂z, which confronts
Ararat, with nearly equal height. They have been rent asunder and formented by Persians,
Tarks, Tartars, and Russians in turn. Even their religion is not nationalistic of distinctly
separate from other forms of religion, like the Jewish. Except for metaphysical shades of
difference, hardly comprehensible to the modern world, there is little to distinguish it from the
orthodox Christianity of the Near East. Yet, through innumerable disasters and attempts
at extermination, the race persists, like the Jews, with astonishing vitality, ummistakable in
characteristics which may not be exactly heroic, but lead to a certain material success, After
all, it is only in barnssed and perseented nationalities that trae patriotism ever survives.
