Proface. Introduction,
It is said that Barnabas Horton I, was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities.
His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton,
It is elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. The original base was of brick, but it had all crumbled down
many years ago. The present base was pour under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G, Horton.
The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads as
follows:
Here Hath buried the body of MR. BARNABAS HORTON, who was born at
Monsuly, Leicestershire, Old England, and died at Soutboll, on he 13th day of
July, 1680, ague So years.”
In the centre of the stone we find the Epitap
as follows:
- Here lies my baly tombol
with the just;
My soni ascende lu de drone of Chod,
Where with sweet Lew How I make abode:
Then hasten after nie, my dearest wife,
To be partaker of this blessed life
An lyon, dear childhon, all follow the Lord,
Hear and obey His public stered word;
And in your homses cal' upou His name,
For off have advised you to the same:
Then God will these you with your children af,
And in this Blessed pleae He wil” you call."

Huh, xi : 4.-“He being deal, yet sperketh,”
It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the original
thirteen who brought his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and memory
should not perish from the earth.
