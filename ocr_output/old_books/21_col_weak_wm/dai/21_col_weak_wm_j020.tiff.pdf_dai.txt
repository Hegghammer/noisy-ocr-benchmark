After the area is caned the strips are fitted and glued in. Use little
glue. Tap the splines firmly with a mallet used over a block of
wood, until they are flush with the woven cane. Chapter IV give
the method in detail.
The size of the holes and the distance between them is deter-
mined largely by the size of the
cane used. Some prefer coarse
meshed areas, while others desire
them closely woven. There is,
however, what we may term a
standard mesh. The individual
may vary the dimensions given to
suit himself. The Jacobean or
early caning was invariably of
coarse mesh.

A small amount of medium binder is desirable.
One hank of cane will ordinarily be sufficient for a half-dozen
areas of approximately 12 in. by 12 in.

particularly narrow split horizontally and vertically, and a wider
split diagonally. The opposite practice may be employed-a finer
split of cane being used diagonally than horizontally and vertically.
Both effects are pleasing.
