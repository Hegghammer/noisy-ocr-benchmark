victims in thy Vildiz Niosk, found its way to thy treacherous heart. No
poisoned cup of cofice like the countless cups brewed in thy palaces trickled
down thy throat to end thy vampire existence.

Thou hast lived! Protected from the Nemesis of thy erimes by the
jealousies and rivalries of great powers which thou artfully played one against
another ; by the combined forces of religion and plinder which thou cunningly
wielded into ene. Even so thou livest! Peerless Hving example in the
civilized twenticth century of the Triumph of Crime.

TPAWVIENTHR.

Tn the forecoing paves I have directed my humble efforts to sketch out
what the Powers of urope have done in the past, and how their actions
have reilected on my unfortunate race.

It is considered good poliey now by a certain class of Nuropean writers
to ascribe all the horrors of the Armenian Massacres to Tlaiid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as toassailable and unconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as a sort of superhuman being who swept cverything
before him to the consummation of his own despotic will The reason for
this is not diffeult to perceive. They would fain disavow the part Europe
has played in the tragedy, and to do this successfully it becomes necessary
also to present Vurkey to the world now as a paradise (from whence the
tyrant once removed) peopled only hy saints and angels; so we have also
many roseate colored word pictures of Constitmdonal Vurkey.

Vhe murders, deportations and imprisonments of the Vurkish revolu-
tionaries, or more correctly reformers, were undoulitedly the sole work of
Abdul Hamid and his palace clique, but Abdul and his imintons couid not
have carried ont that hellish work of wholesale extermination of the
Armenians without the perpetration and participation of the Turkish

people. It is trne the massacres were originated and organized in the
Palace, the Palace clique stirrcd up religious fanaticism and race hatred, but
the co-operation of the people was necessary ; and the people co-operated
in order to plunder and enrich themselves with the worldly goods that the
Anmenians always knew how to acquire by their own industry and toil; the
appeal to their marauding and bestial instinets met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work fora race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
