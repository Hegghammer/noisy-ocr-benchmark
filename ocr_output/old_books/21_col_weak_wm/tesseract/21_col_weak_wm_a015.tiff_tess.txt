DISINTERNIESTEID WVEDIENCT:.
Thave thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested witnesses.

“Woare havin a perfoedy hideous time here, Thousand: have been murdered— 25,000
in thts province they say; but the number is trahably ereater, for every Christian villaze
was wiped vot Tn Adana about 5000 ave perished After Turks and Armeniuis lad
made peace, tle Lurks came ia the miht with bose and kercagene, and -ut fire to what remained
ofthe Armenian quarter. Next day che French and Armenian schools wore fired. Nearly every-
one in the Armenian school perished, anybody trying to eseape being shot down by thesaldiers.”

'Vho Turkish Authorities do nothing oxeept arrest unotlinding Armenians, froin whont
by torture they extort the most fanciful contesgious.  Eyen the wounded are not sefe from
their injustice. A man was being carried in tome yesterday when he was seized and taken
ote esol, J dare not think what his tate may be.

“Por fends incarnate cominend me tothe Lurks. Nobody is safe from them. They
murder babies in front of their mothers: they halfioarder meen, and vielate the wives while
the husbands are Tying there dying in pouls ot bloud.”

“Phe antiorities dich nothing, aud the soldiers were worse than the crowd, for they were
better armed. One house in car yaarter was burned with 215 people iside. We ecunted :
the bodies. The subliers set fire to the door, andl as the windews had iron bars, nobody
contd get ont. Everybody in the house was roasted alive. ‘They were all women and
children and old people Extract trom letter of Mrs, Donghty-Wylie, wife of Britieh Consul
