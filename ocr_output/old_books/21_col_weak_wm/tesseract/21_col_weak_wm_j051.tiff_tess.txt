those at d and #, and these repeat themselves indefinitely ac each
corner, or until the seat is completed. This applies to square seats
only. “Phe end of the last strand may be secured with a tack under
the proper rail, or twisted around a strand underneath the seat.

The strand is twisted as the weaving progresses. This may te
dane with the palm of the hand and thigh, in much the same man-
ner as a shoemaker waxes his thread. If one leat of rush is used to
iake the strand, new leaves are added by tying the two ends ina
square knot at a corner, or wherever such joining will not show on
the finished seat. When more than ene piece of rush is used for a
strand the pieces shauld be of uneven lengths initially. One leaf or
piece at a time is then added. “he upper or top end of the leaf is
used to begin rhe seating and each deaf added is attached at its top

Some expert rush seaters do not tie knots in making strands, but
add leaves by twisting the end of the preceding leaf about the added.

marked. Adding by twisting only is difficult, and requires great
patience and dextrous handling of the material. In fact rush
should be used by the more skilfid boys only. Others may use the
excellent substitute, Aber.
