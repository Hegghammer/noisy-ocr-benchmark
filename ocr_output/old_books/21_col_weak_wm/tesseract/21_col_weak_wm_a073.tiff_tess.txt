«(God shall colaree Japhet and he shall dwell i the tents of Shem, and
Canaan shall be his servant.”

Por the interpretation of this blessing of Noah's to bis cidest son, and
of how it may or may not have met with its falniment, | shall icave to

Tradition has woven a romance round the names of towns and villages
