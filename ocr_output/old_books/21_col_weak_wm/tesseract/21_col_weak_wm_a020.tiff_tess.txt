smell of corpses is in the air, the odor from the carcases of the ‘christian
swine” reek in the nostrils of the Turk, he turns away, his jaws dripping with
blood, and rests to couch for a future spring. \Ve have seen that sort of an
end to the tragedy ofa tiger’s victim: the tiger has caten his fill, he rests,
to keep cuard over the crunched bones and mangled hits of bloody flesh that
bestrew the earth. So also now there is a residue left of those that have
served es the meat and wine of this devil’s feast ; the demons have gorged
themselves over the banquet, and now there are left over the broken remains

slaughter and oppression of a helpless christian race should cease. Would
to God I entreat, ye would raise up your voices and demand that this people
of an industrious, tatelligent christian race, robust in mind and body, should
be let to live. Would to God I cntreat, that ye would raise up your voices
and demand for them that security of life and property to which they are
entitled just as cqually as all other peoples.

Public Sentiment has done ereat things in the world’s history. Public
Sentiment liberated Greece, The Lebanon, The Balkan States from Turkish
Oppression. Slavery was abolished in the United States through Public
Sentiment: but alas! does Public Sentiment sleep tor this helpless Christian
