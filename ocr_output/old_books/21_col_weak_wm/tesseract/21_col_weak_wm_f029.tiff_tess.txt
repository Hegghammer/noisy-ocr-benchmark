CAPTAIN ALEXANDIER SMITH iI
mised to steal for you.” The dehehted recipient
thonght how exquisitely his customer’s kindness
and humour blended.

There is nothing neater im all the history of
highwaymen than this ancedote, twinkling brightly
amid the matter-of-fact records of a degenerate
day.

There is plentiful evidenee that when Captain
Alexander Smith in 1719-20 wrote and published
his work upon the highwaymen and other evil-
doers, he based his book upon the many chap-
books and broadsides then in existence. Many
of them may even now be found hy those who
do not mind searching for them, but whether
they will repay the trouble is quite another
matter. die ineludes in his @allery even Robin
Hood and Sir John Falstall; and, not concerned
to point out their legendary or merely literary
character, gives an exact (though necessarily not
a truthful) biography of each.

Several editions of Smith exist; some in three,
others in two volumes. The title-pages vary
largely, but all are extremely lengthy, and so
curious that it is well worth while to reproduce
one as on the next page.

Captain Alexander Smith took an immense
delight in his villains. You cannot fail to per-
ceive, if vou read his book, that bis only contempt
was for a bungler in the art. Royalist to the
heart’s core of him, he expends his most loving
labours upon the freebooters who displayed his
own political bias, and there can be little doubt
