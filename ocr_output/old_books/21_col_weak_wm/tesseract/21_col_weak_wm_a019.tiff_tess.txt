INTRODUCTION
TO 2sp PRINTING,

My object in writing this littl book ts to Jay the hard case et my un-

the sulphur flames of religious fanaticism burst, the lava floods of race hatred
and Just of phinder, break forth and run in fiery streams; the untortunate
victims are pounced upon, swooped upon, pillaged, plundered, butchered,
slaughtered, subjected to outrages so hideous, cruel, loathsome, and revolt-
ing, that no pen could depict their horrible realities and the details can never
go into print. The human mind is stageered and asks itself the question if
even the imaginations of fiends and devils could originate such horrors.
Then this orgy of the hnman fiends is arrested. Vor the time being the
appetite for blood, lust, and plunder is satisfied ; for the tame being, the eye
