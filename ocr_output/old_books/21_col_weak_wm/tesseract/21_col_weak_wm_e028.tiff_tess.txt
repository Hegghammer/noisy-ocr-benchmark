The Persians entertain much the same notions with regard to the |
| necessity for slendermess of form in the belles of their nation, but ditter in
other matters from the Hindoos. ‘The following Wlustration represents a |
dancing-girl of Persia, and it will be scen that her figure bears no
| indication of neglect of cultivation, It is somewhat curious that the |
| Chinese, with all their extraordinary ingenuity, have confined their |
restrictive efforts to the feet of the ladies, Jeaying their waists unconfined.

' "That their doing so is more the result ef long-established custom than
| absence of admiration for elegantly-proportioned figures will be clearly |
| proved by the following extract from a letter published in Chamber? |

| named Woo-tan-zhin, who paid a visit to England in 1844-45. Thus |
he describes the ladies of England :— i
| «Their eyes, having the bine tint of the waters of autumn, are |
| charming beyond description, and their waists are laced as tight and thin
| as a willow branch. What, perhaps, canght my fancy most was the
sight of clegantly-dressed young ladies, with pearllike necks and tight. |
© laced waists; nothing can possibly be so enchanting as to sce ladies that
| compress themselves into taper forms of the most exquisite shape, the |
| like of which TI have never seen before.”
By many writers it has been urged that the admiration so generally |
| felt for slenderly-proportioned und taper waists results from an artificial |
| taste set up by long custom; tut in Woo-tan-zhin’s case it was
| clearly not so, as the small-waisted young ladies of the “outer
barbarians” were to him much as some new and undescribed flowers or |
birds would be to the wondering naturalist who first beheld them.

Although researches among the antiqnitics of Egypt and Thebes
failto bring to our notice an article of dress corresponding with the
waist-bandage of Polengui or the strophium of later times, we find
