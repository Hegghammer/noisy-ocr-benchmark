moved, about two feet deep. He had a large stock of cows, sheep and
hogs. In his flock of sheep were twenty-two ewes, the finest that eould be
found in Colchester, nearly all of them only two years old. He ilrove
them to Jiberty. Wolves were seen on the way near Parkesville.
He arrived af Liberty Falls—salted his sheep in the evening. The
next morning the sheep were gone, and [Isaac and his son Roy, went
up the hill at Liberty L’alls to look for them. Before they got beyond
the clearing they found dead sheep seattered along the log fence, and
others dying. Nearly all the flocs were killed. ‘They even killed a
lamb in the pen adjoining the house,

Tn 1837, Isaac Horton had thirty-seven grandchildren, all living
but two. His children all bved to maturity.’ —! Letter Go 1. Herter,
