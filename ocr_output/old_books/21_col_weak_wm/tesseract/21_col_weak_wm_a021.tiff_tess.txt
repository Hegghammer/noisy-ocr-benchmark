earth as other nations? Does Humanity, docs Christianity allow that tender
babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and butchered
before the eyes of their mothers, or that the cars of mothers should be rent
with the cries of the dying agony of their murdered children? Does
Humanity, does Christianity allow that helpless women should he forcibly
subjected to the most hideons, the most loathsome, the most revolting, and
the most crucl ontraves? Does Humanity, docs Chrisdianity, allow all this?

| Christian Governments have organized a Hague Conference of Peace
and Civilization, but they have. closed its doors to the cause of a bleeding
christian race groaning under the yoke of the cruellest oppressors Uhat the
world has yet known. Christian mea and wamen have held up their hands
