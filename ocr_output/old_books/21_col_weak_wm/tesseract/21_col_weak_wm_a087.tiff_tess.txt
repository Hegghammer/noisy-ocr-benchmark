Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have clung to their christian faith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure.

Vhe cathedral of letchmiatzin built by Grevory still stands to-day ; it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, until perhaps
little of the original building may be left, bat ic still claims to be the church
built by the patron saint of Armenia, IT shall here quote a passage from
“Historical Sketch of the Armenian Choreh,” written by an Armenian
prest :

‘Owing to political circumstances the Armenian Patriarchate had at
umes to be transferred to metropolises and to other principal towns of
Armenia. In the year A.D. p32 it was removed to Dwin, in 993 to Ani,
in r144 to Romklah, and in 1294 to Sis. The Ningdom of Cilicia becoming
extinet, and, we having no more a kingdom and no longer a capital town, it
was natural and proper to re-transfer the See to its own ortginal place, as
the entire nation unanimously desired it. Accordingly, in the year r441, it

» was decided by an ecclesiastical] meeting that the seat of the Catholicus should
return to Tloly Ptchmiatzin, where to this day has been preserved the
proper unbroken succession from our Apostles and from cur holy Mather,
St. Gregory the Hluminator.”

I read the other day in one of the foreign papers published in Japan,
the following piece of news : ;

“Aa Armenian Church pronounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christian cra, has been discovered ina fair state of preserva-
tion in the neighbourheod of Bash-Aparnah.”

Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light on Armenian history.
