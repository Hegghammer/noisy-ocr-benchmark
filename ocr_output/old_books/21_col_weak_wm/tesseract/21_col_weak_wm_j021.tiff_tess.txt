CANING SUGGESTIONS 4F
holes are bored and ‘utilized in rhe cane weaving. These are not
absolutely necessary; in fact caned areas on many pieces of period
and modern furniture do not utilize cormer holes. In such instances
two diagonal strands are rma in each hole on either side of the
corner. A comparison of the areas, the one employing a corner
hole, and the other not, will lead the observer to conclude that the
turmer appears complete while the latter appears unftaished.

Wherever it is found desirable to leave cane natural, it is neces-
sary that the frame be stained before caning is begun. Box fuming
will not perinanently color cane. Oil stains make no appreciable
impression Uf rubbed off at once. But water, acid, and alcohol
stains produce decided colors. Tf the worker destres to color the
cane approximately the same shade as the article, the caning may
be done on the white wood and the entire article stained at the one
operation, Cane may be shellacked or varnished or left natural, ,
as desired.
