| British Museum bears on it the strange and anomalous figure represented
: in the annexed illustration. Opinions vary somewhat as to whether
its origin might not have been Ttalian, but we see no reason for adopuug |
this view, and consider it as of decidedly home production. It will be
| seen that the shoulder, upper part of the arm, and figure are those of a
well-formed female, who wears an unmistakable corset, tightly laced, and !
| stitfened by two busks in front, from one of which the Jace, with a tag
at the end, depends. The head, wings, tail, feet, and claws are all those
of a demon or fiend. The drapery is worn so long as to render large
knots in it requisite to prevent dragging on the ground. The ring held
in the Icit claw is of gold, and probably intended to represent a massive
and costly bracelet. Produced, as ths MIS. appears to have been,
durmg the reign of Edward the Confessor, there is little doubt that
it was a severe monkish satire on the prevailing fashion, and a most
uneallant warning to the mule sex that alabaster shoulders and slender
waists Were too often associated with attributes of a rather brimstone
; character, and that an inordinate love of long, trailing garments and
ornaments of precious metals were snares and enticements of a sinister
| nature. Many of the figures to be found on ancient MSS. after this
period show by their contour that the corset was worn beneath the
drapery, and Strutt, whose work was published in 1706, thus writes of i
the customs relating to dress in the period following shortly after :—“In |
| the thirteenth century, and probably much prior to that period, a long |
| and slender waist was considered by our ancestors as a criterion of
| elegance in the female form, We ought not, therefore, to wonder if it
| be proved that the tight lacing and compressing of the body was
practised by the ladies even in carly times, and especially by sneh
_ of them as were inclined to be corpulent.” Te then, in order to |
show at vhat an carly date of the history of this country a confirmed |
taste for small waists existed, quotes from a very ancient poem, entitled |
Launfal, in which the Lady 'Triamore, daughter of the King of the |
