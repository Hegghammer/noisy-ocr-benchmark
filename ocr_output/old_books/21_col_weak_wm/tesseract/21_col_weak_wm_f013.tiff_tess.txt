PREFACE ix

Bost of us like to keep a few of the illusions

we beliered in when schoolboys.  Seientific his-

{ torians have degraded many of our aneient heroes

end evelted the villains, for whom of old no

mud was too thick and slob. Beliefs are being

assitiled on every side. Vo abolish the truditional

courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the considerate

comduct of Cuptein Lind would, therefore, be

strokes of the unkiudest, und £ have here atlempted

no such ieonoclasm. Leen where 1 cannot be-

lieve, I hace told the tule-—ihenecer id hus been

worth the telling-—-as it is found in criminal

trials, or tn Smith or Sohusen, and other old

sources, dccorously stripped of much nile lingeage.

For really, where much that seems incredible

may be fully proved, and where the believable

fnrus out rot rerely to be false, tis your only wey.

Lo continue the story of the highwaymen from

Smith wud Johnson down to the approaching end

of all such things in the beginning of the nine-

teenth century, is like taking up and concluding

a healfetold tule. But it was worth the doing.

Only in respect of the great figure Turpin hus

always nude, has it been found really necessary

to seriously consider and rve-state the career of

thut much-overrated scoundrel, and to put him

in his proper pluce: a very much lower one
than he usually oceupies.
