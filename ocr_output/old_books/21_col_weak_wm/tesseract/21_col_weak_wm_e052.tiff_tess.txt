| 46 THE CORSET AND ‘THE CRINOLINE, 7
|
“lrem: Pro ix ulnis radii, Paricnsis pro robas astivas corsetto et clochia |

pro eodem,” *
| The persons for whom these garments were made were Richard, |
| King of the Normans, and Edward, his son, whose death occurred in the i
year 1308. So that corsets werc, even in those carly days, used by | i
gentlemen as well as ladies,
The term kirtke, so often referred to, may not clearly convey to the |
mind of the modern reader the nature of the garment indicated by it,
| and therefore it may not be amiss to give Strurt’s description of it. He
says, The kirtle, or, as it was anciently written ¢derfcly Is 2 part of the
| dress used by the men and the women, but especially by the latter. It
| was sometimes a habit of state, and worn by persons of high rank.” The
carment sometimes called a “surcol” Chauccr renders dirtle, and we
have no reason to dispute his authority. Kirtles are very frequently
mentioned in old romances, ‘They are said to have been of different
textures and of different colours, but especially of green; and sometimes
| they were laced closely to the body, and probably answered the purpose
of the bodice or stays—-wide Launfal, before referred to :—
“ Their kirtles were of rede cendel, |
I laced smialle, jolly’, and well.” |
: To appear ina kirtle only seems to have been a mark of servitude.
| Thus the lady of Sir Ladore, when he feasted the king, by way of |
' courtesy waited at the table— |
“The lady was gentyll and small, |
Tn Kirtle alone she served in hall,’ |
| We are farther informed that at the close of the fifteenth century it

was used as a habit of penance, and we read that Jane Shore, when
performing penance, walked barefoot, a lighted taper in her hand, and
| * Ttem: For nine clls, Paris measure, for summer robos, corsets, and cloaks for the same.
