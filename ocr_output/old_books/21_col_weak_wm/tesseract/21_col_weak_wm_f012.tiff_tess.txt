vill PREFACE
from Smith, who himself was prone to tnelude
* the most ettravugunt myths in his puges, calls
his folio A GeNerAL AND ‘TRUE Ilistory oF
Tne Lives anp Acrions or THE Mosr Famous
UicuwayMen. Both of them inelude pirates und
murderers. Of the “truth” af mach in Smith
unt Johnson, the less said the better.

No one has ever reprinted those uuthors in
their original exrtranaganee, or their grossness.
Mi would be impossible ; and, if possible, il would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
them, or even written un independent history of
the highiwaymen. When we consider how astonish-
ingly popular those vremanees hace ever been
which have had Claude Du Vall, and Lurpin,
and their like for heroes, this is nob u little
SUPpPISing.

Perhaps the tusk kas been ubendoned because
of the diffieully—the almost insuperable difficulty
—of sifting fact from fiction, und becuuse of u
chilling sense that it would be « thankless lash
to present the highwayman as he really was: «a
Jellow rarely heroic, yenerally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No novelist would
be likely to thank the frunk historian for this dis-
service ; and 1 do nol think the historian who eume
to the subject in this cold scientific spiril of «a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
