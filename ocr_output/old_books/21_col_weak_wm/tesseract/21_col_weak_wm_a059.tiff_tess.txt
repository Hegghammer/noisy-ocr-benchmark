OUT OF THI DEPETtS.

“Oh thatiny head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that
[might weep day and night for the slain of my people.”

A book has been written and published in Japan, its tide “ Niku Dan”
translated into Tnglish, reads, “Tluman Bullets.” This little book, a
narrative of the sicge of Port Arthnr, after being read through the lenvth
and breadth of the empire, found translators to transiate it into the best
known of languages ; and its youns author, himsclf an actor in the siege,
was summoned to the presence of his sovercign to be thanked and praised.
The book is a vraphic narrative of the most terrible sicue in history, wherein
is vividly portrayed the deadly struggle of the besiegers. It contains as an
acknowledvement of its merit, a page on which is recorded the Ield
Marshal's appreciation, and another page bearing the Commanding General's -
commendation.

In simple narrative the author carries the: reader through appatiing
secnes of horror, and as we read we are made to realize the slaughter of
the enemy’s machine guns, of their ground-mines, clectric-wire entangle-
ments, and exploding shells; we are made to hear the roar of the artillery
tire dealing deatn and destruction, and there rises before us the mental viston
of the fierce hand to hand coutlict, and the dead and dying lying thickly tn
the dark ravine. ;

“Vor hill and battle plain,
With dying men and slain,
Grew mountain heights of pain,
And mine is boundless woe.”

Vhe grim warrior who stormed and took the most impregnable fortress
in the world eives expression to his feclings on his own great achievement,
in saddest words.

“And mine is boundless woe,”

Vor the grim warrior’s heart is elett in twain for the human builets that

under his command hurled themselves to their death.
