saddle their backs and straitlace their waists to make them well-shaped.

Strutt informs us that the Roman women, married as well as
unmarried, used girdles, and besides them they sometimes wore a broad
swath or bandage round their breasts, called strophium, which scems to
have answered the purpose of the bodice or stays, and hada buckle or |

| bandage on the left shoulder, and that the mitra or girdle of the Greeks |
| probably resembled the strophium of the Romans. The annexed
lustration represents a lady of Ancient Greece. He also speaks of
the Muses as being described by Tesiod as being girt with golden
“mitres,? and goes on to inform us that Theocritus in one of his
pastorals introduces a damsel complaining to a shepherd of his rudeness,
saying he had loosened her mitra or girdle, and tclls her he means to
~ dedicate the samc to Venus. So it will be seen that the waist and its
adorument were considered at that early period of the world’s history
matters of no ordinary importance, and whether the term strophium,
; zone, mitra, custula, stays, bodice, or corset is made use of, the end

sought to be obtained by their aid was the same.

Constant mention is made by early writers of the peplus as being a
very elegant garment, and there are notices of it as far back as the
Trojan war, and the ladics of Troy appear to have generally worn it.

On the authority of Strutt, it may be stated to have been “a thin light
mantle worn by Grecian ladies above the tnic;” and we read that
Antinous presented to Penelope a beautiful large and variegated
peplus, haymg twelve buckles of gold, with tongues neatly curved,

Tr he peplus, however, was a very splendid part of the lady’s dress, and
