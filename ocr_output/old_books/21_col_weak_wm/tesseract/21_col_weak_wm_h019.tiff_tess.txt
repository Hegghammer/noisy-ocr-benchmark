MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE.

hhowili be seen by the cnpraving that thie old) house ts domale. “The
western part is that which was built by Barnabas in 1659-60. ‘Vhe
east or two story part was built hy Jonathan 1, about 1682. 0 The apper
room ot this part was used for a court: house for nearly twenty years,
as we learn trom Vhompson’s History of Long Estland) and some of
the old benches used when tt was a conrt-house are still preserved.
The old “castle,” as Jonathan G. Morton, its last Morton occupant,
used to call it, isin all probability the oldest wood house my Amertea.
T know of no dwelling house of any kind, stone or brick, now stand-
ing, that can date hack as far as this venerable old mansion.  Vhere
were 2 few huts on the east of Long Island previous to 16.to—twe or
three it is suid on Shelter Island. But these, as well as those built by
the Paritans, inmediately on their settlement in Southold, soon all
passed away. Not 2 vestige of any of the first generation laildings
ean be found except this one. Tt remained for the house that Barnabas
built to survive the wreck of ages, ancl to stand: to-day as a noble :
representative of the ciwelings of two hundred and ifteon vears ago.
But the old house stands to-day not only as peering above all others
by its age, but also by tts occupancy. Tt is not very often that we find
iyo generations of the sane name, living and dying in the same house—
rarely find three. But here we have six generations in suceession, all
bearing the Horton name, living and dying in the same house, and
all born in it exeept Barnabas J., and his son Jonathan. We may 0
to the castles and palaces of the old world, ane search long and dili-
wently, and fail to find a parallel case.

With a few repairs, the old castle may yet stand for generations tar
in the future.

If requires some thought and reflection to realize the lapse of time
since the old house was built. Sec the old Puritan himself there
twenty years; then his son Jonathan, twenty-eight years; and then
Jonathan, Jr., about sixty yours; and nest Lawrence and Aés son Jona-
