That the taste for slender figures was not contined to England will be |
shown by the following quotation from Dunbar’s Phistle and Rose. |
When the belles of Scotland grouped together are described he tells |

} us that

« Tbeir middles were as small as wands.” |

A great number of ancient writings descriptive of female beauty go |

clearly to prove that both slenderness and length of waist were held in |

| the highest esteem and considered indispensable elements of elegance, i

as Chaucer’s day, about 13.40. Tic, in describing the carpenter’s wife, |

speaks of her as a handsonic, well-made young femulc, and informs us |

immediately afterwards that she was

| “Long as a maste, and upright as a bolt.”

the thirteenth century, the talents of the ingenious were directed to the

fourteenth centuries. Tle says. —

| of a beautiful form, and, generally speaking, its length was currently regu-
lated by a just idea of elegance, and especially in the thirteenth century.

| In the fourteenth the women seem to have contracted a yitiated taste,

| and not being content with their form as God hath made it, introduced |
