CHAPTER V
Rusn SEATING

Rush seating, employing either genuine rush or substitutes, may
be done to good advantage and with excellent results in manual
training shops. No equipment is needed to maintain such work.
The addition af a woven seat to a chair or stool constructed in the
shops will necessarily employ a new, interesting medium in con-
junction with woodwork; and materially increase the pupils’ knowl-
edge of materials and possible combinations. And, as with caning,
the resultant interest in the work at hand more than justifies its
introduction in manual trainig shops. Ruslr seating employs a very
simple weave. Different materials empleyed in weaving naturally
require different degrees of skill, and the difficulries encountered
are those resulting from handling materiz!s and not because of the
complexity of the weave.’ One may very readily undertake the
tushing of ordinary seat frames after a study of printed directions
and tilustrations. I+ should ke understood at the outser that, in
discussing rush seating, materials other than genuine rush are in-
cluded in the term.

Historical.—IJn the British Musewn in London is a seat of
curious shape of Egyptian manufacture, which, it is estimated, was
made previous to 4000 B.C. A small amount of rush sull clings to
the seat frame. he relative date of the construction and weaving
of the chair seat would indicate that rush seating is by no means a
modern art, altho at present rush is extensively emploved in fur-
niture,

The use of rush in England dates no earlier than 1720. Several
types of chairs were made there between that date and 1870. In
France rush was used extensively in the seating of furniture of
Normandy and Brittany about 1750. Flanders produced rush
