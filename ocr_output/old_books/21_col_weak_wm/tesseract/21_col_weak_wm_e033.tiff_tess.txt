| elaborately-ornamented waistbelts in general use, and by their aITUnge-

ment it will be scen that they were so worn as to show the waist off to

lower portion of the figure closely, barely affording scope for the movement |
of the legs in walking. How often these arrangements of dress have |

band being fastened in front just under the bust. Their feet were
meased in sandals, the rudiment of the present Eastern slipper, which
they resembled also in their embroidery and design. Their persons and
apparel, in conformity with Oriental taste in all ages, werc profusely
decked with ornaments, ‘jewels of silver and jewels of gold” with
precious gems of extraordinary size, of which imitations, hardly dis-
