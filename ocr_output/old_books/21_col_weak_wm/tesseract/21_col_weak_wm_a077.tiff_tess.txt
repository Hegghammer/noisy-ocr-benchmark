T will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and relate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
1796 alter ruling over Armenia fhity-cight years.

He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his dominions, and
erew to be so mighty in battle that the neighbouring nations called his
country Aramia and the people were called Aramians, such names as
Anmnenia or Armenians being no doubt later corruptions.

The first victory of Aram was over Neuchar king of Media, whom he
took prisoner and put to death, and made a large part of the country of the
defeated prinee tributary to his own. “The second victory of Aram was over
Barsham king of Babylon, whom also he took prisoney and put to death.

to us, there seems to be grounds for supposing that the © Aramieans”
designated by foreign writers as ‘a people of Semitic race language and
religion, coming trom Northern Arabia and settling in the region between
the western boundaries of Babylonia and the highlands of Western Asia”
were no other than the [fai who under their King Aram had spread their
conquests and their kingdom into Mesopotamia and even to the shores of
the Mediterranean.

Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when he includes
Northern Mesopotamia, together with the mountainous country of Ararat,
under the name of Armenia, and in writing of the Armenian boats that
brought merchandise to Babylon, he remarks that they were constructed in
Armenia, @2 the farts above .1ssyria,
