Added to these importaat factors of racial charactenstics, tnfluences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in ‘Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this super-eadded evil, is, the
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, greater marauders and
depredators than the Purks, the regular occupation of whose lives comprises
murder and robbery, and who have through weary centuries unremittingly
quartered themselves upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits of their labour and toil. Indeed as the Hamidich cavalry which
was established expressly for the [Tomidian massacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized murder, can now find for those habits in
which they were encouraved and trained to indulge by the Hamtdian
régune.

Under all such conditions no hope of better days can be forthcoming,
no prospect of better times seems possible, Or that unhappy portion of the
Armenian race whom jorce of circumstances keeps on the soil of the
fatherland.

‘Phe appoiatment of Christian governors over the provinces in
habited by them micht ameliorate some of the evils, or the other alternative,
of allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespective of creed or
nationality, would furnish some means of selfdefence against the raids
and barbarities of the oppressors; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christian peasant subject to Turkish role, and living in the midst
of his enesies, must remain one long strugele and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Notthe most fertile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the most assiduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincis, can bring to the
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
happiness, and security of life and property, which the law of all civilized
countries wuarantees to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil.
