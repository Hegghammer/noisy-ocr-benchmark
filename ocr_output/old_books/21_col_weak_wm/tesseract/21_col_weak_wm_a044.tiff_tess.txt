THE ARMENIAN MASSACKES AND THE
ARMENIAN DPIEOPLE.
During a period extending over thirty years the civilized world has
heard of ‘Vurkish Massacres of Armenians. Massacres of a nature so
{ferocious and diabolical, so bidcous and revolting, that no pen could adequate-
| ly describe their horrors
{ Writing in 1896, Mr. James Bryce, in his supplementary chapter to the
qth edition of his book “Transcaucasia and Ararat” makes the following
grave comment :-~

“Twenty years isa short space in the life of a nation, But these
twenty years have been filled with sufferings for the Armenian Christians
ercater than their ancestors had to endure during the erght centurtes that
have passed since the first Turkish Conquest of Armenia. They have been
years of misery, slaughter, martyrdom, agony, despair.”

And the years that have followed from 1896 to t999 have had the

of the most forlorn, but the country has not been wiped off the map. It still
occupies the veovraphical place it has held sinee history has been written,
The land of the Muphrates and ‘Tieris, that Araxes valley, where, as simple
and primitive Armenians will to this day assert in unshaken belte!, God made
man in }s own imave, and the country reund the base of Ararat, where the
ecnerations of men once more began to people the earth.

Once the land of Ararat was an independent kingdom until the tide of
victory rolled over it and conquered its independence. Uemmed round by
three Great Empires, Russian, Turkish and Persian, the unfortunate geo-
eraphical position of the country became the cause of its people's ruin,

Tt is of bitter taterest to Armenians to know that Ararat is the point
where the three Enipires, Russian,.Turkish and Persian, meet, whilst the
