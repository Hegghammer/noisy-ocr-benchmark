That caning has not been undertaken to any appreciable extent :
in school shops ts due to the fact thar instructors are unfamiliar
with the weaving processes, Caning is net diffceule.. It, in common —
with many other lines of activity, is best learned thru observation. -
However. it may be undertaken by the average person after careful
study af printed directions and illustrations. Tf the worker will
closely observe his own work as it progresses, and follows instruc-—
tions carefully, be should have no unusital difficulty in caning an
area very acceptably in the initial artempr. Particular attention
should be paid to directions which tell of errors to avoid. Errors
creep in, in a very unobtrusive manner at times, and the amateur
will find them hard to detect.

Cane.—Cane is the nanie applied to a great number of plants
which possess long, slender, reedjike stems. “Che name should apply
only to a class of palms called rattans. These plants are found
thruout the Indian Archipelage, China, India, Ceylen, and the
Malay Peninsula. They grow in dense, dark forests and form a
matted undergrowth which makes passage diffcult ar impossible.
These pales are trailing in tendency, vet frequently grow to tree
height. They then fali over and He on the ground. ‘The stem ts
covered with beautiful green foliage, grows tu a length of 100 to
300 ft, and rarely exceeds 1 in. in diameter. ‘Uhe stems are cut
into lengths of 10 to 20 ft. for export. The outer bark is stripped d
into widths varying from 1/16 to 3/16 in. “These strips are put
into hanks ef 1,000 lineal feer each. The cane is then ready for
the cane weaver. A hank of cane custs from 60 cents to $1. The
width of the cane and its quality determines the price per hank.
