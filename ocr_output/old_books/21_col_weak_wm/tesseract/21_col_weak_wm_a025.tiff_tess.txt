VPurther in answer to Ahmed Riza Bey’s account of the Armenian
“orctendus patriotards "tn connection with the Ottoman Bank ; | cannot do
better than quote from Mr. Bryce’s version of the story, and the massacre
that followed: ‘In the following June serious trouble arose at Van, where
some sort ot insurrection is said to have been planned, though in the discre-
pancy of the accounts itis hard to arrive at the truth. Masses of turds
came down threatening to massacre the Christians, and a conilict tn which
many innocent persons perished, was with dithceulty brought to an end by
the intervention of the British Consul. A hittle later the Armenian revolu-
tionary party, emboldened by the rising in Crete, where the Christians, being:
well armed and outnumberine the Muslims, held their ground successfully,
issucd appeals to the [Embassies and to the Turkish Government to introduce
reforms, threatening cisturhanecs if the policy of repression and massacre
was persisted in. These threats were repeated in August, and ultimately,
on August 26, a bandof about twenty Armenians, belonging the revolutionary
party, made a sudden attack on the Imperial Ottoman Bank in Constan-
tinopie, declaring they were prepared to hold it and blow it up should the
Sultan refuse their demand. “Uhey captured the building hy a coup ee main,

fal \rmenian population, The onslaught began in various parts of the city so
socn after the attack on the Bank that it had obviously been prearranyed,
and the precaution had heen taken to employ the Turkish ruthans in different
quarters from those in which they dwelt; so that they might less easily be
recoonised. Carts had moreover been prepared ta which to carry olf the
dead. For two days an indiscriminate slaughter went on, in which not only
Armenian merchants and traders of the cultivated class, not only the indus-
trious and peaceable Armenians of the humbler class, clerks, domestic ser-
vants, porters employed on the quays and in the warehouses, but also women
and children were butchered in the streets and hunted down all through the
suburbs. On the afternoon of the 27th the British Charge d'Atfaires (whose
action throughout won general approval) told the Sultan he would land
British sailors, and the Ambassadors telegraphed to the Sultan. “Then the
general massacre was stopped, though sporadic slaughter went on round the
city during the next few days. The Ambassadors, who did not hesitate
to declare that the massacre had been organised by the Government,
estimated the number of killed at from 6500 to 7000; the ofneial report
