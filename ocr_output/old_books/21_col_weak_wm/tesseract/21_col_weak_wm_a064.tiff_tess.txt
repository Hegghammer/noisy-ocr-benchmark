Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
‘Turkish rule? To this question, we must answer an emphatic No!

‘The causes that must operate against any change are many and deep-
seated, Inthe first place it cannot be expected that a few Turks of liberal
ideas (or it may be French polished) at Constantinople, are going to change
the thonght and character of the nation. The characteristics of a people
change very slowly, if they ever chanve at all, and the predominant national
traits of the many-bloeded modern Vurk have been shown to the world to
be, cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a fierce sensuality ; and what ts
more than all, and which has to be remembered most, is, that they are a
people accustomed to the unbridled cratitteation of their worst passious.

Vhe cthnographic traits of the Turkman which history bears out, are
widness and fierceness, and it would not be incerreet to argue that with the
instincts of hits primitive ancestors have been assimilated the many cross
currents that run in his veins, inte all of which lias heen infused the
doctrines of the religion of the sword, a reheion which Cocs not make for
the peace or well beiny of mankind; a relizion, also, which assigning one of
the two sexes to the degraded position of being created solely tor the cross
pleasure of the other, docs net make tor the exaltation of mankind.

To quote again the eminent authority previously referred to: ' No
Mahominedan race or dynasty has cver shown itsely able to vovern weil
even subjects of its own religion, while to extend equal rights to subjects of
a diferent erced is forbidden by the very law of its being.”

Not the Jewish conceit proclaiminy itself God's elect and chosen, and
originating the name “heathen which it scorned, Not the Christian conceit
emanating from the Jewish source, and laying the flattering unction to its
soul of superiority over the ‘heathen ' ofits own time. Not the unbending
caste exchisivencss of the Brahman acress whose path even the shadow of
ihe despised Sudra falling would be deemed defilement. Not any of these,
can equal the intolerant religions pride of the Mahommedan, or reach the
pinnacle of religious selfsufticiency on which he has seated himselt, “Vo be
a Mahommedan, is enough— Cela szfjit,

‘To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans, and
intimate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahommedan is above all things a Mahommedan. His
region is the paramount question in his life, and remains its predominating
feature above everything clse. “This should not be surprising, since to the
‘faithful’? Paradise is securcd, and all crimes and transeressions against
‘unbelievers’ absolved.
