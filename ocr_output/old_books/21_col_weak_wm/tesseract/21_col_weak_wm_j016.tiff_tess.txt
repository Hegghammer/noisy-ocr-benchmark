second peg. This operatian is repeated until all holes have been
utihzed on the two parallel rails, except those on the corners,
Thruout the seven operations it is necessary that the cane be ke
from twisting by drawing the remaining part of the strand th
thumb and forefinger.
Step 2. The second step is identical with the first, with the dif-
ference that the other two parallel rails are used, and that the
canes run over the first set of parallel
—— canes. If the first strand of cane ha

the second step.
Step 3. Vhis step is a repetition of the first two. The canes 6
this series run aver the first and second series and parallel with tho
first. As each strand is used up bind the end by pulling it undes
a cane, crossing from one hole to another underneath the frame
and cutting off about 44 in. from the cane, Fig. 5 shows how thir
binding is done. The louse end at the starting point is tied in thi
way, and all subsequent ones should be tied as ther come, thu
avoiding interference by many pegs, and insuring neat binding.
Step g. The actual weaving begins with this step. Tt may b
done entirely by hand, without resort to the needle, but it is slow 4
work, The needle should be used. Start at a hole next to a corner
on cither rail that has been used but once, working from caned side
toward the open frame. Gu ever and under the strands necessary
to form the weave, turning the needle from side to side in order to Ff
catch the canes behind the point. When across thread the needle
with the strand and pull thru, being careful to aveid a owist. Pull :
the end down thru the hole, pairing the canes. Pull the cane up i
thru the next hole; then start the needle from the apposite side of
the frame and repeat the first operation, thus pairing another set {
of canes, Continue until all canes are patred and all holes used. ;
