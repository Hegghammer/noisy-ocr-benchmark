PART OL
THE ARMIENIAN MASSACRISS AND VHIE
TREATY OF BERLIN.

Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Turope at the fimous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the stll more famous ‘Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel tn history.

In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the prond array of representatives of the powertul Governments of [curope,
but in the toterests of Humanity there shonld be attached to that painung
the wordiny of Article 61 of the Treaty of Beriin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).

Tre was a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of “the
terrible stronghold of Kars,” universally admitted to be one of the vreatest
aud most difficult military exploits ever achieved, and the crowning success
of the Russian arms in Astatic Purkey, should have been accemphshed by
an Armenian General; that although Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest, and Armenian soldiers foucht, conqnered and
died, yet by these suecesses not only was no amcHoration attained of the
hard fate of their unhappy nation under Turkish rife, but that fate, hard
before, was made a bundredfold and even a thousandfold harder.
