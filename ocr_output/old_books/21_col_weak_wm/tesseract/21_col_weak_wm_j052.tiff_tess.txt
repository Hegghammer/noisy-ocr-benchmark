used over a block of soft wood. “Uhis may be done at frequent
intervals or when several strands have been woven over each rail.

Uniform tension on the strand is desirable and this should be cight.
As the work progresses the interior between the upper and lower
rows of strands is stuffed, “Uhis is done with the same materia! as
that used in the weaving. The butt ends of rush are used to stuff
the seat of rush; raffia is used to stuff a raffia seat; craft paper to
stuff a ber seat; and soon. ‘The packing should be done tn a thoro
manner, for it builds up the scat and prevents its breaking down at
the inner edges of the rails, and sagging with continued use. A
shyhtly curved hardwood stick about 12 in. long may be used to
advantage to do this work. Fig. 41 shows a sketch of such a stick.
