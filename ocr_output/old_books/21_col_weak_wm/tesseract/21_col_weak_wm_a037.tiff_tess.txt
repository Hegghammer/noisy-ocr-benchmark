No one doubts that a great forward movement ts reaching its culminat-
ine point in the destiny of Asia. The West has learne its allot religion (the
moral and guiding principle of mankind) from the East, and now the Mast
would fain learn the law of restraint and the law of treedom (the protecting
principles of mankind) from the West. Inspired by this feeling the Hberal
Turks decidedly mean weli, and they are animated with a sincere desire to
ensure peace and security of life and property for the heteroveneous peoples
under the ‘Turkish sway, bue they themselves have had to contend and still
have to conten? with a fanatical populace.

‘Yo the Mahommedan world at large the Caliph of Islam is the envoy of
God, the sacredness of whose person must be inviolate. Abdul Hamid, the
astute politician, knew that the security of his sovercignty depended on his
Caliphal rights, and his main policy during the lone period of his cxecrable
reign had been directed towards preserving and asserting the same; thus
we can sec how his dethronement, which the liberal Turks would cladly have
accomplished simultaneously with the inauzuration of the Constitution, had
to be deferred to a later period, and how tt was necessary for the She k ul

ofa hostile religion, with no power or force behind them which makes for
protection. Who Coes not know that the creat numerical preponderance of
Hinduism keeps tne balance of power in India, and restrains bloody religious
hostilities; and when we review the whole religious histery of Christian
Europe, and that terribly long roll of crimes committed in the name of lim
whe expounded [ls religion with the parable of the Good Samaritan, and
the precept of loving one’s neighbour as one’s self, we cannot feel surprise at
the fanatical outbursts of the followers of Mahommed, the founder of a
religion whose dectrines certainly fall short of the humane principles

finculcated by the Founder of Christianity, If authentic historical facts prove

to us that horrible and atrocious crueltics have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other relivionists, but on fellow Christians of different
denominations, how then can we expect better things from the Turk unless
some power or force restrain him ?

Christianity has now partly emancipated herself from the terocities
which darkened and poured the red stream of bleod on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at larce, religion is sull the powder magazine
which a spark can tenite.
