The reader will see ata glance the plan of this book. We com-
meee with the Christian name, ‘Vhen folluws the parentage, genea-
lowical data, &c., and then the Christian names of the children and
order of births. fn many of the early families the exact order of
births cannot be ascertained ; but it has been approximated as nearly
as possible. “Vhe lineage is given in conneciion with the firs: member
of the family, Vhe Roman numerals indicate the order of births.
The sons and daughters of the oid Purtian, Darnahas, constiture the
second generation, buf they are spoken by way of eminence as Joseph
L., Hannah L, We. ‘Vhe book contains much repetition, but none
too much to make it plain and casy tu soidy.

This little book contains the chronicles of only about one-half of
the Horton families louked ap. ‘Vhose whose genealouical data are
given only in a@ small parr, and those whose correct Jineage has not
been satisfactorily ascertained, are not inclided in this book.
