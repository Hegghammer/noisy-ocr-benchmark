two, the wall of iron that rises between them is the position of woman. The
Armenian has accepted whole-heartedly the position in which woman has
been placed by the Great Founder of his faith, For seventeen hundred
years unremittingly since Christianity was revived in Armema by Gregory
the Muminator, the Christian law with regard to the position of woman has
moulded the thought of the nation, it has left its impress on the nation, and
it is this vitaland essential difference between the law of Mahomined and the
law of Christ that like a two-cdeed sword has cleaved apart Christian
Armenian from Moslem Turk and Persian.

If “Fast is Fast, and West is West” it ts on account of the soctal plane
on which woman stands, a social plane that is never so degraded in any
corner of Asia, as it is in the countries where the law of Mahommed governs.

‘Parks and other antagonistic races ; they are without any military force or

That Europe should aid their endeavours, er that Turkey should make them
a free gift of autonomy, are both of them absolutely out of the question.

‘Yo hold to our own nationality and to be subject—Subject to Russia,
subject to Turkey, subject to Versia—\What shall it profit us? \What will

beautiful, intelligent women, when neither chance nor opportunity can enable
our finest and best to reach the hivher rungs of the world’s ladder, and
when as a subject people we must ever remain hewers of wood and drawers
of water, even our Aivasowskis and our Melikofis have been lnown to the
world as Russians, notas Armenians. Have we a chance of bursting the
tetters? Have we strength to break the chains? Can we reach the goal
toward which, bleeding and torn, we have been striving, and sull are striving?
Yhese are questions which we must ask ourselves ; looking them soberly in
the face.

But this is bot enough: if we must persist in holding to our our national-
ity, we must look into ourselves, we must search out and probe our national
failings anc our national weaknesses, and find outin what essential character-
isties we are wanting as a nation, and so build up national character. Let
us weich ourselves in the balance, and supply what in us is found wanting.

fu the period of less than a decade a Great Power has risen in the
Orient. ‘The people of a small island empire with an empty Treasury have
beaten successfully and disastrously a colossal empire of whom the Powers
of Europe had stood in awe, and against whom not one had ventured single-
handed to engage.
