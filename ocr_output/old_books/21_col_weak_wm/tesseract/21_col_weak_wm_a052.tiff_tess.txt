THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND CIVILIZED
EURO,
“Hear then ye Senates ! hear this truth sublime,
Vhey who allow Oppression share the crime.”

“A voice was heard in Ramah, Jamentation, and bitter weeping ; Rahel
weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because
they were not.”

In the twentieth century of the christian cra, in the age of trumpeted
progress, of boastcd and vaunted civilization, there is a Ramah of countries,
a desolated Ramah, blackened and calcined with the fires of oppression, and
over her desolated wastes there flows, tlows, continually flows, ever re-
plenished and ever renewed, that red stream which crieth up from the earth
to God: and out of this modern Ramah, a votee is heard of lamentation and
hitter weeping, it riseth up in its boundless anguish to reach the heavens, it
crieth out and will not he stopped, for itis the voice of the Rahel of nations
weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are not.

Who that has read the history of the Crusades has not turned with
sickening disenst from the chapters wherein history has recorded the savage
barbarities and fearful excesses of those christian warriors, who went to
Palestine ostensibly fired with the enthusiasm ofa holy cause, but in reality
only to glut in slaughter and gratify brutal passions. lurope has, however,
designated her past as the “dark ages” into which she has thrust back, the
ferocions outbursts of religion, the merciless persecutions of the church, the
savage sweep of the barbarians of the north, and the unbridled tyrannies ot
despoue pawer, from all which she loudly boasts to have emancipated herself,
and like the evolution according to the Darwinian theory of the anthro-
pomorphal apc, to have progressed into the state of civilization. But
beginning from the last quarter of the nineteenth and on into the first decade
of the twentieth century, the horrors of the darkest ages in human history
have Jain at her doors, and towards these horrors Murope has kept up the
role of an extenuatingly disclaiming, a mildly rebuking sweetly frowning,
snulincly denouncing, Disapprover.

Half a million Armenians annihilated by organized massacres of the
most ferocious and hideous natures, and perhaps a corresponding number
