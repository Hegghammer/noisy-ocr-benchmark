THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE. 45
Fairies, and attendant ladies are described. OF two of the latter it
is said—
| “Their kirtles were of rede cendel,* {
J laced smalle, jollyf, and well}
| There might none gayer go.’’
| In the French version of the same poem it ts, we read, more fully ‘
| expressed, Tt says, “They were richly habited and very tightly laced.” |
The Lady Trianore is thus described :-—
“ The lady was in a purple pall, i
With pertil] bodye and middle small”? |
Wharton quotes from an ancient poen, which he believes to date as
far back as 1200, in which a lover, speaking of the object of hus
admiration, thus throws down the gauntlet of challenge, and exclaims-—
« Middle her she hath mensk small.”
The word meusk or main being used instead of very or much. Some
diflerences of opinion have existed among writers as to the origin of the
word corset. Some are of opinion that the French words corps, the
| body, and serrer (to tightly inclose or incase), led to the adoption of
| the term. Madame La Sante gives it as her opinion, however, that it is
| more probably a corruption of the single word corps, which was formerly
| written cers, and may be taken as a diminutive form of it. Another |
view of the matter has been that the name of a rich material called
corse, Which was at one time extensively used in the manufacture of
corsets, nay have been thus corrupted. This is scarcely prebable, as
| the word corset was im use at too early a period to admit of that origin,
| Perhaps as carly an instance of the use of the term corset as any in
| existence may be found as a portion of an entry in the household register
| of Eleanor, Countess of Leicester, which bears the date May 24, 1265 :—-
| * A rich description of silk.
