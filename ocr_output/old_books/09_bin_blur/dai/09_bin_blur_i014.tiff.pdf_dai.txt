THE ZONE
Avert Thy gaze, O God, close tight Thine eyes!
Glance down no longer on the oceat, foam,
Lest Thou behold such horrory av can turn
Men's burning hearts to ser, and chill their souh
Keep Thing heart warm, and full of chanty
That Thon mayst yet be able to forgive,
And pity feel for those who know not when
To pause in deeds of rithlen ummer
Restrain Thy wrath, and keep Thine hand in
check.
Sinite net, not hercely thrat without the pair
Thu who can dare to strea
With fellow creatures, infocent of wron;
Forget the studied purpose to destry,
The launching of the missile through the deep,
The shattered ball, the crushed and bleeding forms,
The soothing with of merchar, women, met
