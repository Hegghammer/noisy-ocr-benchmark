Van, and the lwest estimate counted the murdered dead at 100,00)). Gila Istone made the
last great speech of his heroic life. England attempted some kind of protest. But rather
than join the Liberal demand for action, I. ad Rosebery left his party for private leisure, and
Russia, France, and Germany combined to secure immunity for the great assassin." It
was the lowest point of Earope's shame,
Blow followed bow, Hardly had the remnant of the Armenian people escaped from
massacre when their Church fell under the bratal domination of Russia. Pichive ordained its
destruction, and Golitzin was sent to Tiflis as governor-general to carry it out Church
property to the value of £5,000,000 was seized by violence, the Katholikos resolutely refusing
to give up the keys of the safe where the title dels were kept (Jan, 1905).
For two years
the Russian officials played with the revenues, retaining eighty per cent. for their own
advantage. But in the dean time assassination had vid the earth of Plehve, and the over-
whehaing defeats of Russia in Manchuria were attribated to the Armenian curse, Grudgingly
the Chuch property was restored, in niter chaos, and for the moment it is Russia's policy to
favor the Armenians as a balance against the Georgians, whom the St. Petersburg government
is now determined to
destroy
Such was the past upon which the worn old man, stretched on his monastic bed, looked
back that winter's morning. Singleness of aim has its reward in spiritaal pence, but of the
fature he was not hopeful.He no longer even e intemplated an aut tomon, Armenia, either
on Turkish territory or on Russian. On the Russian side of the frontier the Armenian
villages were too scattered, too much interspersed with Goorgians and Tartars, to allow
of autonomy. On the Turkish side, he thought, massacre and exile had now left too few of
the race t - forta any kind of community, Indeed, for the last twelve years the Armenian
villagers have been crawling over the foot of Aracat by thousands a year to escape the Kurds,
and every morning they come and stand in fresh groups of pink and blue rags outside the
monastery door where the hend of their Church and race lies dying. They stand there in
mute appeal, as 1 saw them, possessing nothing in the world but the variegated tatters
that cover them, and their faith in their Katholikes. Showly they are drafted away into
Tiflis, Baku, or their Caucasian vihages, but nowhere nre they welcomed.
Some of the bishops and monks, who form a counell and their chief, still look for
Europe's interference, and trust that the solema pledges taken by England and other Powers
at Berlin may be fulfilled. The Bishop of Erivan, for instance, still labors for the appoint-
ment of a Christian governor over the district marked by the ill-omened names of Van, Bitlis,
and Enzerðum. I also found that even among the Georgians there was a large party willing
to concede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian villages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Cancasus wins federal
autonomy. Bat the majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and indastries. One cannot yet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolationary parties of The Bell" and "The Flag." Of these,
the Social Democratic Bell " follows the usual impracticable and pedantic creed of St. Marx.
The Flag," or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a great
assembly held in Erivan last August (1906) they adopted a programme of land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected lavmen. If the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.
Whatever may be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion, Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
