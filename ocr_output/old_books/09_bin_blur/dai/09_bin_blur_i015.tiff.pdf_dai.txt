Remember that they know not what they do
Who stake in deadly fear and chastly hate.
Remember that we chow, and at vore time,
Each one exacts its human penalty
Remember that man'soumice or and man's mind
Are agents of Thy purpose and Thy plan,
What work within a deadlier reven
Than any shraj nel shot or sahre threat.
Remember that now wenerations comme
Upon whom fall the burden and the cure.
The anguish of cld hatredy and post wrongy.
The crushing debt, the strate and deya...
Restrain, O God, the sweep of the vast hate.
Recall the nationa to their sense chanc
To those in blinking war, to uvat
Reveal anen the mouse of the Christ
