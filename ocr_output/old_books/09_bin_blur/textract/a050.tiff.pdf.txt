two, the wall of iron that rises between them is the position of woman. The
Armenian has accepted whole-heartedly the position in which woman has
been placed by the Great Founder of his faith. For seventeen hundred
years unremittingly since Christianity was revived in Armenia by Gregory
the
Illuminator, the Christian law with regard to the position of woman has
moulded the thought of the nation, it has left its impress on the nation, and
it is this vital and essential difference between the law: of Mahommed and the
law of Christ that like a sword has cleaved apart Christian
Armenian from Moslem Turk and l'ersian.
Il East is East, and West is West' it is on account of the social plane
on which woman stands, a social planc that is never so degraded in any
corner of Asia, as it is in the countries where the law of Mahommed governs.
The Armenians in Asiatic Turkey are scattered and dispersed among
Tarks and other antagonistic races : they are without any military force or
organization to wrest autonomy from the military and governing power.
That Europe should aid their endeavours, or that Turkey should make them
a free gift of autonomiy, are both of them absolutely out of the question.

To hold to our own nationality and to be subject-Subject to Rossia,
subject to Turkey, subject to hat shall it profit us? What will
it profit What doth it profit us? Our strong, clever, energetic mea,
our
beautiful, intelligent women, when neither chance nor opportunity can enable
our tinest and best to reach the higher rungs of the workd's ladder, and
when as a subject people we must ever rematti hewers of wood and drawers
of
water, even our Aivasowskis and our Melikoffs have been !nown to the
worki as Russians, not as Armenians. Have "IC a chance of bursting the
fetters Have me strength to break the chains? Can II'C reach the goal
toward which, bleeding and torn, II'C have been striving, and still are striving?
These are questions which we must ask ourselves ; looking them sobarly in
the face.
But this is not enough if we must persist in holding to our our national-
ity, me must look into ourselves, II'C must scarch out and probe our national
failings and our national weaknesses, and find out in what essential character-
istics we are wanting as a nation, and SO build up national character. Let
US weigh ourselves in the balance, and supply what in us is found wanting.
In the period of less than a decade a Great Power has risen in the

beaten successtully and disastrously a colossal empire of whom the Powers
of Europe had stood in awe, and against whom not one had ventured single-
