victims in thy Yildiz Kiosk, found its way to thy treacherous heart. No
poisoned cup of coftee like the countless cups brewed in thy palaces trickled
down thy throat to end thy vampire existence.
Thou hast lived ! Protected from the Nemesis of thy crimes by the
jealousies and rivalries of great powers which thou artfully played oneagainst
another : by the combined forces of religion and plunder which thou cuaningly
wielded into one. Even so thou livest! Poerless living example in the
civilized mentifin century of the Triumph of Crime.
L'AVENIR.
In the joregoing pages ] have directed my humble efforts to sketch out
what the Powers of Europe have done in the past, and how their actions
have reflected on my unfortunate race.
It is considered good policy now by n certain class of European writers
to ascribe all the horrors of the Armenian Massacres to I Hamid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as unassailable and inconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as a sort of superhuman being who swept everything
before him to the consummation of his oun despotic will. The reason for
this is not difficult to perceive. They would fain disavow the part Europe
has played in the tragedy, and to do this successfully it becomes
necessary
also to present Turkey to the workd now as a paradise (from whence the
tyrant once removedi) peopled only by saints and angels SO we have
also
many roscate colored word pictures of Constitutional Turkey.
The marders. deportations and imprisonments of the Turkish revolu-
tionaries, or more correctly retormers, were undoubtediy the sole work of
Abdui Hamid and bis palace clique, but Abdul and his minions couid
not
have
carried out that hellish work of wholesale extermination of the
Armenians without the perperration and participation of the Turkish
people. It is true the massacres were originated and organized in the
Palace, the Palace dique stirred up religious fanaticism and race hatred.
but
the co-operation of the people was necessary and the people co-operated
in order to plunder and enrich thenselves with the woridly goods that the
Armenians always knew how to acquire by the ir own industry and toil ; the
appeal to their marauding and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover casy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about tento one and who were practically unarmed.
