PART I.
THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TRENTY (>) BERLIN.
Since the gathering of the Pleni: otentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1S-S, and the signing of the still more tamous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll OI the unfortunate Armenian nation stands withe ut
its parallel in history.
In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a Dicture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of Europe,
but in the interests of Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of Bertin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).
I: was a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of "the
terrible stronghold of Kars, universally admitted to be one of the greatest
andi most difficult military exploits ever achieved, and the crowning sticcess
of the Russian arms in Asiatic Turkey, shouid have been accomplished by
an Armenian General : that aithough Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest, and Armenian soldiers fought, conquered and
died, yet is these successes not only was no amelioration attained of the
hard tate of their unbappy nation under Turkish rule, Lut that fate, hard
before, was made a hundrediold and even a thoasandfold harder.
