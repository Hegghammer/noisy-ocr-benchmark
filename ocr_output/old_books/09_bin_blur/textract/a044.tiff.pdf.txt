THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
ARMENIAN PEOPLE
During a period extending over thirty years the civilized world has
heard of Turkish Massacres of Armenians. Massacres ut a nature SO
ferocious and diabolicai. so bidcous and revolting. that no pen could adequate
ly describe their horrors
Writing in Mr. James Bryce, in his supplementary chapter to the
1th edition of his book Transcaucasia and Ararat" makes the following
grave comment :-
Twenty years is a short space in the life of a nation. But these

three Great Empires, Russian, Turkish and Persian, the unfortunate
