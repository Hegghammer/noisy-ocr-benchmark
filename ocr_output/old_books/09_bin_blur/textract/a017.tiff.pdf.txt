As these sheets are going through the press there comes news of famine
at Zeitoion. The Rev. F. II: Macullum, American Missionary at Marash,
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet, American Missionary at Constantinople, that
1 2,000 souls in and around %.cimon are dying of hunger they are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran and water, and cooking and eating it, ií they can
get even that. Rev. Macullum adds, The same story comes to us from all
sides. is we foresaix all along, from 11 now on the distress will be greatest.
If 50,000 were massacred, the list of those who have died and are dying
of homelessness and starvation will exreed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerated. Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.
The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered in a night attack
by armed Kurds, and the villagers are now reduced to extreme distress. Before
the outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeatedly appealed
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec-
tion tor the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It is
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
