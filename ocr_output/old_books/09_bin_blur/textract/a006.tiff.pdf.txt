When this book was written, the writer was
under the supposition then generally current that
the Armenian Massacres of April, 1909. in Cilicia
were instigated by Abd ul lamid and his Yildiz
Cique. Babikian Effendi, the Armenian deputy
who went to Adana from Constantinople to in-
restigate into the massacres, plaily reported that
all investigations had failed to trace them to Abd ul
Hamid and his Yildiz Clique. Babikian Effendi,
as was to be expected, died sud-lenly on his return
to Constantinople, but later on it became known
th it themassacreso April, 1909. hadbeen planned,
prepared, organized and carried into execution by
the Constitutional Government of what has been
called Liberal Turks" or Young Turks."
