Since the ime of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have cluug to their christian faith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure.

The cathedral of etchmitatzin built by Gregory sll stands to-day ; it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, until perhaps
little of the original building may be left, but ic still claims to be the church
built by the patron saint of Armenia. [shall here quote a passage from
‘Historical Sketch of the Armenian Church,” written by an Armenian
priest :

“Owing to political circumstances the Armenian Patnarchate had at
umes to be transferred to metropolises and to other principal towns of
Armenia. In the year AD. p52 it was removed to Dwin, in 993 to Ani,
in rieg to Romblah, and in 129.4 to Sis. The Kingdom of Cilicia becoming
extinct, and, we having no more a kingdom and no longer a capital town, it
was natural and proper to re-transfer the See to its own original place, as
the entire nation unanimously desired it, Accordingly, in the vear rg44, it

- was decided by an ecclesiastical meeting that the seat ot the Catholicus should
return to Holy Etchmiatzin, where to this day has been preserved the
proper unbroken succession from our Apostles and trom cur holy lather,
St. Gregory the [luminator.”

I read the other day in cne of the foreign papers published in) Japan,
the following piece of news : .

“Aa Armenian Church pronounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christian era, has been discovered ina fair state of preserva:
tion in the neehbourheod of Basi Aparnal.”

Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light on Armenian history.
