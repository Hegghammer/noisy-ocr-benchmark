THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND CIVILIZED
HURODE.
“Hear then ye Senates ! hear this truth sublime,
They who allow Oppression share the crime.”

“A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping ; Rahel
weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because
they were now”

Tn the twentieth century of the christian era, in the age of trumpeted
progress, of boasted and vaunted civilization, there is a Ramah of countries,
a desolated Ramah, blackened and calcined with the fires of oppression, and
over her desolated wastes there flows, Hows. continually flows, ever re-

to God: and out of this modern Ramah, a voice is heard of lamentation and
bitter weeping, it riseth up in its boundless anguish to reach the heavens, it
crieth out and will not be stopped, for itis the voice of the Rahel of nations
weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are not.

Ah! thou Rahel of nations! to the cry of thy boundless anguish, to thy

savage sweep of the barbarians of the north, and the unbridled tyrannies ot
despotic power, from all which she loudly boasts to have emancipated herself,
and like the evolution according to the Darwinian theory of the anthro-
pomorphal ape, to have prozressed into the state of civilization, But
beginning from the last quarter of the nineteenth and oa into the first decade
of the twentieth century, the horrors of the darkest ages in human history
have lain at her doors, and towards these horrors Europe has kept up the
role of an extenuatingly disclaiming, a mildly rebuking sweetly frowning,
sindingly denouncing, Disapprover.

Half'a millon Armenians annihilated by organized massacres of the
most ferocious and hideous natures, and perhaps a corresponding number
