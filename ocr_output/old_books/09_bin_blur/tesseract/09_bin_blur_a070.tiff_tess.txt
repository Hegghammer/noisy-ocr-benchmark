ISAVEENTR.,

Jn the foregoing paves ] have directed my humble efforts to sketch out
what the Powers of Europe have done in the past, and how their actions
have reflected on my unfortunate race.

It is considered good policy now by a certain class of European writers
to ascribe all the horrors of the Armenian Massacres to Hamid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as unassailable and unconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as a sort of superhuman being who swept everything
before him to the consummation of his own despotic wil. The reason for
this is not difficult to perceive.  “Phey would fain disavow the part Europe
has played in the tragedy, and to do this successfully it becomes necessary
also to present Turkey to the world now as a paradise (from whence the
tyrant once removed) peopled onty by saints and angels: so we have also
many roseate colored word pictures of Consturtonal ‘Turkey.

The murders, deportations and imprisonments of the “Turkish revolu-
tionaries, or more correcdy reformers, were uadoubtediy the sole work ot
Abdui Hamid and bis palace clique, but Abdul and his minions couid not
have carried out that hellish work of wholesale cxtermination of the

Armenians without the perpetration and participation of the ‘Turkish
people. It as true the massacres were originated and organized in’ the
Palace, the Paiace clique stirred up religious fanaticisny and race hatred, but
the co-operation of the people was necessary; and the people co-operated
in order to plunder and enrich themselves with the woridly goods that the
Armenians always knew how to acquire by their owo industry and toil; the
appeal to their marauding and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work fora race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
