No one doubts that a creat forward movement is reaching its culminat-
inv point in the destiny of Asia. “The West has learnt tts a'bot religion (the
moral and guiding principle of inankind) from the East, and now the East
would fain learn the Law of restraint and the law of freedom (the protecting
principles of mankind) from the West — Tnspired by this fecting the liberal
Turks decidedly mean wel, and they are animated with a sincere desire to
ensure peace and security of life and property for the heterogencous peoples
under the Turkish sway, but they themselves have bad to contend and still
have to contend with a fanaucal populace.

To the Mahommedan world at large tae Caliph of Islam is the envoy of
God, the sacredness of whose person must be inviolate. Abdul Hamid, the
astute politicuin, knew that the security of his sovereignty depended on his
Caliphal rights, and his main policy during the long period of his execrable
reign had been directed towards preserving and asserting the same; thus
we can see how his dethronement, which the liberal Turks would cladly have
accomplished simultaneously with the inauguration of the Constitution, had
to be deferred to a later period, and how it was necessary for the She k ul
Islam to pronounce the Caliph a traitor to bis sacred trust, a violator of the
holy law of the Prophet. before Is dethronement could be dared or
accomplished. -

Vhe Christian Armenians in Turkey live in the midst of the followers
ofa hosale religion, with no power or force behind them which makes for
protection. Who Goes not know that the ereat numerical preponderance ot
Hinduism keeps the balance of power in India, and restrains bloody religious
hostulities; and when we review the whole religious history of Christian
Europe, and that terribly long roll of crimes committed in the name of Him
who expounded His religion with the parable of the Good Samaritan, and
the precept of loving one’s neighbour as one’s self, we cannot feel surprise at
the fanatical outbursts of the followers of Mahommed, the founder of a
religion whose doctrines certainly fall sbort of the humane principles

*inculcated by the Founder of Christianity. If autheotic historical facts prove
to us that horrible and atrocious cruelties have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other religionists, bute on fellow Christians of different
denominations, how then can we expect better things from the ‘Turk unless
some power or force restrain him ?

Christianity has now partly emancipated herself from the ferocities
which darkened and poured the red stream of blcod on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at large, religion is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite.
