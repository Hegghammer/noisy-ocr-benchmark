THR ARMENIAN MASSACKES AND THE
ARMIENTAN PIEOPLT:.

During a period extending over thirty years the civilized world has
heard of ‘Turkish Massacres of “Armenians. © Massacres ot a nature so
ferocious and diaLolicai, so hideous and revoluas, that no pen could adequate-
ly describe their horrors

Writing in 1896, Mr. James Bryce, in his supplementary chapter to the
qth edition of his book * Transcaucasia and Ararat’? makes the following
grave comment :—

“Twenty years ts ashort space in the life of a nation. But these
twenty years have been nlled with sufferings for the .\rivenian Christians

The land of the Fuphrates and ‘Vieris, that Araxes vailey, where, as simple
and primitive Armenians will to this day assert in unshaken belief, God made
man in His own image, and the country reund the base of Ararat, where the
generations of men once more began to people the earth.

Once the Jand of Ararat was an independent kingdom until the tide of
victory rolled over itand conquered its independence. Hemmed round by
three Great Empires, Russian, Turkish and Persian, the unfortunate g¢o-

It is of bitter interest to Armenians to know that Ararat is the point
where the three Empires, Russian,. Turkish and Persian, meet, whist the
