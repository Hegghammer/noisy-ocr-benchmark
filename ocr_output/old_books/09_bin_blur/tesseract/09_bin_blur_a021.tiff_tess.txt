earth as other nations? Does Humanity, does Christianity allow that tender
babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and butchered
before the eyes of their mothers, or that the cars of mothers should be rent
with the cries of the dying agony of their murdered children? = Does
Humanity, does Christianity allow that helpless womea should be forcibly
subjected to the most hideous, the most loathsome, the most revolting, and
the most cruel outraves? Does Humanity, does Christianity, allow all this ?

© Christian Goveraments have organized a Hague Conference of Peace
and Civilization, but they nave. closed its doors to the cause ot a bleeding
chrisdan race groanins under the voke of the cruellest: oppressors chat the
world has yet known, Christian men aad women have held up their hands
in horror at the Indian Jugzernauth; but alas! the political wheels ot

extermination, why thea you must dig, and we have to condone your hellish
extermination, for in any case, cach one of us must secure his own political
aad commercial interests in this same Empire of your Oppressors.”
