INTRODUCTION
TO 2sp PREN TENG,

My object in writing this litde book is to Jay the hard case ef my un-
fortunate race before the men and women of the United States: since it ts

the sulphur flames of religious fanaticism burst, the lava floods of race hatred
and Just of plunder, break forth and run in fiery streams; the untortunate
victims are pounced upon, swooped upon, pillaged, plundered, butchered,
slaughtered, subjected to outrages so hideous, cruel, loathsome, and revolt-
ing, that no pen could depict their horrible realities and the details can never
go into print. The human mind is staggered and asks itself the question if
even the imaginations of fends and devils could originate such horrors.
Then this orgy of the bnman fiends is arrested. For the time being the
appetite for blood, lust, and plunder is satistied ; for the ume being, the cye
is content with the scenes of havoc and desolation hing under the sun; the
