of the Porte have been unreasonably forgotten or neglected. “They are fully
as wretched as the Slavs or Cretans have been: and in so far worse off,
that in Europe there exists no large body of tribes making murder and
robbery its reguiar and daily occupation as the Wurds, and latterly the
Circassians also, have done in Armenia. T?fanyone will take the trouble to
read the complaints of oppressions and crucities presented to the Porte by
the Armenian Patriarchate in 1872 (siece reprinted in England) ard some ot
the more recent statements printes by the Armenians in’ Roeland on the
same topic, he wil see that the state of Turkish Asia presents as grave and
pressing a problem as that of Buleartc itsecf"

In the jth edition of the same book. published in 1896, the following
note appears to the passave IT have quoted :

“Shortly after dus was written, the Blue Books presented to Parha-
ment, contaning reports from Briush Consals in) Asiatic Turkey, showed

reform party frst rose in power, and nine months after the inauguration of
the Constitution. [do aot question the goodwill of the reform party, but
the reform party does rot comprise the whole Turkish nation, and until the
Turk learns to beceme liberal, civilized and human, there may be no more
Armenians left, unless some Christtan Power such as the United States
demands ther protection and entorces it. No! my Christian friends, it can
be well for other Christians in the ‘Turkish Empire with their powerful
Governments at their back ; but alas! there is no security for a subject
people alien in race and religion,

The massacres in April last raged from) Adana to Alexandretta, and
according to authenticated reports about fifty thousand men, women and
children were hideously exterminated ; more than this, the last massacres
were especially characterized by the most hideous, the most loathsome, the
most revolting and ferocious cruelties perpetrated on women and children.
Now what other name can we find for the perpetraters of this diabolical
