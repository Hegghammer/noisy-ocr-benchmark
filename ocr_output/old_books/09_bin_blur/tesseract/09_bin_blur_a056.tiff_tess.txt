and maneled shuttle cock of powerful bats.
Much has been written and much has been said by great authorities,
(far more comprehensively an! by pens much more forcible than my humble
© efforts could’ aspire to reach) against the seishness and callousness, the
inhumanity and cynicism of those great powers which have coldly looked on

The name ot Willam Ewart Gladstone ts loved and revered by Armenians
all over the world; but the thunderings of that veteran statesman and the
denouncing protests of those though:ful men whose feelings of revolted
humanity have made themselves heard tn sounding language, have fallen on
stony ground ; they have been like the voices of men crying out in the wilder-
ness. Europe has turned a deat car to the condemnations of justice and
teath, even as she has turned a deat ear to the voice of Rahel weeping for
her slaughtered children.
