Further in answer to Ahmed Riza Bey’s account of the .\rmenian
“prevendus patrioards "in connection with the Ottoman Bank ; Peannot do
better than quote from Mr. Bryce’s version of the story, and the massacre
that followed > “(In the following June serious trouble arose at Van, where
some sort of insurrection is said te have been planned, though in the discre-
pancy of the accoucts itis hard to arrive at the truth. Masses of Kurds
came down threatening to massacre the Christians, and a conthiet tn witch
many innocent persons perished, was with difficulty brought to an end by
the intervention of the British Consul. A hte later the Armenian revolu-
tionary party, emboldened by the rising in Crete, where the Christians, being
well armed and oumumbering the Muslims, held their ground successtully,
issued appeals to the Embassies and to the Turkish Government to introduce
refonns, threatening disturbances if the policy of repression and massacre
was persisted tn. “These threats were repeated in) August, and ultimately,
on Aueust 26, a band of about twenty Armenians, belonging the revolutionary
party, made a sudden attack on the Imperial Ottoman Bank in Constan-
tinople, declaring they were prepared to hold it and blow it up should the
Sultan refuse their demand. “They captured the building by a coup ae urar,
but were persuaded by the Russian dragoman to withdraw upon a proniuse

and the precaution had been taken to employ the Turkish cuttians in different
quarters from those tn which they dwelt: so that they might less easily be
recognised, Carts had moreover been prepared ti which to carry off the
dead. For two days an indiscriminate slaughter went on, tn which not only
Armenian merchants and tracers of the cuattvated class, not onty the indus-
trious and peaceable Armenians of the humbler class, clerks, domestic ser-
vants, porters employed on the quays and in the warehouses, but also women
and children were butchered in the streets and hunted down all through the
suburbs. On the afternoon of the 27th the British Chareeé a’ Affaires (whose
action throughout won general approval) told the Sultan he would land
British sailors, and the Ambassadors telegraphed to the Sultan. Then the
general massacre was stopped, thouch sporadic slaughter went on round the
city during the next few days. The Ambassadors, who did not hesitate
to declare that the massacre had been organised by the Government,
estimated the number of killed at from. 62500 to 7000; the otncial report
