DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE,
Thave thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1999, given by disinterested witnesses.

"Weare having a perteetly hideous time here. “thousands have been mardered — 25,000
in thts province they say; but the number is vralably greater, for every Christian villaze

made peace, the Turks came in the night with bose and kerosene. and set fire te what remained
ofthe \rmeniim quarter, Nestday the French and \rmenian schools were fired. Nearly every:
one in the Armenian school perished, auybody trying ty escape being shot dawn by thesuldiers.”

“Yao Turkish Authorities do nothing except arrest unotheading Armenians, trom whon
by torture they extort the most funciful contests. Even dhe wounded are net sue from
their injustice, Noman was betpyg carried in tone yesterday when he was seized and taken
off to gael TP dare not think what his fate mii be.

“Por fend+ drearnate commend me to tre Turks. Nobody is safe from them. ‘Phey
murder babies in front of their mothers > they haltmurder men, and violate the wives while
the husbands are Iving there dying in paols ef blood.”

“The authorities dit nothing, and the soldiers were worse than the crowd, toa they were
better armed, One house in ear qaarter was barued with 115 people inside. We evimted .
the bodies. ‘The soldiers set the to the door, andoas the windows had ivon bars, nobody
