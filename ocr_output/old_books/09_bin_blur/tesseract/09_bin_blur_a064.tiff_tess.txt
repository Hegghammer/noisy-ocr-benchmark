Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
‘Turkish rule?) To this question, we must answer an emphatic No!

Vhe causes that must operate against any chenge are many and deep-
seated. Ta the first place it cannot be expected that a few Turks of liberal
ideas (or it may be French polished) at Constantinople, are going to chanze
the thought and character of the natin. The characteristics of a people
chanee very slowly, if they ever change at all, and the predominant national
traits of the many -blocded modern Turk have been shown to the world to
be, cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a fierce sensuality ; and what is
more than all, and which has to be remembered most, ts, that they are a
people accustomed to the unbridled gratification of thetr worst passions.

The cthnographic traits of the Turkman which history bears out, are
widness and fierceness, and it would not be incorrect to argue that with the
instincts of hts primitive ancestors have becn assimilated the many cross
currents that run in his) veins, into all of which has been infused the
doctrines of the religion of the sword, a releion which Coes not make for
the peace or well bene of mankind; a religion, also, which assigning one of
the two sexes to the degraded position of being created solely tor the gross
pleasure of the other, does not make for the exaltation ot inankind.

To quote again the eminent avthority previously referred to: "No
Mahominedan race or dynasty has ever shown itselt able to vovern weil
even subjects of its own religion, while to extend equal rights to subjects of
a different creed is forbidden by the very law of its being.”

Not the Jewish conceit proclaiming itself God's clect and chosen, and
originating the name “heathen which it scorned. Not the Christian conceit
cimanating from the Jewish source, and laying the flattering unction to its
soul of superiority over the “heathen "of its own time. Not the unbending
vaste exclusiveness of the Brahman across whose path even the shadow of
the despised Sudra falling would be deemed detilement. Not any of these,
can equal the intolerant religious pride of the Mahommedan, or reach tie
pmnacle of religious selfsufticiency on which he has seated himself. “Vo be
a Mahommedan, is enough— Cela suffit.

To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahonimedans, and
inumate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahemmedan is above all things a Mahommedan. His
ichgion is the paramount question in his life, and remains its predominating
feature above everything else. This should not be surprising, since to the
faithful” Paradise is secured, and all crimes and transgressions against
“unbelievers” absolved.
