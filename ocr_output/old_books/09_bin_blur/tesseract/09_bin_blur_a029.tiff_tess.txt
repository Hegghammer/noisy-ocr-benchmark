PART OL
THE ARMENEAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY Ol BERIEIN.

Since the gathering of the Pleni otentiaries of europe at the famous
Coneress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the stll more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armentan nation stands withe ut
its parallel in history.

In the Guildhall at Berlin hanes a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1$7S. 0 The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of Europe,
but inthe taterests of Humanity there should be attached to that: painting
the wording of Article Gt of the Treaty of Bertin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).

Ir was a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of ‘the
terrible stronchoid of Kars,” universally admitted te be one of the vreatest
aud most difficult mittary exploits ever achieved, and the crowning sticcess
of the Russian arms ta Astatic “Vurkey, should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General; that although Armenian Generals ta the Russian
service had led to conquest, and Armenian soldiers fought, conquered aud
died, yet by these successes not only was ne amehoration attained of the
hard fate of their unbappy nation under Turkish rue, but that fate, hard
before, was made a hundredfold and even a tiousandfold harder.
