the ones T passed Taaw that the portholes
were open and that Uie water could not have
bees more than a few fect from them. Here

dinary Uhat the portholes on the lower decas
should not have been clorad and sealed as we
stearned Uhrough the war zone. At lonecheor
the portholes an the dining saloon on deck
DD were open, and so To doubt) not that
all the others on that deck were open.
