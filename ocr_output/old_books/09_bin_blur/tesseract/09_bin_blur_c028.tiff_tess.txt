THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
arms from around my neck, and my_ brothers
kissed me farewell. Then the man from the
strange boat opened the door of our wattled house
and went out, and I followed him.

We did not go back to the place where he had
left his boat of brass. We went to another place
where there was a harbor with ships. There we
found a ship ready to sail for Urth.

My master sent me on board to ask the cap-
tain if he would take us on a voyage beyond Urth.
The captain said that if my master would guide
them past the Magnetberg he would give him the
ship to sail where he would after the cargo had been
landed. My master said he would do this, and we
went on board the ship. It was evening now, and
a breeze came up, and the ship sailed away,
bringing me from the place where I was born and
reared and toward the strange countries that were
beyond the rim of the sea. I asked one of the
sailors what was the Magnetberg, and he told me
that it was a mountain of loadstone that drew the
iron out of ships that came near it and left them
loosened timbers upon the water.
