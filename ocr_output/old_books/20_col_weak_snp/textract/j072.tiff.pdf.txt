SEAT WEAVING
wrapped completely around the rails, for otherwise it would prove
practically impossible to weave the area because of the thickness
of the reed. A winding reed as shown in Fig. 49 or binder cane
could be run continuously, inasmuch as either is relatively thin.
Weaving with two kinds of reed will produce an area of pleasing
high relief.
FIG. 57. DIAMOND DESIGA IN FLAT KEED.
Fig. 57 illustrate< a stool woven in tlat reed. The diagonal
weave is used running toward a common center, and ît forms a
diamond pattern or design. Begin wrapping un the long rails,
skipping every other strand on the top as indicated. To weave this
pattern if is necessary to locate the center of the short rails and
the center strand of those running across the frame. In this instance
the strands are even in mumber, so the pattern does not begin at
the actual center, but a little to the right or left as the case may bc.
Beginning at the center, count by twos, oper, under and over, under
and so on to determine the number of strands to go over or under
