PRINTING,
My object in writing this little book is to lay the hard case of my un
fortunate race betore the men and women of the United States since it is
from the United States that the American Missionaries have forth, who

the sulphur tlames of religious fanaticism burst, the lava floods of race hatred
and lust of plonder, break forth and run in fiery streams; the untortunate
victims are pounced swooped upon, pillaged, plundered, butchered,
slaughtered, subjected to outrages SO hideous, cruel, loathsome, and revolt-
ing, that no pen could depict their horrible realities and the details can never
go into print. The human mind is staggered and asks itself the question if
even the imaginations of fiends and devils could originate such horrors.
Then this orgy of the homan fiends is arrested. For the time being the
appetite for blood, lust, and plunder is satisfied ; for the time being, the eye
is content with the scenes of havoc and desolation lying under the sun ; the
