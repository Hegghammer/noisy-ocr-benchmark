PREL VCE.
No one, we apprehend, would be likely to deny that, to enable the
fairer portion of the civilised human race to follow the time-honoured
custom of presenting to the eye the waist in its most slender pro-
portions, the Corsut in some form nust be had recourse to. Our
information will show how ancient and almost universal its use has
been, and there is no reason to anticipate that its aid will ever be
dispecsided with S() long as an elegant and attractive figure is an object
worth achieving.
Such being the case, it becomes a matter of considerable importance
to discover by what means the destrable end can be acquired without
inmuy to the health of those whose forms are being restrained and
moulded into proportions generally accepted as graceful, by the use and
influence of the Corset. It will be our duty to lay before the reader
the strictures of authors, ancient and modern, on this article of dress,
and
it
will be seen that the animadsersions of former writers greatly
exceed modern censures, both in number and fierceness of condemnation.
This difference probably arises from the fact of Corsets of the most
unyielding and stubborn character being universally made use of at the
time the severest attacks were made upon them: and there can be no
reasonable doubt that much which was written in their condemnation
had some truth in it, although accompanied by a vast deal of fanciful
exaggeration. It would also be not stating the whole of the case if we
onnited here to note that modern authors, who launch sweepiug
mathemas on the very stays by the aid of which their wives and
daughters are made prusentable in society, almost invariably quote
Largely from scribes of ancient date, and say litile or nothing, of their
own knowledge. On the other hand, it will be secn that those
