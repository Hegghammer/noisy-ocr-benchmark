THE CORSET AXD THE CRINOLINT,
ringuishable from the real stones, were within the reach of the humblest
classes, whose passion for finery could not be surpassed by their supcriors.
The richily carved and embroidered sandals, ticd over the instep with
tassels of gold, were surmonnted by gold anklets or bangles, which, as
well as the bracelets encircling the wrist, sparkled with rare genis; and
necklaces of gold or of beantiful beads, with a pendant of ametbysts or
pearls, hung from the neck. Almost every finger was jewelled, and the
rign finger in particular was usually allotted several rings, while massive
earrings slraped like hoops, or sometimes taking the form of a jewelled
asp or of a dragon, adorned the ears. Gloves were used at a very early
date, and unong the other imperishable relics of that olden time the
tombs of Egypt have rendered up to us a pair of striped linen mittens,
which once covered the hands of a Theban lady.
"Women of quality inclosed their hair with a band of gold, from which
a flower drooped over the forchead, while the hair fell in long plaits to
the bosom, and behind streamed down the back to the wnist. The side
hair was secured by combs made of polished wood or by a gold pin, and
perhaps was sometimes adorned, like the brow, with a fayourite flower.
The toilet was furnished with a brazon mirror, polished to such a degree
as to reflect every lineament of the facc, and the belles of Egypt, as
ladies of the present day may imagine, spent no small portion of their
time with this faithful counsellor. The bondoirs were not devoid of an
ar of lusury and retinement particularly congenial to a modern imagina-
tion. A stand near the unglazed window supported vases of flowers,
which filled the room with delicious odours: a soft carpet overspread
the floor; two or three richly-carved chairs and an embroidered
fauteuil afforded casy and inviting seats; and the lotus and papyrus
were frescoed on the wall. Besides the brazen mirror, other acces-
sories of the toilet were arrunged on the ebony table, and boxes and
caskets grotesquely carved, some containing jewels, others furnished
with oils and ointments, took their place with quaintly-cu smclling.
