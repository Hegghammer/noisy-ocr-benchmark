TITE CORSET IXD TIIE CRINOLINE.
"Item: Pro ix ulnis radii. Pariensis pro robas astivas corsetto et clochia

The persons 10r whom these garments were made were Richard,
King of the Normans, and Edward, his son, whose death occurred in the

gentlemen as well as ladies.
The term kirtk, so often referred to, may not clearly convey to the
mind of the modern reader the nature of the garment indicated by it,
and therefore it may not be amiss to give Strutt's description of it. He
says, "The Kirtle, or, as it was anciently written is a part of the
dross used by the men and the women, but especially by the latter. It
was sometimes a habit of state, and worn by persons of high rank." The
garment sometimes called a "surcol" Chancer renders kirtle, and we
have no reason to dispute his authority. Kirtles are very frequently
mentioned in old romances. They are snid to have been of different
textures and of different colours, but especially of green; and sometimes
they were laced closely to the body, and probably answered the purpose
of the bodice or .aunfal, before referred to -
"Their kirtles were of rede cendel,
I had smalle, jollyf, and well."
To appear in a kirtle only seems to have been a mark of servitude.

courtesy waited at the table-

In Kirtle alone she served in hall.':
We are further informed that at the close of the fifteenth century it
was used as a habit of penance, and we read that Jane Shore, when
performing penance, walked barefoot, a lighted taper in her hand, and
