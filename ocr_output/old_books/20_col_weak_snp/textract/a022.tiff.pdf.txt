of the Porte have been unreasonab.v forgotten OF neglected. they are fully
as wretched as the Slays or Cremas have been ; and in SO far worse of1,
that in Europe there exists no large Lody of tribes making murder and
robbery its regnar and dally occupation as the Kurds, and latterly the
Circassians also, have done in Armenia. If anyone will take the trouble
to
read the complaints of oppressions and crucltics presented to the l'orte
by
the
Armeman Patriarchate in ST2 (sinco reprinted in England) and some of
the
more recent statements brinted 213 the Armenians in England on the
same topic, he will see that the stato of Furkish Asia presents as grave and
pressing a problemi as that of Bulgnra itscif."
In the ith cdition of the samic book, published in 896, the following
note appear to the passage I have quoted:
Shorth after this was written, the Dluc Books presented to l'arlia-
ment, containing reports from British Consuls in \siatic Turkey, showed
that things were really far worse there than thes had been in Bulgaria or
Her/cooyim.
What has followed since ist6 is too well known. For sceking redress

and killed like rats and flics during the Hamidian régime.
You will toil me, christian friends, that with the rise of the relorm
party in Turkey, of massacres is at an end, and I will tell you that
the
conditions of 1876 and 1896 have not actually changed, though they
man seemingly appear so to the and uninitiated. I will
answer
you that the hideous massacres of April last happened months
after
the
reform
party first rose in rower, and nine months after the of
the Constitution. I do not question the goodwill of the reform party, but
the reform party docs not compuise the whole Turkish nation, and
until
the
Turk learns to become liberal, cit ilizeil and hou.an, there may be
no
more
Armenians left, unless some Christian Power such as the United States
demands their protection and enforces it. Xot my Christian friends, it can
be well for other Christians in the Turkish Empire with their powerful
Governments at their back ; but ales: there is no security for a subject
people alien in race and religion.
The massacres in tril last raged from Adana to Alexancretta, and
iccording to authent-cated reports about fifer thousand men, women and
children were hidconsly exterminated : more than this, the last massacres
were especially characterized by the most bidcous, the most loathsome, the
most revolting and ferocious cruelties perpetrated on women and children.
Yow what other name can we find for the perpetrators of this diabolical
