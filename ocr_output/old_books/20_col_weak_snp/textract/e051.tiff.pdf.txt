Fairies, and attendant ladies are described. OF two of the latter it
is said-
Then kirtles were of rede cendel,"
1 laced smalle, jollyf, and well,
There might none gayer go."
In the French version of the same poem it is, we read, more fully
expressed. It says, "They were richily habited and very tightly laced."
The Lady Triamore is thus described.
"The lady was in a purple pall,
With gentill budyc and nucalle small")
Wharton quotes from an ancicht pocmi, which he belieres to date as
far back as 1200, in which a loyer, speaking of the object of his
admiration, thus throws down the gauntlet of challenge, and exclaims -
"Middle her she hath mensk small."
The word mensk or maint being used instcad of very or nuch. Some
differences of opinion have existed among writers as to the origin of the
word corset. Some are of opmion that the Fronch words corps, the
body, and serrer (to tightly inclose or incase), led to the adoption of
the term. Madame La Santo gives it as her opinion, however, that it is
more probably a corruption of the siagle word cGips, which was formerly
written cors, and may be taken as a diminutive form of it. Another
view of the matter has been that the name of n rich material called
which was at one time extensively used in the manufacture of
corsets, may have been thms corrupted. This is scarcely probable, as
the word corset w.is III use at too early a period to admit of that origin.
Perhaps as early an instance of the use of the term corret as any in
existence may be found as a portion of an entry in the hou chold register
of Eleanor, Countess of Licicester, which bears the date May 24, 1265 -
A rich description of silk.
