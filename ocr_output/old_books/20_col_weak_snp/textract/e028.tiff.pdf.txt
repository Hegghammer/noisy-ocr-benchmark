The Persians entertain much the same notions with regard to the
necessit< for slenderness of form in the belles of their mation, but differ in
other matters from the Hindoos. The following illustration represents a
dancing-girl of Persia, and it will be seen that her figure bears no
indication of neglect of cultivation. It is somewhat curious that the
Chinese, with all their extraordinary ingenuity, have confined their
restrictive efforts to the feet of the ladies, leaving their waists unconfined.
That their doing SO is more the rosult of long-established custom than
absence of admiration for elegantly proportioned figures will be clearly
proved by the following extract from a letter published in Chambers'
Journal, written by a genuine inhabitant of the Colestial Empire,
named Woo-tan-/lon, who paid a visit to England in 1844-45. Thus
he describes the ladies of England:-
" Their eyes, having the bline tint of the waters of autumn, are
charming beyond description, and their wausts are laced as tight and thin
as I willow branch. What, perhaps, canglit my fancy most was the
sight of degantly-dressed young ladies, with pearl-like necks and right-
laced waists; notling can possibly be so enchanting as to see ladies that
compress themselves into taper forms of the most exquisite shape, the
like of which I have never seen before."
By many writers it has been urged that the admiration SO generally
folt for and taper waists results from an artificial
taste set up by long custom; but in Woo-tan-zhip's case it was
clearly not so, as the small-wausted young ladies of the "outer
barbarians" were to him much as some new ind undescribed flowers or
birds would be to the wondering naturalist who first behell them.
