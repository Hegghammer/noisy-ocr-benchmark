The efforts of the Armenians, and of then Patriarch
Nerses had procured the insertion of Article 16 in the Treaty of
San
Stefano signed between Russia and Turkey in March 187S. In fact the
wording of the Article had been suggested bj the Patriarch himscif. It
provided the following stipulation for the protection of the Immenians : -
"As the evacuation by the Russian troops of the territory which they
now occupy in Armenia, and which is to Le restored to might give
rise to conflicts and complications detrimental to the maintenance of
good
relations between the two countries, the Sublime Porte engages to carry
into
effect without further delay the improvements and reformis demanded
by
local requirements in the provinces inhabited by the Armentans, and
to
guarantee their security against the Kurds and Circassiarts.
What followed has unssed into bistory. The British Government of
which Lord Beaconsfield (then Mr. 1) Israeli) Prenvier, and Lord
Salis

aggrandizement in Turker. Afraid that her OW11 real or fancied interests
would therchy Lecome imperilled, England threw in the weight of her power,
and
virtually

immediate protector, both able and desirous of enforcing the rotection which
the Armentans then had in Russia, was taken away, and the security of im
potent words given in its stead. namely
The Sublime Porte undertakes to carry ont without further delay the
improvements and reforms demanded by local requarements in the provinces
inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the
Circassians and Kurds. It will periodically make known the steps taken to
this effect to the Powers, who will sitperiatend their application,
It will pricadically make known the stips taken to this frect to the
Powers, 20/10 well subcrintend their application." How this last proviso
could furnish food for laugliter were it not for the terrible tragedy involved
in it.
The insertion of Article GI in the Treaty of Berlin, granted, or rather
scemingly granted, by the six l'owers of Purope, proved in reality, as sub-
sequent events hore Olt, an instrument of death and torture. It was
as
if
the reversal of the figures had reversed the possibilities of succour and
protection, and with the death of the Czar Liberator, the last chance of the
Armenians died.
The Turkish Massacres of 1875 and 1876 which led up to the Russo-
Turkish War of 1877 are historical facts too well known to need further
