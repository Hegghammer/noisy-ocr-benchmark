the last space will be a short 1/2 in. or whatever dimension is used.
In such cases it is necessary to redivide the las: several spaces into
divisions as near 1/2 in. as possible. It thus becomes obvious why
spacing must be done in one direction as stated. This applies to
all rectangular frames.
With a 3/16 in. wood bit bore holes thru the rails and stiles at
the points marked. Countersink the holes slightly on the underside

holes, and in other ways. In shops where
power machinery is available a vertical borer
may be used for this purpose. Ir is best to
carcfully mark the points for boring with a center punch. The
twist bit will then start accurately and the danger for getting out
of line will be reduced to a minimum. The dimensions given here
are for fine-fine cane. Use sandpaper to reinove pencil lines and
rough edges left from horing; then clamp the frame over the edge
of a table or bench with a carriage clamp; sit while doing the
weaving.
The Seven Steps in Caning.-Fig. + shows the seven steps in
caning. Refer to this photograph thrtout the following directions.
The numbers on the photograph refer to the steps.
Step 1. A hank of cane should be soakei] for a few minutes in
warm warer, or longer in cold. Do not soak it too long. Start a
strand br drawing one end thru a hole nest to a corner hole, and
let it project about 3 in. below. Fasten with a peg. Then starting
