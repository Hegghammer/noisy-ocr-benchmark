CHAPTER 1
CANJXG; Tru SEVEN STEPS
That caning has not been undertaken to any appreciable extent
in school shops is due to the fact that instructors are unfamiliar
with the weaving processes Caning is not difficuit. Ir. in common
with many other lines of activity, is best learned thru observation.
However. it may be undertaken by the average person after careful
study of printed directions and illustrations. If the worker will
closely observe his own work as it progresses. and follows instruc-
tions carefully, he should have no unusital difliculty in caning an
area very acceptably in the initial attempt. Particular attention
should be paid to directions which rell of errors to avoid. Errors
creep in, in a very unobtrusive marnner at times, and the amateur
will find them hard to detect.
Cane.-Cane is the name applied to a great number of plants
which possess long, slender. reedlike stems, The name should apply
only to a class of palms called rattans. These plants are found
thrunut the Indian Archipclago, China, India, Ceylon, and the
Malay l'enínsula. They grow in dense, dark forests and form a
matted undergrow th which makes passage difficult or impossible.
These paims are trailing in tendency, yet frequently grow to tree
height. Thes then fall over and lie on the ground. The stem is
covered with beautiful green foliage, grows to a length of 11X) tu
300 ft., and rarely excreds 1 in. in diameter. The stems are cut
into lengths of 10 to 20 ft. for export. The outer bark is stripped
into widths varying from 1/16 to 3/16 in. These strips are put
into banks of 1,000 lineal feet each. The cane is then ready for
the cane weaver. A hank of cane costs from 60 cents to $1. The
width of the cane and its quality determines the price per hauk.
It may be purchased from any upholstery supply house.
