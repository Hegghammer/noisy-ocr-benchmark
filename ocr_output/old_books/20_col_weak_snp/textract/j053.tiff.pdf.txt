the other. Considerable force needs to be exerted in packing, and
caution used to avoid breaking strands.

initial process is repeated at all corners until all openings are filled.

those on the long rails. Weaving around corners is then manifestly
impossible. Fig. 42 shows a partly woven seat with the short rails
filled, and the process of filling up the remaining area under way,
The method is this: Go over and under a long rail, across half the
frame opening and up thru, then across the remaining distance, and
over and under the other long rail. Repeat until the scat is com-
pleted. Fig 43 is a sketch of a partly woven seat, illustrating the
incthod of filling in the center just described. It supplements the
photograph and makes the method clearer.
It should be noted that the strands in crossing at the center must
be compressed one-balf of their diameters. They will need to be
tapped sharply with a mall maller or hammer to produce proper
crowding. Fig. 44 shows a stool seat of fiber woven by an eighth
grade bov, Fig. 45 shows the complete stool. The seat is woven
