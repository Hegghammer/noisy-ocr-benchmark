smell of corpses is in the air, the odor from the carenses of the "chrisuan
swine" reek in the nostrils of the Turk, he torns away, his jaws dripping with
blood, and rests to couch for a future spring. We have seen that sort of an
end to the tragedy of a tiger's victim : the tiger has caten his fill, he rests,
to keep guard over the crunched Lones and mangled bits of bloody flesh that
bestrew the carth. So also now there is a residue left of those that have
served ES the meat and wine of this devil's feast the demons have grorged

Civilized nations have received a temporary moral shock, like a shock
that spreads from the centre of an explosion ; the electric vibration running
far and wide from the scene of the centre of devastation. There are among

Generous and kind hearted people who open your purse strings: would

to God entreat, Y's would raise up your voices and demand that this people
of 211 industrious, intelligent christian race, robust in mind and body, should
be let to live. Would to God I entreat, that ye would raise your voices

Public Sentiment has done great things in the world's history. Public
Sentiment liberated Grecce, The Lebanon, The Balkan States from Furkish
Oppression. Slavery was abolished in the United States throngh Public
Sentinient : but alas. does Pablic Sentiment sleep for this helpless Christian
