On the field the ever anm of Hitle Japan undermined Russia's
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
deleated and ever retreating of colossal Russia. At sea the ever
ictorious Japanese Fleet succeeded in completely annihmating the Russian
Plect. It was war such as the workd had never yet seen. The secret of
such astounding successes should be investigated and here I beg leave to
quote
from one of a series of articles in which 1 gave view to my opinions
during the Russo-Tapanese War. Japan may be likened to the bundle of
faggots in the fable firmly tied together one of larger dimensions in
the centre, the sovercign round whom the whole nation clusters, and all,
ruler and people tied torether by adamantine bands of patriotism.
hese remarks of mine were based on observations of actual facts. In
national
unity Japan stands as an object lesson to the world she furnishes
an example which the work needs to copy, and which a nation so politically
forlorn as ourselvos more than any other needs to copy
From the astounding success of lapan let 115 torn to the position the
Great Republic of the United States of America occupies in the world, and
take the lesson to heart of what Union can accomplish as we contrast their
present position with the position that the handful of puritan pilgrims occupied
when they first landed on American soil not quite three hundred years ago.
National Unity is extentest need it is the banner which must
raise un over onl national life. National Unity must be engraven on the
tablets of our minds and throl in the pulses 0.1 our hearts. There
are
mountains of ditriculties betore us. and it ever we must reach the goal we
can only do so by being bound togrether like the bundle of faggots in the
fable. with DO weakening or loosening of the bands. Then perhaps we
might more be able to get an independent footing on the historical soil
of our farthers, and perhaps once more rally round our own flag. A fapan-
ese lives for the State, not for himself: we have no State for which to live,
but let US live for our communities whilst we keep the hopc in our hearts
that communities into States.
We have grit and endurance in an unparalleled degree. but these
characteristics will profit us nothing il we are wanting in unity.
Let us remember that utterance of the Founder of our faith. In our
loyalty and allegiance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents of a
cataract, but we must remember I lis warning utterance -
shall it profit a man." What shall it profit a nation. Unity is
the soul of a nation. Let us keen our soul and not lose it.
