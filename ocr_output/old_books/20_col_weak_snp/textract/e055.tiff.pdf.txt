having only her kirtle upon her back. John Gower, however, who
wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus describes a company of
ladics. They were, says he, 'clothed all alike, in kirtles with rich capes
or mantles, parti-colourcd, white, and blue, embroidered all over with
various devices." Their bodies are described as being long and small,
and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though each of them
had been a queen. We fiud that the tight-l;teed young ladies of the
court of the Lady Triamore "had mantles of groen-coloured velvet,
handsomely bordered with gold, and lined with rich furs. Then heads
were neatly attired in kerchiefs, and were ornamented with cut work and
richly-striped wires of gold, and upon their kerchiefs they had each of
them a pretty coronal, embellished with sixty gems or more;" and of
their pretty mistress it is sud in the same poem, that her cheeks were as
red as the rose when it first blossoms. Iler hair shone upon her head
like golden wire, falling benenth a crown of gold richly ornamented with
precious stones. Her resture was purple, and her mantle, lined with white
crininc, was also elegautly furred with the same. The Princess Blanche,
the daughter of Edward III., the subject of the annexed illustration,
appears to have copied closely the dress above described, and, like the
maids of honour of the Lady Triamore herself, she is not only richly
habited but thoroughly well-laced as well. Thus we sec, in the year
1361, the full influence of the corset on the costume of that period.
There is another pocm, said to be more ancient than even
which, no doubt, served to give a tone and direction to the fashicns of
times following aftcr. Here we find a beautiful lady described as
wearing a splendid girdle of beatén gold, embellished with rubies and
emeralds, about her middle small.
Gower, too, when describing a lover who is in the act of admiring
his mistress, thus writes:
He seeth hir shape forthwith, all
Hir bodye round, hir middle small.'
