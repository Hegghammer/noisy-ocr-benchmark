16 HALFHOURS WITI THE HIGITWAYMEN
entrusted to her keeping by a farmer attending
the market. To convince Ratsey how trusted
a person she was, she foolishly showed where she
had placed the bag ; and as soon as her back was
turned he had taken it from the cupboard where
it lay, and made off.
When the farmer returned and wanted his
money, there was the very deuce to pay. lle and
the landlady went off to the nearest justice and
swore an information against Gamaliel, who was
arrested and thrown into prison, but not before he
had found time to return home and bury the bag
in the garden. In confidence he told his mother
where it was hid, his mother told his sister, his
sister told her husband, her husband told his
friends, and so at last the confession reached the
ears of the justices. Gamaliel would undouhtedly
have been hanged ()I) that occasion, only he broke
prison and eseaped, clad only in his shirt.
His further adventures with Snell and
Shorthose, two companions of like inclination,
are in themselves amusing when reduced to less
stilted langutage than that of the Life. Curiously
enough, one of these incidents is concerned with
the robbing of an actor, whom Ratsey bids deliver
his money first, and a scene from Hamlet after-
wards. So it was not from any want of acquaint-
ance with the best models that the unnamed
author of Ratsey's life failed to put life into
his narrative. The incident is treated in as dead
and wooden a manner as the rest.
