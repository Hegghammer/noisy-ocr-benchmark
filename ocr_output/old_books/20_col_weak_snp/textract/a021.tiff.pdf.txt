earth is other nations: Docs Humanity, dous Christianty allow that tender
babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and butchered
before
the
CYCS of their mothiers, or that the cars of mothers should be rent
with the cries of the dying agony of their murdered children?
Does
Humanity, does Christianity allow that helpless women should be forcibly
subjected to the most bidcons, the most loathsome, the Inlost revolting, and
the
most
crucl ontrages? Docs Mumanity, does Christianity, allow all this.
Christian Government have organized a Ilagare Conference of l'ance
and Civilization, but they have. closed its doors to the caus't of a blecding
christian
race groaning under the voke of the cruellest oppressors that the
world has yet known. Christian men and women have held up their hands

the
very
heavens, but realiv, our political and commercial jenionsies provent
and we cach one of 115 being 011 the look ont lest our separate political and
commercial interests in the Empiro of your oppressors be endangered, car-

Christian l'owers should be all gathered together, one agamst another,
in
the
Empire of you Oppressors, as cagles wather to gether round a carcase; but
really there is no help for it; and if you nittst die hidcously by at hellish
extermination, why then you nust die, and we have to condone your hellish
extermination, for in any cise, each one of US secure his own political
and commercial interests in this same Empire of your Oppressors
