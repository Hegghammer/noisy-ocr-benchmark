I will again pass over the periods rulcd by the successors of Amasia,
and relate the >tory of Kity Armm, who ended his brilliant reme in .C.
796 aiter ruling over Armenia filty cight years.
He was a great and powerfol prince, and extended his dominions, and
grew to be so mighty in battle that the weighbouring nations called his
country Aramia and the people wert: called Aramians, such names as
Armenta or Armentans being no doubt later corruptions.
The first victory of Aram was over Neuchar king of Media, whom lie
took prisoner and put to death, and made a large part of the country of the
defeated prince tributari to his own. The second victory of Aram was OVCT
Barsham king of Babylon, whom also be took prisoner and put to death.
The next victory was oxer the kine of Cappadocia ; the army of the
Cappadocians was pursued to the very shores of the Mediterranenn, and the
whole of Cappadocin fell into the hands of Aram B.C. 1796. Also Ninus
king of Assyria, at one time an eager enenuy, the victories of Aram,

much of the story and histori of the people was lost and destroved alono
with the destruction of their independence it would be ditticult now to calculate
or assert, but in taking up link bu link of whatever knowledge has been left
to us, there seems to be gronnds for supposing that the
designated foreign writers as til people of Semitie race language and
religion, coming from Northern Arabia and settling in the region between
the western Loundaries of Dabylonia and the nighlands of Western Asian
were no other than the Hainho under their King Aram had spread their
conquests and their kingdom into Mesopotamia and even to the shores of
the Mediterranean.
Herodotus also rather curroborates this conjecture when he includes
Northern Mesopotanila, together with the mountamous country of Ararat,
under the name OT Armema, and in writing of the Armentan boats that
brought merchandise to Babylon, nc remarks that they were constructed in
Armenia, in the parts abont Assyria.
Archacological researches hare laid the claim that the madern Armenans
are descendants of the old Hittites : the modern Armenian being supposed
