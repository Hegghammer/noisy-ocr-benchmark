la making a studty of my race, I have found thrce marked characteristics
Combined with these three characteristics
is an intense Love of Nationality, 11c lire in a complex world. In an
independent people these characteristics and this sentiment are laudable
Virtues. In a subject people they are Crimcs.
Viter I had lail this bitter Truth tru heart, I did not have to scek for the
Why and 11 herefore of the Armentau Nassacros.
The Armenian Massacres stand without their parallel in history. The
human mind staggers to contemplate the frendish orgies of which they have
been the victims and no pen can describo their horrors : and this he)pless
christian puople are to-day in the same deadly peril as they have been sinco
the tamous Preaty of Herlin consigned them bound hand and foot to the
mercy of their executioners.
The Armenians may be led again si as sheep to the >laughter" and the
work of externitation may be Christ was crucified on
Calvary and the servant is not greater than his Lord-but the work of their
extermination can only be completed when the evil influences in the Turkish
Empire have reached their culaminating point. I Titherto the Powers of
Enrope have by their jealousies and rivalries cultivated these ovil influences,
they have watered them and made them grow, but when their culminating
point is reached, they must re-act on Christendom and the natural
consequence must follow. Those who sow the wind, mest reap the whirl-
wind. It is in the natural order of things.
1 will allow that I iberty, Justice, Equality, Fraternity are the watchwords
of Young Turkey, Mit Young Turkey is only a small minority ; the great
majority of the Turkish nation are not Young Turks.
The question therefore resolves itself into this critical point "What will
Christendom do even now?"
