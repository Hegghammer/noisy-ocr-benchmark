Can the Armentans hope now for any changy in then concitton under
Turkish rule? To this question, we nust answer an emphatic No!
The causes that must operate against any change are many and deep-
seated. In the first place it cannot be expected that it few Turks of liberal
ideas (or it may be I rench polished) at are going to change
the thought and character of the nation. T he characteristics of a people
change very slowly, if they ever change at all, and the predominant national
traits of the many blooded modern Turk have been shown to the world to
be, cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a fierce sensuality : and
what
is
more than all, and which has to be remembered most, is, that they are
a
poople accustomed to the unbridled gratification of their worst 1
assions.
The thnographic traits of the Turkman which history bears out, are
whdness and fiercencss, and it would not Lo incorrect to argue that with
the
instincts of his primitivo ancestors have been assimilated the cross
currents that run in his veins, into all of which has been infuscal
the
doctrines of the religion of the sword, a relicion which cous not make for
the peace or well being of mankind; a religion, also, which assigning one
of
the two sexes to the degraded position of being created solely for the
gross
pleasure of the other, does not make for the esaluation of mankind.
To quote agam the eminent acthority previously referred to : No
Mahonmedan race or dynasty has ever shown itseli able to govern weil
even subjects of its own relizion, while to extend equal rights to subjects of
a dificrent creed is forbidden by the very haw of its being."
Not the Jewish conceit proclaiming itsch Cod's elect and chosen, and
originating the name "heathen which It scorned. Not the Christian concuit
emanating from the Jewish source, and laying the Dattering unction to its
soul of superiority over the 'heathon at its own time. Not the unbending
caste exclusivences of the Brahman neress whose path even the sharow of
the despised Sucira falling would be deemed defilement. Not any of these,
can equal the intolerant religions price of the Mahommedan, or reach the
pinnacle of religious sell-sufficieney on which he has seated To be
a Mahonmedan, is enough-Cila sufjit.
To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Nahonmedans, and
intiniate with Manommictan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahommedan is alove all things a Mahommedan. His
religion is the paramonit question in his life, and remains its predominating
feature above everything else. This should not be surprising, since to the
"faithful" Paradise is secured, and all crimes and transgressions against
absolved.
