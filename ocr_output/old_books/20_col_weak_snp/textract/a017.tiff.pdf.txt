4s these sheets are goung through the press there comes news of famine
at Zeitoon. The Rev. 11. II. Macullam, American Missionary at Marash,
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet, Imerican Missionary at Constantinople, that
12,000 souls in and around Zeitoon are dying of hunger i they are wandering
about in rays, mixing bran and water, and cooking and eating it, if they can
get even that. Rev. Maculiam adds, "The same story comes to us from all
sides. .Is foresaw all along, from now 01) the distress will be greatest.
If 59,000 were massacred, the list of those who have died and are dying
of homclessness and starvation will excced 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerated Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.
The latest nows is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that
had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered in a nightattack
by armed Kurds, and the villagers are now reduced to extreme distress. Before
the outbreak the \rmeman patriarchal vichr at Mush had repeatedly appealed
to the Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
hall repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinopic asking protec-
uon for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehened It is
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armonian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
