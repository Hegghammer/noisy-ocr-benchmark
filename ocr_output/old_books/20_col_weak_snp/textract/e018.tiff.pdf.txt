TIIK TIE CRINOLINE,
behrs of the tribe were not stow in discovering that, which arraved
in ill the patoply of forest finery, a buli well drawn m, as shown in the
annexed illistration, served to display the figure to mach greater alsan-
tage than one carelessly or loosely adjusted. Here, then, we find the
first indication of the use of the corset as an article of becoming attire.
At the very first dawn of civilisation there are distunt ovidences of the
use of contrivances for the reduction and formation of the female figure.
Researches minong the ruins of Polenqui, one of the mysterious forest CITICS
of Sonth America, whose history is lost in remote antiquity, have brought
to light most singular exidences of the existence of a now forgotten
race. Amongat the works of art discuvered there is a bas-relief repre-
senting a female figure, which, in addition to a profusion of massive
ornaments, wears a complicated and claborate waist-bandage, which,
by a system of circular and transverse folding and looping, confines the
warst from just below the ribs to the lips as firmly and compactly as
the most unyielding corset of the present day.
At the period of the discovery of some of the islands of the
Eastern Archipelago, it was found customary for all young females to
wear a peculiar kind of corset, formed of spirtilly-arranged ratian
cane, and this, when once put on, was not removed until the celebration
of the marriage ceremony. Such races as were slowly advancing in the
march of civilisation, after discovery by the early narigators, became
more and more accustomed to the use of clothing, to adjust and retain
which, waustbiends would become essentially requisite. These, when
made sufficiently broad to fit without undue friction, and stiff enough to
prevent folding together in the act of stooping, sitting, or moving
about, at once became in effect corsets, and suggested to the minds
of the ingenious it system of cutting and fitting so as more perfectly to
adapt them to the figure of the wearer. The modes of fastening, as
we shall sce, have been varions, from the simple sewing together with
the lace to the costly buckle and jewellod loop and stud.
