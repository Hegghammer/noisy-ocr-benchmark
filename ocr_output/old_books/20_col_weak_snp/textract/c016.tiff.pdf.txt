THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
And that is the way that the story of The Boy
Apprentieed to an Enchanter used to begin.
But first I shall have to tell you about King
Manus and his three horses.
King Manus ruled over the Western Island, and
he had a castle that was neither higher nor wider
than any other king's castle. But he had a stable
that was more strongly built than any other King's
stable. It had double walls of stone; it had oak
beams ; it had an iron door with four locks to it.
And before this door two soldiers with drawn
swords in their hands stayed night and day.
In those days, if one went before a King and
asked him for a gift the King might not refuse to
give what was asked of him. But King Manus
was hard to come to by those with requests. For
before the chamber where he sal or slept there
stood a servant to take the request, and if it were
one that might not be brought to him. to make an
excuse for the King.
It was all becanse of the King's three horses -
a white horse, a red horse, and a black horse.
The white horse was as swift as the plunging wave
