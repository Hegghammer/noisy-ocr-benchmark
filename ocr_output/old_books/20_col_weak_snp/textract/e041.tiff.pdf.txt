Strutt informs 11S that the Roman women, married as well as
ummarried, used girdles, and besides them they sometimes wore a broad
swath or bandage round their breasts, called strophium, which seems to
have auswered the purpose of the bodice or stays, and had a buckle or
bandage on the left shoulder, and that the mitra or girdle of the Greeks
probably resembled the strophium of the Romans. The annexed

pastorals introduces a damsel complaining to a shepherd of his rudeness,
suying he had loosened her mitra or girdle, and tolls her he means to
dedicate the same to Venus. So it will be seen that the waist and its
adornment were considered at that early period of the world's history

zone, mitra, custula, stays, bodice, or corset is made use of, the end
sought to be obtained by their aid was the same.
Constant mention is made by early writers of the peplus as being a

Antinous presented to Penelope a beautiful large and variegated
peplus, having twelve bnckles of gold, with tongues neatly curved.
The peplus, however, was a very splendid part of the lady's dress, and
it is rarely mentioned by Homer without some epithet to distinguish it
