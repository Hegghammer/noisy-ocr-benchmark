Added to these important factors of racial influcences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenta another evil, from which the other provinces ofthe Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been excmpt this simper-added evil, is, the
large bodies of Kurds and Circassians, greater maranders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation of whose lives comprise.
murder and robbery, and who have thron h weary centuries unreinitthizly
quartered themselves upon the industrions christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits of the ir labour and toil. Indeed as the Hamidich cayairy which
was established expressly for the Unmidian nissacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation what Outlet these warriors,
trained
and practised in organized murder, can now find for those habits in
which they were encouraged and trained to indulgre Dy, the Hamidma
régime,
U Inder all such conditions no hope of better days can be fortlicoming
no prospect of better times seems possible, for that unhappy portion of the
Armenian race whom lorce of keaps on the soil of the
fatherland.
The appointment of Christian governors over the provinces in-
habited bus them might ameliorato some of the evils. or the other alternative,
of allowing the use of and to all alike, irrespective of creed or
nationality, would furnish some means of self-defence ayainst the raids
and barbarities of the oppressors; but even it such concessions were granted,
life for the christian peasant subject to Turkish mole, and living in the midst
of his ene mies, must renain one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Notthe most fartile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the most assiduous
industry. not the most peace loving, law abiding instincis, can bring to the
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
happiness, and security of life and property, which the law of all civilized
countries marantees to the industrious labouror and tiller of the soil.
