MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE
It will be seen by the engraving that the old house is double The
western part is that which was built by Barnaba, in 1659-60. The
ist or tave story part was built by Jonathan 1., about 1682. The upper
room of this part was used for a court house for nearly twenty years,
as we learn from Thompson's History of Long Island, and some of
the old benches used when it was a court house are still preserved.
The old castle," as Jonathan G. Horton, its last Hotion occupant,
used to call it, is in all probability the oldest wood house in America,
I know of no dwelling house of any kind, stone or brick, now stand-

were a few huts on the east of Long Islam previous to 10 fo-two or

the Paritans, immediately in their settlement in Southold, soon all
passed away Not a vestige of any of the first generation baildings
can be found except this one. It remained for the house that Barnabas
built to survive the wreck of ages, and to stand to-day as a noble
representative of the dwellings of two hundred and fifteen years ago.
But the old house stand in-day not only as peering above all others
by its age, but also by its oce aparev, It is not very often that we find
two generations of the same nine. living and dying in the same house-
rarely find three. But here we have six generations in succession, all
hearing the Horton name, living and dying in the same house, and
all born in it except Barnabas L., and his son Jonathan. We may go
to the castles and places of the old world, and search long and dili-
gently, and tail to find a parallel case.
With a few repairs, the old castle inay yet stand for generations far
in the future.
It repures some thought and reflection to realize the lapse of time
since the old house was built. See the old Puritan himself there
