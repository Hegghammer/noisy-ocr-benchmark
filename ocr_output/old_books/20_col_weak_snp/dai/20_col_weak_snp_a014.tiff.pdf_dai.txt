SCENE OF THE MASSACRES IN ASTA MINOR
The trouble began in Alama. An armed mob trengthened and augmented by oldiers
fell in overwhelsing numbers upon the marmed Christians. The Armenian population of
Antisch and vicinity were practically wiped out and the Armenian villages in the
Alexandretta district destroved with immense loss of life. Hadjin, Kessal and the neigh-
leuring villages were burneil, The Armenian arter in Tarsus was ruined and ill-omene
Marash stained again with the blood of thousands of Armenians, Zeitoon was desolated. The
entire population of Kirikon between Aleppo and Alexandretta were massacred to the last
habe. The mob and the soldiers burned what they could not carry away, so that the material
los has been enormous. In place of the former abundance and thriving industries there are
instead desolated provinces and the charred and blackened remains of pillaged and ruined
homes, and the resilue of those who escaped massacre are reduced to homelessness and
starvation.
