was a race up that time among non-Moslem peoples which with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottomat tathe land that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish lest, and recognize the
Ottoman outry as their fatherland, Besides this it is the Armeniaus wie eine in
commerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitless, increase the value of
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few among them justly startel un agitation, these our noble
and industrions brethren were being acred. What a terrible scene
When we

This sunking crime of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this like, thuring the
whole course of a cursed absolatis, up to the last moment, crew widere Even during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly tealings which had been shown,
the awill events in Alma took place and the souls of all true Osumulis melted into tears,
Up to the present time the deep arrow caused by this event has disappeared, because this
blonly wou in our social body cant sily be cured While we all our stomachs with
choire morsels, while we rest selfishly in our confortable heils, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans, widows himgry, naked, and barefoot wander hither and thither, and thousands
families are fleeing from the fatherland, We are convinced that the government is doing its
