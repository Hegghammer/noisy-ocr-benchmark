PART I
ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND
TREATY
BERLIN
THE
Since the gathering of the Plen, otentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 18-8, and tire signing of the still more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel in history,
In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of Europe,
but in the interests of llumanity there shonkl be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).
It was curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of the
terrible stronghold of Kars," universally admitted to be one of the greatest
and most difficult military exploits ever achieved, and the crowning success
of the Russian arms in Asiatic Turkey, should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General: that although Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest, and Armenian soldiers fought, conquered and
died, yet by these successes not only was no amelioration attained of the
hard fate of their unhappy nation under Turkish rule, Lut that fate, hard
before, was made a hundredfold and even thousandfold harder.
GENERAL PRINCE CORTS MELIKOFF
Commanded the Russian fores in Asiatic Turkey
daring the Russ Turkish war and captured the im-
pregnable fortress of Kars. Appointed Prime Minister
of Russia by Alexander I The liberal policy which
characterized the reign of that excellent monarch, and
the Constitution that he was on the eve of granting to
hipple were influenced by Melik it but after the
death of Mexander 11 he was not allowed to contine in
his good work of reforming Russia, being overthrown
from dlice carly in the rein of Alexander III.
