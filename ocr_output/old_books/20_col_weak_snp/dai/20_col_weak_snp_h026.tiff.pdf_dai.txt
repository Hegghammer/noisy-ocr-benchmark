Prelace --Introauction,
This hook is mains what those who have kindly furnished records
and sketches lave made it. The whole has been careilly compiled.
But genealogical works, almost of necessity, contain many errors.
Doubtless this small work has its ill-hare. But when erors are dis-
covered, notice thereof should be given, so that a second edition may
be made entirely truthful. Thank fil to all who have generously given
their assistance, this work is sent om as a small contribution to the
genealogical literature of the day, and in the hope that a more full
and extensive book of Horton chronicles may be issued at no very
listant (lay.
