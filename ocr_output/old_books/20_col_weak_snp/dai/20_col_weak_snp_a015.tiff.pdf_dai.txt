DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE.
I have thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested witnesses.
We are having a perfectly hideous time here. Thousands have been murdered 25,000
in this province they ey, but the under is prably eater, for every Christian village
was wipeout In Adana about 5000 have peri-hel. After Turks and Armenians had
made peace, the Turks came in the night with his and kerosene, and set fire to what remained
of the Armenian quarter. Next day the French and Armenian schools were fired. Nearly every
one in the Armenian chool prishot, anybody trying to escape beingshot down by the soldiers
â€œThe Turkish Authorities do nothing except arest untending Armenians, from whom
by torture they extort the most anciful confesiones Even the wounded are not safe front
their injustice. A man was being carried in to me yesterday when he was seized and taken
off to g. I dare not think what his tate may bo,
For tiends incarnate commend me to the Turks Noboly is safe from them. The
murder babies in front of their mothers: they half murder men, and violate the wives while
the hu-bands are lying there dying in pols of Hol."
The authorities did nothing, and the soldiers were worse than the crowd, for they were
better armed. One house in our quarter was burl with 115 people inside. We ented
the bodies. The subliers et fire to the door, and as the windows haud iron Jars, nobody
comid get on. Everybody in the house was roasted aliv, They were all women and
children and old people."Extract from letter of Mrs. Doughty-Wylie, wife of British Consul
at Adana ; publi-led in the London Daily Mail
IN THIS HOUSE 115 WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ROASTED ALIVE
History repeats its lf. In 1895 Turkish solliers fell upon seventy to eighty young
women and girl in a church, where they had tol for refugo, and after hideously outragin,
them, barricade them in, setting fire to the building at the same time, and derisively showing
to their victims as they were being roastel alive, to call upon their Christ to save them now
