of blackened ruins, the stark walls of the churches and houses rising up out of the ashes and
charrel timbers heaped on every side, What it it mean to the live thensul men and
women and little children who have survive a painful flight to the seconSE ud have now
returned to their mountain home, caly to find their houses sacked and burnel! There were
mine Christian villages which lustere i about Kesal in the valleys below. Several of these
have been completely destroyed by fire. I have been plaandere mol the helpless people
driven out or slain."
"Can you imagine the feelings of the Kesab people as they climbed on foot the Fair trail
up the ntain, and then as they came over the ridge into full view of their charf indl
ruinel dwelling Their stures of wheat, arley and rice had been burned clothing, king
utensils, furniture and tool had gone their goats, cows and males had been stolen; their silk
industries stamped out their beloved churches reduced to smouldering heaps. The bodies of
their friends and relatives who had been killed had not been Imried. And yet the love of
home is so strong that the people have settled down there with the determination to clear sp
the debris and rebuild their houses" Extracts from The Sack of Kessab," Stephen Van It.

As these sheets are going through the press there comes news of famine
at Zeitoon. The Rev. 1. W. Macullum, American Missionary at Marash,
writes to the Rev. W. W. Pect, American Missionary at Constantinople, that
12,000 souls in and around Zeitoon are dying of hunger; they are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran and water, and cooking and eating it, if they can
get even that. Rev. Macullum adds, "The same story comes to us from all
sides. As we foresaw all along, from now on the distress will be greatest.
If 50,000 were massacred, the list of those who have died and are dying
of homelessness and starvation will exceed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerated. Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.
The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered in a night attack
by armed Kurds, and the villagers are now reduced to extreme distress. Before
the outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeatedly appealed
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec-
tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It is
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
