HORTON ARMS.
DERBYSHIRE.
A stag's head cabossed, silver attired, gold; and, for distinction, a canton ermine,
Crest, out of the waves of the sea proper, a tilting spear erret, gout, enfiled with a dolphin,
silver, finned, gold, and charg d with a shell,
Cabossed means cut off short so as not to show the neck; attired denotes the hors; canton
ring, means the black spots upon the white field in the left hand commer. In the picture this
artist has not given the shell upon the dolphin.]
Motto. QUOD VULT, VALDE VULT," hat he wills, he wills cordially and without stint.
Arms are hereditary, but the motties are not, and may be changed to suit the taste or fancy of
my family. There are other Arms of the Horton family, varying somewhat from the above. The
date of the grant of the arms I have not found probably many contaries ago.
