In such cases it is necessary to redivide the last several spaces into

are for fine-fine cane. Use sandpaper to remove pencil lines and
rough edges left from horing; then clamp the frame over the edge
of a table or bench with a carriage clamp: sit while doing the
weaving.
The Seven Steps in Caning.-Fig. 4 shows the seven steps in
caning. Refer to this photograph thruout the following directions.
The numbers on the photograph refer to the steps.
Step 1.
A hank of cane should be soaked for a few minutes in
warm water, or longer in cold. Do not soak it too long. Start a
strand by drawing one end thru a hole next to a corner hole, and
let it project about in. below. Fasten with a peg. Then starting
