like a round bow, a great brown eye revealed the inward spirit's inteiligence and zeal un-
quenched. On his head was a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.
Thus, near the end of last ember, one of a century's greatest men--Marlitch
Khriman, Katholikes of the Armenian Church, and south of the Armenian periple-bowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or The Only-Govotion
is Descended." From the wind wat a neighboring room he might have booked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the viues were now all close and hurried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stol a dark mass of whirling now and hurricane that had the
cone of Aramat. And just beyond Ararat ies Lake Van, last puble of the Deluge. On the
Shore of that Jake, eighty-seven years ago Khriman was born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undimin-hed by sea or land; the Sultan still onned as one on the forund-
able Power of Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Greice from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of frevden
reputation which still rather pathetically survives Thought the Near East. Ling and
stermiy bad been the life upon which the Katholikos mo back, but not unhappy, for
from first to Inst it rad en inspired by one absorbing and ansch-haim-the freedom and
regeneration of his peoples It is true he had furthed.
From his carliest years, when he had witnessed the rors of Turkish oppresten in the
homes of Armenis und Ararat, ha was possessed by the spirit of nationality such a
spirit as only kimlles in oppressed races, but this away in vasyong teleraner among the
prosperous and contented of the world. He began as a poet, wambeing for and wide through
The Turki-, l'ersian, and asian sections of Armenia, visiting Com-tastinode and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his popic by his poems the sevnes and glories of their national history,
Emering the monastic order after his wife's death, he devoted him off to the building of chords,
which he generely threw open to Kurds, the nereditary assassin Armeniaus. For many
yours, while Farope was recupie with Crimsan wars, Austrian war, or French and formar
wars, we see him reaches journey from Van to Constantinople and through the
cities of Asia, unvielding in the contest, thraigh continually lotitel, his schools burned, his
printing press broken ap, his sacred eundens of the Host hung in makery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenian patriarch of Constantinople (1860, he was driven from
his office after our years.
But the cup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiles taughter of Bulgations and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. With variol motives,
Russia sent her armies to tight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khriman taunt
him. If samned to plead his people's caut before the Congress Berlin Though h
speaks 200 language but Arineta and Turkish, he visited all the great conut- of Europe
beforhand, urging them to create an autonomol urral state for Armenia, they hal
done with access to the Lebanon. In London his came acquainted with Gladstone
Gladstone was then only the blazine firebrand which had killed the heart of England, und,
in the Congress itsel Khriman rould gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, plaging the Powers, and specially England, to hold the Kards in check and
enforce Turkey definite reformis. It is needless to say that none f the promises and
pledges were observed, Beact-told returned to London amid shouts of Peace with Honor,
und Armenia was left to stew.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prismer, banishet toe Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, le
maintained the u peless contest. Year by year the wo increased, till by the last incalonlalde
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were laughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake
