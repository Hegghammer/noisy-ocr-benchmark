mother of Brutus, was presented with a pair by Julius Caesar, the
of which was 48,457:
Bracelets are also ornaments of high antiquity, as are rings and
_ brooches of various forms for fastening the dress.
Rich gold chains and jewelled fastenings were in common use during
this period. The annexed illustration represents a Roman lady of
rank about the reign of Heliogabalus. Little alteration appears
to have
taken place in the general style of costume for some very considerable
period of time, and the patrician ladies concealed beneath their flowing
draperies a kind of corset, which they tightened very considerably, for a
slight and tapering waist was looked upon as a great beauty in women,
âœ“ great attention was paid to the formation of the figure, in spite of
all that has been written about the purely natural and statuesque forms
of the Roman matrons. On the conquest of the Roman Empire by the
wild and savage Hunnish tribes, fashion, art, taste, literature, and civilisa-
tion were swept ruthlessly away, and a long, weird night of mental
darkness may be said to have reigned throughout the land from the
tenth to thank of he fifteenth century, aud we sea little or nothing
of Roman elegance or magnificence of dress to distinguish it above other
nations from that period.
