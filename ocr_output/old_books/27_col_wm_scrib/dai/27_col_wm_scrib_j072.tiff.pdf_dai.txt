SEAT WEAVING
wrapped completely around the rails, for otherwise it would prove
practically impossible to weave the area because of the thickness
of the reed. A winding reed as shown in Fig. 49 or binder cape
could be run continuously, inasmuch as either is relatively inin.

FIG. 57. DIAMOND DESIGN IN FLAT REED.
Fig. 57 illustrates a stool woven in flat reed. The diagonal
weave is used running toward a common center, and it forms a
diamond pattern or design. Begin wrapping on the ails
skipping every other strand on the top as indicated. To weave this
pattern it is necessary to locate the center of the short rails and
the center strand of those running across the frame. In this instance
the strands are even in number, so the pattern does not begin at
the actual center, but a little to the right or left as the case may be.
Beginning at the center, count by twas, wer under and over, under
and soon to determine the number of strands to go over or under
