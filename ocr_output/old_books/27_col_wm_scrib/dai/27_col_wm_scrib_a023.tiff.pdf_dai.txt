orgy, except to call them fiends incarnate; and who is the bold man
can guarantee that these same fiends incarnate have become meton of phosed
and changed all of a sudden; or that the handful of liberal Turks at Con-
stantinople are capable of controlling and restraining them. We have not
ever heard that the leaders and participators of the last massacres have
been punished as they deserved; and what is the reason they are left un-
punished? because the Government is afraid to punish Mahommedans for
killing Christians; because the liberal Turks dare not punish the "true
believers for killing "Kaffirs."
The religion of Mahommed, the religion of the sword, has been infused
into the Turk, and to understand the effect of the religion of Mahommed
upon the Turk, it is necessary to regard it from four aspects, or from four
points of analysis. First, the fundamental doctrine and law of the religion.
Second the character of the founder as an example to his followers. Third,
the racial and ethnographic characteristics of the Turk. Fourth, the effect
which this particular religion would be likely to have on this particular race
When we have viewed the Turk and his government from these four points
of analysis, we have the explanation of all the woe and desolation which
have lain over the countries under Turkish rule.
"When ye encounter the unbelievers strike off their heads until you
have made a great slaughter of them is a chapter of the Koran which the
Turk has religionly
Listly hade his dicet.
In conclusion, I will ask my readers to compare one point of difference
between the two races, the oppressor and the oppressed. Thousands upon
thousands of Armenian women, thousands upon thousands of Armenian
children, have been hounded to death, or savagely, ferociously, horribly and
loathsome matreated by the Turk, and yet in all the agonizing years when
Massacre has succeeded upon Massacre, has there been one known case or
one single instance of a Turkish woman or child maltreated by Armenians?
The last massacres though especially organized from the alate at
Constantinople, were officially announced to originate from an affray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single handed one on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other killed one of the three:
given equal numbers and arms, the Armenian is always a match for the
Turk, but alas for him that unequal numbers and want of arms have always
made him the victim of his oppressor.
Ahmed Riza Bey in the first part (Ses Causes) of his book "La Crise de
L'Orient" published in Paris in 1907 holds a brief for his nation which
through its own fallacious arguments falls to the ground. I will quote one
passage as an example.
