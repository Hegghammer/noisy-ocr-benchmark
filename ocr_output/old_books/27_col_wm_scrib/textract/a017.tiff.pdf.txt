of blackened ruins, the stark walls of the churehes and houses rising up out of the and
ating
charred timbers heaped on every side. What must it mean to the five men and
women and little children who have survived a painful flight and have now
returned to their mountain home, only to find their houses sacker and burned! There were
nine Christian villages which elustered about Kessab in the valleys below. Several of these
ho e been completely destroyed by tire. All have been plundered and the helpless
friyen ou or slain."
Can you imagine the feelings of the Kessab people as they climbed on foot the long trail
A the mountain, and then as they eame over the ridge into full view of their charred and
ruined dwellings ? Their stores of wheat, barley and rice had been burned ; clothing, cooking
utensils, furniture and tools had gone; their goats, cows and mules had been stolen their silk
industries stamped out their beloved churches reduced to smoulderir heaps. The bodies of
their friends and relatives who had been killed had not been buried. And yet the love of
home is so strong that the people have settled down there with the determination to elear up
the debris and rebuild their houses.' - -Extracts from The Sack of Kessab, Stephen Van

As these sheets are going through the press there comes news of famine
at Zeitoon. The Rev. F. W. Macullum, American Missionary at Marash,
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet, American Missionary at Constantinople, that
V
12,000 souls in and around Zeitoon are dying of hunger ; they are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran and water, and cooking and eating it, if they can
get even that. Rev. Macullum adds, The same story comes to us from all
sides.
As
we
fo
be greatest.'

If 50,000 were massacred, the list of those who have died and are dying
of homelessness and starvation will exceed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerated. Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.
The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered in a night attack
by armed Kurds, and the villagers are now reduced to extreme distress Before
the outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeated appealed
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patplarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec-
w
tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended.
It is B!
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders
