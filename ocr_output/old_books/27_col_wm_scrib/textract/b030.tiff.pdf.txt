CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

" It is in carnivorous animals, with whose habits and manner of life, ferocity is instinctively
connected, as the great means of their subsistence, that rage is distinguished by the most
remarkable strength of expression. The eye-ball is terrible, and the retraction of the flesh of the
lips indicates the most savage fury. But the first, is merely the exerted attention of the animal;
and the other a preparatory exposure of the canine teeth. The great animals of prey-th Lion
and the Tiger-are quite incapable of any other expression of featuré, than this particular display
of ferociousness. When they fawn upon their keeper, there is no motion in their features that
indicates affection."
In this assertion, that the countenances of the great animals of prey are incapable of any
other than ferocious expression, we do not quite coincide with our learned physiologist. When
they fawn upon their keeper, we think that indications of affection are exhibited and find
ourselves ready to ask what else than kindly expression is that " licking of the hand" which our
author has before mentioned. If, however, we should grant that they may not be capable of
affectionate expression toward their keeper, we can scarc ly doubt that-toward their young
if
we could observe them in their wild state, and in their moments of playful intercourse and
enjoyment among each other-the are: at least, we think there are motions in their features that
indicate affection, as well as fear, enquiry, surprise, gratitude, pleasurable wantonness, and some
other
sent we perceive that the
range of their ferocions expression far exceeds the savage circle of their domestic charities. Are
not even the least of these observable in the habits and manners of the domestic Cat, who belongs
to the Tiger genera But we have even seen a Tiger in his den, who looked good-natured enough
to be stroked and patte and of the Lion, of whom Mr. GRIFFITH relates the following anecdote,

" Hearing some noise under his cage, the Lion passed his paw between the bars, and actually
hauled up his keeper who was cleaning beneath but as soon as he perceived that he had thus ill
used his master, lie instantly lay down upon his back in an attitude of complete mission."
Or what can be said of the circumstance mentioned by SENECA (of whien h was personally

in the amplutheatre at Rome; and who was not only instantly recognised, but defended and

broken loose, submitting to the Cid, and allowing himself to beled back peaceably to his place of
confinement?
