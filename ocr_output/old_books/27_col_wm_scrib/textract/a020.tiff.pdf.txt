smell of corpses is in the air, the odor from the carcases of the christian
swine" reek in the nostrils of the Turk, he turns away, his jaws dripping with
blood, and rests to couch for a future spring. We rave seenchat sort of an
end to the tragedy of a tiger's victim : the tiger ha eater his fill, he rests,
to keep guard over the crunched bones and mangledbits of bloody flesh that
bestrew the earth. So also now there is a residue left of those that have
served as the meat and wine of this devil's feast ; the demons have gorged
thems lives over the banquet, and now, there are left over the broken remains
fithe banquet, the miserable residue homeless and destitute.
Civilized nations have received a temporary moral shock, like a shock
that spreads from the centre of an explosion the electric vibration running
far and wide from the scene of the centre of devastation. There are among
these civilized nations generous and kind-hearted people who open their
purse strings ; they give money to purchase shelter, food and clothing for
these froniel less, naked and. hungry beggars, made homeless, naked and
hungry through no fault of their own. But oh ! ye generous and kind heart-
ed people ! can any power under heaven assuage the heart anguish of thes
miserable residue? Can they be made by any means of human comfort tb
forget the black horrors or recover from the effects of the fires of the hideous
affliction through which they have passed? What is there left for a woman
who has seen with her own eyes the slaughter and heard with her own ears
the dying cry of her murd ered even her reason must give way under
the stress of her anguish. All ye who are mothers, I appeal to you, for one
moment to put yourselves in the place of thousands of such mothers, in
whose hearts the same mother's love burns as in yours, and then measure
the depth of their agony.
Gen
kind hearted people who open your purse strings would
to God I entreat, e would raise up your voices and demand that this hideous
slaughter and oppression of a helpless christian race should cease. Would
to God I entreat, ye would raise up your voices and demand that, this people
of an industrious, intelligent christian race, robust in mind and body, should
be let to live. Would to God I entreat, that ye would raise AP you voices
and demand for them that security of life and property to which they are
entitled just as equally as all other peoples.

Public Sentiment has done great things in the vorld's history. Public
Sentiment liberated Greece, The Lebanon, The Balkan States from Turkish
Oppression. Slavery was abolished in the United States through Public
Sentiment : but alas ! does Public Sentiment sleep for this helpless Christian
race, Are they not God's creatures'havetheyntatight to live on God's
