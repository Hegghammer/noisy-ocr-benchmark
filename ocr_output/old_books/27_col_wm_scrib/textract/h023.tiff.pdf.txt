Jeremiah also settled in Massachusetts. There was a John Horton in
New York, in 1645, but no one has been found claiming descent from
him. He probably returned to England.
It is not known from what place in England either Thomas or Tefe
miah came, nor is there any certain evidence that th were others
of Barnabas, but the three coming over about the seme time would
favor the tradition that they were brothers.
The Head Quarters of Cassar's army was near the present Leicester,
the principal town of that county, and the Horton name has been
nown there to the remotest period of any authentic records.
his
fact, together with the name itself, favors the idea that the family was
of Roman origin. The name in olden time was frequently written
Orton, and it is highly probable, that the Ortons and Hortons were
originally from the same family, and perhaps also the Nortons.
ANTIQUITY OF THE HORTON FAMILY
The antiquity of the Horton Famili is established by the fact, that
one Robert De Horton, manumitted a bondman to his manor of
Horton, long before the time of Henry Larey, Earl of Lincoln, who

Charles I., the estate of Howroyde, was born about 1576.
2. Joseph, born about 578.-Burke's Landed Gentry, vol. 1, $ p 3 455.
It is held that this Joseph settled in Mousely, Leicester
was the father of Barnabas Horton. It is highly probable that
Co., WB, Bar- an
nabas was not the oldest son, and not inheriting feal estate, may have
been one reason for his emigrating to America.
It is known that Capt. Jeremy Horton, 18 Aug., 1626, was the
master and owner of the ship " Swallow," of Barnstable, and that he
made voyages to New England, in 163: and 1638, and in a subsequent
voyage he was shipwrecked and several lives lost-the crew and master

Capt. Roger Horton, about this time, had a prisoner delivered to
