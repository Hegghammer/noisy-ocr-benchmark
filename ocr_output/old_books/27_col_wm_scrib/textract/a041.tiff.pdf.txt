Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people-slowly
Thus, near the end of last December, one of a centu fash men-Mgrditch
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmuatzin or The Ouly-Begotten
Descended." From the window of a neighboring l'oom he might have looked across the
frost bo nd plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now all eut close and huried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling suow and hurricane that hid the
cone of Ararat. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
of that lake, eighty-seven years ago, Khrimian was born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land ; the Sultan still countedas one of the formid-
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom-a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives thronghout the Near East. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos now looked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to last it had been inspired by one absorbing and unselfish aim-the freedom and
his people. It is true he had failed
From his carliest years, when lie had witnessed the terrors of Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality-such
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance among the
prosperous and contented of the world. He began as a poet, wandering far and wide throug
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jernsalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wife's death, he devoted himself to the building of schools,
which he generously threw open to Kurd the hereditary assassins of Armenians. For many
years, while Europe occipios with im wars Austrian wars or Fronch and German
wars, we see him ceaseless journeying from an to Constantinople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emblems of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenian patriarch of Constantinople (1869), he was driven from
his office after four years.
But th
ish iniquity was filling. The pitiless slaughter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to plead his people's cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great cou of Curope

pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London sl stits of Peace with Honor,'
and Armenia was left to stew.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like slicep from the Bosporus to Lake
