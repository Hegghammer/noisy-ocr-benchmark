Dun. He is the child of the ages. Equally with
Robin Hood, every generation, until the decay
folklore, added some new touch to him, and
Johnson did but reduce him to print, add a little
more, and shape him out of the somewhat formless
|
but threatening figure he presented.
There is this much basis for him : that, on
the site of the town of Dunstable, and for some
distance along one dynead hoad in that direc-

encouragement a new town was fourded, and in
1131 given, with the rights of market, to a priory
that had been founded in the meanwhile. The
King himself had a residencer at Dunstaplia,"
