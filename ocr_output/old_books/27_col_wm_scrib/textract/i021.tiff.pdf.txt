THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
paredness towards emergency. I was keenly
interested in all that was done aboard ship as
we approached the Irish Coast, an m fact all
through the voyage I kept my eyes unusually
wide open.
At night the shades in the saloon were
closely drawn, and I noticed that my bedroom
steward left a note for the night watchman
stating just which ports were open when he
(the steward) went off duty.
Friday noon yhen the run was posted I
|
was surprised, for I certainly thought that
this was the time to put on speed. The sea
was smooth as a pancake, an ideal chance for
Z
a dash up the coast. When I heard the fog
horn early Friday morning I turned over and
took another snooze, for there was no use in
getting up if it was foggy and disagreeable
weather. The fog did not last long and was
nothing more than a morning mist
ABBI
I got up at noon and had time for a stroll
