THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
And that is the way that the story of The Boy
Apprenticed to an Enchanter used to begin.
But first I shall have to tell you about King
Manus and his three horses.
King Manus ruled over the Western Island, and
be had a castle that was neither higher nor wider
than any other King's castle. But he had a stable
that was more strongly built than any oth r King's
stable. It had double walls of tone; it had oak
beams; it had an iron doo. with four locks to it.
And before this door wo soldie. IS with drawn
swords in their han ds stayed right and day.
In those days, if one went before a King and
asked him for a rift he King might not refuse to
give what was asked of him. But King Manus
was hard to come to by those with requests. For
before the cha imber where he sat or slept there
stood a servant to take the request, and if it were
one that might not be brought to him, to make an
excuse for the King.
It was all because of the King's three horses
DB,
white horse, a red horse, and a black horse.
The white horse was as swift as the plunging wave
