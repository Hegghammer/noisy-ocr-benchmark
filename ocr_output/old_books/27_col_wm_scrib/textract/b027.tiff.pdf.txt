IN this GROUP by MR. EDWIN LANDSEER there is much of violent niimal Expression, and
Character fades before it, or rather, is absorbed in it. It tells a story of the past as well as the
pr esent and is pregnant with a catastrophe not difficult to anticipate from the actions and
9
expressions of the parties engraged. A FAWN has been seized by a LEOPARD, who has been
espoiled of his prey by a more powerful TIGER. The Tiger in his turn becomes the victim of an
enraged LION.
The expression of the wounded Leopard is that of painful suffering mingled with dread.
Together, they amount to agony. He shrieks while he submits. The Tiger is still enraged and
resisting, though astounded with the power and suddenness of the Lion's attack. Heis losing his
energy of resistance, and is beginning to feel that all resistance is vain. He roars with anguish;
while his expression is that of terror, and indignation not yet subdued.
The Lion, who has just made his thundering spring, appears conscious of having fatally seized
his adversary, and luxuriates fearlessly in his victory ; and with a powerful and just expression of
carnivorous enjoyment.-Meanwh the characters of the animals. severally, are faithfully and
specifically represented.
Although our main purpose be to exhibit rather pictorial than a physiological view of the
subject: having descanted on the word Character we shall probably be expected to add, at least
a word or two, on the leading characteristics of the carnivorous class of quadrupeds.
The generic charad and thum In the concise
language of the naturalists. Their heads are round; their visages short : they have six cutting
Z
teeth, and two canine, in either jaw their tongues are aculeated, the prickles inclining backward
their claws sharp, hooked, and retractile ; their ears small and acuminated; they have five toes on
each of the fore-feet, and fourionly on those behind.
Of this genera of Uats, WE here exibit the four principal species, Lions, Tigers, Leopards,
and Panthers, of which the Lion is justly placed at the head-at least, the unanimous voice of ages
has pronounced him to be the king of beasts, and we have enthroned him accordingly in our Title-
page, (No. I.) They form tribe that is especially and properly Carnivorous, being the olly
class of quadrupeds that are exclusively flesh-cater8. Their jaws are very completely armed for
this purpose; their canine teeth being very long and angular, with the edges of the angles turned
toware the inside of their mouths; so that when the animal has caused them to meet, or cross each
B!
other in the flesh of its prey, these formidable teeth will cut or tear
way through, by drawing
them back without opening his mouth.
Their claws, and the formation of their feet, too, are eminently conducive to their predacious
