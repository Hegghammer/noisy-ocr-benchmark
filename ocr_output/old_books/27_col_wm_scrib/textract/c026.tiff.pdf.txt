THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
I went in and stood on the floor of our house my
heart was thumping within me at the thoigh of
what was before.
And there was the pot boiling over the fire V\ ith
a few green herbs in it. There was Sab. my
mother, stirring the last handful of mea amongst
the green herbs. And there were my brothers,
all older than I, sitting by the fire, waiting for
the herbs and the meal to be eady
When my mother lo oke d towa .d us she saw the
man from the strange boat. She thought that
some crime had 1 cen commi tied by me or my father
to bring a man of suc h high degree amongst us.
She an m were greatly afraid, for they
were poor, and those who were high were harsh
to them. But the stranger spoke softly, saying,
"Good for une has come to you from the sea
to-day." And when they all turned toward him
he said, "I who am very knowledgeable will take
your son with me as an apprentice, and
shall
instruct him in arts and crafts

My mother said, "The boy is young, sir, and we
thought he would be with us for a time longer."
