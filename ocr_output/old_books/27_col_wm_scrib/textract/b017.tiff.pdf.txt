CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
Every artist does best, that which he is best qualified and best disposed to do. In com-

distinction between CHARACTER and EXPRESSION, we shall now deliver our opinion.
By the Claracter of an animal, we mean those permanencies of his look and features which he
always offers to view when in a placid, or unimpassioned state : by his Expression, the variations
of muscular action superinduced on character, to which he is liable, as the storms of passion sweep
by, and his mind becomes agitated by external circumstances acting on the ardours of his instinct.
The former, seems to hold its court in the solid and massy parts the latter, agitates, oft-
times rebelliously, the nerves and muscles. Character is ever present, both in the animal coun-
tenance, and in the " human face divine." The most violent expression does not proscribe, or
nam Individuality consists of it, as far as concerns xternal appearance; and it
forms the system of vowels of the language of Nature, without which no Expression could be.
Whoever regards the faces of a flock of Sheep, will see in them an infinite variety of Character,
with very little Expression, and that little withont diversit : and if we descend a step lower in
the scale of being, and contemplate the finny tribe, where Character s not wanting, we find no
Expression at all. Even Trees and inanimate objects, possess Character. We recollect a poetical
friend of ours, now in Italy, saying that every tree and every rock had a faee-bu of this we are
not so certain; though very certain, that therei enough of Character in rocks and trees, to make
a poet think so.

Character and Expression, in the carnivorous class of animals, to which we here solicit
attention, are always co-existent - their proportions varying with the existing occasions-in
pictorial exhibitions of such subjects.

THERE is much Character, and little Expression, in the reposing Leopard with his sheathed
claws, which is shewn in the present engraving, copied by Mr. SPILSBURY from RIDINGEA
corrected from Nature RIDINGER was an artist of great power, who studied wild apima) in
their sequestered haunts, as is shewn in his grand forest back-grounds and who, generall
speaking, left little or no room for others to improve, except on some lew of his inferiór works.

The present is an interesting and beautiful animal, yet there is allatent apability of mischief
characterised in his countenance, and we might ask, in the language of Job " Who shall dare to
rouse him up ?"
