a consideration of the necessities and voluntary exertions of the animal. With the
observer, it has been asserted, that it is by experience alone that he distin masis the signs of the
passions; that we learn, while infants, to consider smiles as expressions kindness, because
they
are necompanied by acts of beneficence and by endearments; and frowns as the contrary, because
e find tham followed by blows; that the expression of anger in a brute, is only that which has
been obser ed to precede his biting and that of fondness, his fawning and licking of the hand.
Vith regard to the creature itself, it is said, what has been called the external signs of passion, are
merely the concomitants of those voluntary movements, which the passions or habits suggest; that
the glare of the Lion's eye, for example, is the consequence of a voluntary exertion to see his prey
more clearly- - his grin, or snarl, the natural motion of uncasing his fangs before he uses them.
This, however, is not quite true of all animals and of all expression of passion,
" Attending merely to the evidence furnished by anatomical inv estigation, all that I shall
this that a remarkable difference is to be found between the anatomy and
range of expression, in mail and in animals : that in the former there seems to be a systematic
provision for that mode of communication and that natural languag which is to be read in the
changes of the countenance: that there is no emotion in the mind of man which has not its
appropriate signs; and that there are even muscles in the humar face to which 110 other use can be
assigned than to serve as the organs of this language that, on the other hand, there is in the lower
animals no range of expression which is not fairly referable as a mere accessary to the voluntary
or needful actions of the animal ; and that this nccessary expression does not appear to be in any
degtee commensurate to the variety and tent of the animal' passions.

"There appears to me (continues Mr. BELL) to be no expression in the face of any animal
lower in the scale of being than quadrupeds and in them the strongest and most marked
expression is that of rage; the object of which is opposition, resistance, and defence. But on
examination it will be found _ consistently with the position, that this is merely an accessary of
the motions natural to the accomplishment of the object which the animal has in view) that the
strength of the expression is in exact proportion to the strength of the principal action in the
creature when thus excited
