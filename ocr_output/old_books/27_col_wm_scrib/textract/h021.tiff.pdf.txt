THE OLD BIBLE.
Perhaps the most interesting relic left by our good old ancestor,
Barnabas, is the OLD BIBLE, which he brought with him from England.
It is now in the possession of the Hon. Silas Horton, of Southold.
It was taken to the Bible House, New York, some yeams ago,

OLD MUSKET, CASK, AND WALKING STAFF.
The old wood hooks are still attached to the big beam of the old
