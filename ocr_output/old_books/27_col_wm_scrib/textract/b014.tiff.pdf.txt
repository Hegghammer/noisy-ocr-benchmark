CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
the scene of which, by the way, he has not represented as a royal menagerie, but as wild,
ating
rocky cavern-his animals partake of the artificial character of which we sontoring ourselves to
approve.
Of this fact, however, we purpose to exhibit proof with ur assertion. Improved versions, to
far
the best abilities of our Artists, of some of these Lions of RUBENS and the Assyrian king, will here
be introduced, which the reader, who pleases, may compare with the originals. Our second, third,
and fourth Plates are of the number.
The Lions of RUBENS are humanized. We do not intend to discuss at length whether the
ideality of allegorical painting required this: we only state the fact: yet the opinions which we
felt at liberty to form on the subject, we feel at liberty to utter. So much in apology for using the
licence of asserting that the heads of many of the Lions of RUBENS rather resemble those of frowning
old grentlemen decorated with Ramillies wigs as if Nature's journey men had made manes, and not
made them well. There is a profusion of flowing and curling hair, which seems rather to solicit
inguents of the perfumer, than to have endured the torrid heats of the desert, or the rough
storms of the forest. The shag of a Lion's maneisa very different sort of thing.
However such dressed Lions may be thought to accord with Allegory, they are demonstrabl
at variance with Nature. To be sure, what might become a Lion in the procession of the Cardiral
Virtues, might be rather unsuitable in lis den, or within the precincts of those wild haunts, where he
is
accustomed to roam in his naturá state. We have often read of the fabled Men-bulls, or (Mino-
taurs,) and we find such on the comage of Crete. These allegorical creatures of RUBENS, which,
alas
! have sometimes been moted by Irtists without half his genius and placed in savage con-
flicts, or beside their Britamias are species of Men-lions. Placed among the Sabwean seulp-
tures, they might pass for incamations of Sol in Leo; but would very ill pass for Leo alone.
Among the observers of this poetic improvement, or this natural and unpoetical deficiency, on
the part of RUBENS, TITIAN, JULIO ROMANO, and other painters, both ancient and modern; and
of the consequen desideratum on the part of the public, of a cabinet or library collection of the
nobler wild animals in a state of Nature, so as to auswer the purposes of reference, while they con-
duced to the pleasure of Taste, were Mr. EDGAR SPILSBURY and Mr. THOMAS LANDSEER.
Whether or not the public "looked up to them for light" on that subject, (to usa the language of
STERNE, they thought the Public " deserved it;" and they therefore, as the Dest, pracical means
of eliciting that light, first copied the general forms and attitudes of most of the Vild miniak that
appear in this book, from the old masters-generally speaking. from works tha are well knowi
and then, went to Nature and corrected the details The carried with them what, in t Tose
B.
ancient masters, was meritorious in composition, attitude and chiaroscuro, and brought away,
to the best of their ability-superadding it to, and Olendin it with, the above-accuracy of
detail.
