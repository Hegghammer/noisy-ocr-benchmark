Preface.-Introduction
This book is mainly what those who have kindly furnished records
and sketches have made it. The whole has been carefully compiled.
But genealogical works, almost of necessity, contain many errors
Doubtless this small work has its full share. But when errors are
covered, notice thereof should be given, so the a secont edition may
be made entirely truthful. Thankful to all who have generously given
their assistance, this work is sent out as a small contribution to the
genealogical literature of the day, and in the hope that a more full
and extensive book of Horton chronicles may be issued at no very
distant day.
Terrytown, 10 Jan., 1876.
