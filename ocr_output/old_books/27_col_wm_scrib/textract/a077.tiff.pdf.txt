I will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amicial,
awating
and relate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant in B.C.
J 796 after ruling over Armenia fifty-eight years.

He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his dominions, and
grew to be so mighty in battle that the neighbouring nations called his
country Aramia and the people were called Aramians, such names as
Armenla or Armenians being no doubt later corruptions.
The first victory of Aram was over Neuchar king of Media, whom he
took prisoner and put to death, and made a large part of the country of the
defeated prince tributary to his own. The second victory of Aram was over
Barsham king of Babylon, whom also he took prisoner and put to death.
The next victory was over the king of Cappadocia the army of the
Cappadocians was pursued to the very shores of the Mediterranean, and the
Whate of Spadocia fell into the hands of Aram B.C. 1796. Also Ninus
king of Assyria, at one time an eager enemy, awed by the victories of Aram,
sought to cultivate his friendship.
No doubt if the volumes and scripts of paper or parchment of the famous
V
Alexandrian library, which burned for six months as fuel in the four thousand
baths of the city, had escaped that most atrocious act of vandalism, and been
preserved instead, vast treasures of knowledge now lost to us concerning
the ancient day ; and also
when the tide of Islam victory rolled over the kingdom of Armenia, how
Z
much of the story and history of the people was lost and destroyed along
with the destruction of their independence it would be difficult now to calculate
or assert, but in taking up link by link of whatever knowledge has been left
to us, there to be grounds for supposing that the Aramcans
designated by foreign writers as a people of Semitic race language and
religion, coming from Northern Arabia and settling in the region between
the western boundaries of Babylonia and the highlands of Apia'
were no other than the Hai who under their King Aram had sorgad their
conquests and their kingdom into Mesopotamia and even to the sholes
the Mediterranean.
Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when he includes
B1
Northern Mesopotamia, together with the nountainous country of Ararat,
under the name of Armenia, and in writing of the Armenian boats that
brought merchandise to Babylon, he remarks that they were constructed in
Armenia, in the parts above Assyria.
Archœeological researches have laid the claim that the modern Armenians
are the descendants of the old Hittites the modern Armenian being supposed
