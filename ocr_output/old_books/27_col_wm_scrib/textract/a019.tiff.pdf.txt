INTRODUCTIOA
TO 2ND PRINTING.
My object in writing this little book is to lay the hard case of my un-
fortunate race before the men and women of the United States ; since it is

peace and lent for ever.

just in that way; the subterranean fires are always there, but all of a sudden

go into print. The human mind is staggered and asks itself the question if
even the imaginations of fiends and devils could originate such horrors.
Then this orgy of the hnman fiends is arrested. For the time being the
