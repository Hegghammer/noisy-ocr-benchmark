Avert Thy gaze,
O THE God, ZONE close tight/Thine eyes!
Glance down no longer on the ocean foam,
Lest Thou behold such horrors as can turn
Men's burning hearts to ice, and chill their souls.
Keep Thine heart warm and full of charity
That Thou mayst yet be able to forgive,
And pity feel for those who know not when
To pause in deeds of ruthless sacrifice.
|
Restrain Thy wrath, and keep Thine hand in
check;
Smite not, nor fiercely thrust without the pale
Thost with Mare to strew the ocean waste
Z
With fellow creatures, innocent of wrong.
Forget the studied purpose to destroy;
The launching of the missile through the deep;
Theshattered hull; the crushed and bleeding forms;
The
seething swirl of wreckage, women, men. NB
