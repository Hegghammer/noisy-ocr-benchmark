destruction, and Golitzin was sent to Tiflis as governor-general to earry it out. Church

to give up the kers of the safe where the title deeds were kept (June, 1903). For two years
the Russian officials played with the revenues, retaining cighty per cent. for their own
advantage. But in the mean time assassination had rid the earth of Plehve, and the over-
whelming defeats of Russia in Manchuria were attributed to the Armenian eurse. Grudgingly
the Chureh property was restored, in utter chacs, and for the moment it is Russia's policy to
favor the Armenians as a balance against the Georgians whom the St. Petersbarg government
is now determined to destroy.

back that winter's morning. Singleness of aim has its reward in spiritual peace, but of the
future he was not hopeful. He no longer even contemplated an autonomous Armenia, either
on Turkish territory or on Russian. On the Russian side of the frontier the Armenian
villages were too seattered, too much interspersed with Georgians and Tartars, to allo
of autonomy. On the Turkish side, he thought, massacre and exile had now left too few of
the race to form any kind of community. Indeed, for the last twelve years the Armenian
villagers have been crawling over the foot of Ararat by thousands a year to escape the Kurds,

to concede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian villages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Cancasus ins

beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and industries. One cannot vet say how far their infl en

Whatever may be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
