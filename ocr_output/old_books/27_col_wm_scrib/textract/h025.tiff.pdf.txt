NOTE.
The reader will see at a glance the plan of this book. We com-
mence with the Christian name. Then follows the parentage, genea-
logical data, &c., and then the Christian names of the children and
order of births. In many of the early families the exact order
births cannot be ascertained; but it has been approximated as nearly
as possible. The lineage is given in connection with the first member
NBB of
of the family. The Roman numerals indicate th of births.
The sons and daughters of the old Puritan, Barn has, constitute the
second generation, but they are spoken by way of eminence as Joseph
I., Hannah I., &c. The book contains much repetition, but none
too much to make it plain and easy to study.
This little book contains the chronicles of only about one-half of
the Horton families looked up. Those whose genealogical data are
giten only in a small part, and those whose correct lineage has not
been satisfactorily ascertained, are not included in this book.
