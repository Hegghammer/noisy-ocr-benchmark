FACE-INTRODUCTION
Ne give BARNABAS HORTON as the Preface and Introduction to this
little volume of Chronicles. He was probably the son of Joseph
H orton, of Leicestershire, England, and born in the little hamlet of
Mousely of that shire. Of his history before he came to America very
little is known. He came over in the ship 12 Swallow," in 1633-38
He landed at Hampton, Mass. How long he remained at Hampton
is not known. But in 1640 we find him with his wife and two chil-
dren in New Haven, Conn., in company with the Rev. John Youngs,
William elles, Esq., Peter Hallock, John Tuthill, Richard Terry,
Thomas Mapes, Matthias Corwin, Robert Ackerly, Jacob Corey, John
Conklin, Isaac Arnold, and John Budd, and on the 2ISt day of
Oct., 1640, assisted by the venerable Rev. John Davenport and Gov.
Eaton, they organized themselves into a Congregational Church, and
sailed to the east end of Long Island, now Southold. They had all
been members of Puritan churches in England, and all had families
with them except Peter Hallock They ubtless had been on the
Z
island previous to this time and looked out their homes. On nearing
the shore they cast lots to decide who should first set foot on the land.
The lot fell on Peter Hallock, and the place where he stepped upon
the land has e ice been known as Hallock's Landing.
On coming ashore, they all knelt down and engaged in prayer,
Peter Hallock leading, as had been determined by the lot. These
were the first persons of any civilized nation that had ever attempted
to settle on the east end of Long Island. See Griffin's Journal.
Barnabas Horton was a man of deep-toned piety, and a warm
cate of civil and religious freedom. He was one of the most
promi- allvo BB.
nent and influential men of Southold. He was for any years
a
magistrate, and several times a member of the General Court at New
Haven and Harford. He built the first framed dwelling-house ever
erected on the east of Long Island, and that house is still (1875)
standing and occupied. It is a shingle-house, that is, shingles are
used for weather-boards, and the stats have never been reshingled,

and the roof but once, according to the statement of Jonathan Gold-
smyth Horton, the last Horton occupant of the old house.
