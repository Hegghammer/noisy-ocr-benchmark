HISTORICAL SKETCHES OF
"square fort with bastions" at what is now
called Barrancas, which he named San Carlos.
As the beginning, or rather reconstruction of a
lar
town named Pensacola, he erected some ho uses
adjacent to the fort. And there, too, was built
a church, historically the first ever erected on
the shores of Pensacola Bay, but presumpti ely
the second; for it is hardly c dible that the
large settlement of de Luna, e nbra cing so many
ecclesiastics, should have failed to observe the
universal custom of the Si ana ds to build a
church wherey er the lante 1 a colony. Irre-
|
sistible, therefore, is the inference that the first
notes of a ch ur h-bell he ard within the limits of
the ited Sta es were those which Tolled over
the waters of Pe usacola Bay and the white
h 11s of Santa Rosa from 1559 to 1562.
laving demonstrated that the settlement of
de Luna was the original Pensacola, that of
Arriola was apparently the second, though
actually but a resuscitation of the colory of
1559; for the name, the people, though not the
