THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.
British Museum bears on it the strange and anomalous figure represerved
couting
in the annexed illustration. Opinions vary somewhat as to whether
its origin might not have been Italian, but we seano reason for adopting
this view, and consider it as of decidedly home production. It will be
seen that the shoulder, upper part of the arm, and figure are those of a
tyell-formed female, who wears an unmistakable corset, tightly laced, and
stiffened by two busks in front, from one of which the lace, with a tag
at the end, depends. The head, wings, tail, feet, and claws are all those
of a demon or fiend. The drapery is worn so long as to render large
knots in it requisite to prevent dragging on the ground. The ring held
in the left claw is of gold, and probably intended to represent a massive
and costly bracelet. Produced, as this MS. appears to have been,
during the reign of Edward the Confessor, there is little doubt that
it was a severe monkish satire on the prevailing fashion, and a most

drapery, and Strutt, whose work was published in 1796, thus writes of

the thirteenth century, and probably much prior to that period, a long
and slender waist was considered by our ancestors as a criterion of
elegance in the female form. We ought not, therefore, to worder/if it
