Preface.-Introduction
It is said that Barnabas Horton I. was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities.
His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stong
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G
It is elevated about eighteen inches from the la a a good stone
base. The original base was of brick, but it and all crumbled down
many years ago. The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Horton.
The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads as
follows:
Here lieth buried the body of MR. BARNABAS HORTON who was born at
Mousely, Leicestershire, Old England, and died at Southold, on the 13th day of
July, 1680, aged 8o years."
the centre of the stone we find the E pitaph, as follows:
" Here lies my body tombed in dust
'Till Christ shall come to raise it with the just;
My soul ascended to the throne of God,
|
Where with sweet Tesus now I make abode:
Then hasten after me, my dearest wife,
To be partaker of this blessed life;
Hear and obey His public sacred word;
Z
And in your houses call upon His name,
For oft I have advised you to the same:
Then God will bless you with your children all,
And to this blessed place He will you call."
Heb. xi 4 He being dead, yet speaketh."
It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted, Avas all'put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the origiral
ArB
thirteen who brought his tombstone with this fact seems to
indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and memory
should not perish from the earth.
