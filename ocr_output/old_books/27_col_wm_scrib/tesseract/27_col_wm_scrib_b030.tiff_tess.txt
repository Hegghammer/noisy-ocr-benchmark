8 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. ny
the position of the head. In all gramnivorous animals, the skin of the head is closaly hed to
the skull, and capable only of very limited motion: the eye iflmost un} fy"mnild, and the lips
unmoved by passion.
« Tt is in carnivorous animals, with whose habits and M&nner of life, ferocity is instinctively
O comecttd, as the great means of their subsistence, that rage is distinguished by the most
remarkable strength of expression. The eye-ball is terrible, and the retraction of the flesh of the
lips indicates the most savage fury. But the first, is merely the exerted attention of the animal ;
and the other a preparatory exposure of the canine teeth. The great animals of prey—the Lion
and the Tiger—are quite ineapable of any other expression of feature, than this particular display
of ferociousness. When they fawn upon their keeper, there is no motion in their features that
indicates affection.”
In this assertion, that the countenances of the great gnimals of prey are incapable of any
other than ferocious expression, we do not quite coincide with our learned physiologist. When
AA upon their keeper, we think that indications of affection are exhibited; and find
ourselves rendy to ask what else than kindly expression is that “licking of the hand” which ouy
author has before mentioned. If, however, we should grant that they may not be capaple Af
affectionate expression toward their keeper, we can scarcely doubt that—toward their youn if
we could observe them in their wild state, and in their moments of playful intercourse and
enjoyment among each other—they are: at least, werthink there are motions in their features that
indicate affection, as well as feat, enquiry, surprise, gratitude, pleasurable wantonness, and some
other sentpagetn spree RLeaOrN COPA PAL_spreAy we perceive that the
range of their ferocions expression far exeeeds the savage circle of their domestic charities. Are
not even the least of these obsevyable in the habits and manners of the domestic Cat, who belongs
to the Tiger genera? But we have even seen a Tiger in his den, who looked good-natured enough
to be stroked and patied: and of the Lion, of whom Mr, Grirrrri relates the following anecdote,
phateennctemenn! J thouglit? :
“Tearing some noise under his cage, the Lion passed his paw between the bars, and actually
hauled up his keeper who was cleaning beneath ; but as soon as he perceived that he had thus ill
used his master, he instantly lay down upon his back in an attitude of complete ytymissipn.”
Or what can be said of the cireumstance mentioned by SENEcA (of whifh hg wag personally
witness), ofa Lion, to whom a man, who had formerly been his keeper, wasfexpqped "uctioy
in the amplutheatre at Rome; and who was not only i tly recognised, de¥ended fnd /
