belles of the tribe were not slow in discovering that, whep array
in all the panoply of forest finery, a belt well dragyn in, ag Tin the
annexed illustration, served to display the figure ficH greiter adyan- |
ge than one carelessly or loosely adjusted, re, then, we find whe
t indication of the use of the corset as an article of becoming attire. |
the very first dawn of civilisation there are distinct evidences of the
se of contrivances for the reduction and formation of the female figure. |
Researches among the ruins of Polenqui,.one of ‘1c mystcrious forest cities |
of Sonth America, whose history is lost in remote autiquity, have brought
to light most singular evidences of the existence of a now forgotten
race. Amongst the works of art discovered there is a bas-relief repre-
Z female figure, which, in addition to a profusion of massive
ornaments, wears a complicated and elaborate waist-bandage, which,
by a system of circular and transverse folding and looping, confines the
waist from just below the ribs io the hips as firmly and compactly as
the most unyielding corset of the present day.
At the period of the discovery of some of the islands of the
Eastern Arghipauge 4 sastoup_Lausiaparfonall young females to
wear a peculiar kind ot corset, formed of  spirally-arranged rattan
cane, and this, when once put on, was not removed until the celebration
of the marriage ceremony. Such races as were slowly advancing in the
|  march_of cjyilisation, after discovery by the early navigators, became
more and more accustomed to the use of clothing, to adjust and retain :
| which, waistbands would become essentially requisite. These, when
mace snfficiently broad to fit without undue friction, and stiff Aapugl} to
prevent folding together in the act of stooping, sitting,/or/ movin
about, at once became in effect corsets, and suggested t6 t ids /

dapt them to the figure of the wearer. e mfdes of fastening, as
we shall see, have been various, from the simpl€ sewing together with
the lace to the costly buckle and jewelled loop and stud.
