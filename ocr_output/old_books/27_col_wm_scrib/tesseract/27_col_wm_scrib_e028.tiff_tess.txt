The Persians entertain much the same nif ith regard to the
necessity for slenderness of form in the belles oP their nation, but dificr in
ther matters from the Hindoos. ‘The following illustration represents a
ancing-girl of Persia, and it will be seen that her figure bears no
indication of neglect of cultivation. It is somewhat curious that the
Chinese, with all their extraordinary ingenuity, have confined their
restrictive efforts to the feet of the ladies, leaving their waists unconfined.
That their doing so is more the result of long-established custom than
absence of admiration for elegantly-proporticned figures will be clearly

Yournal, written by a genume inhabitant of the Celestial Empire,
named Woo-tan-zhin, who paid a yisit to England in 1844-45. This
he describes the ladies of England :—
| “Their eyes, having the blue tint of the waters of autumn, are
charming beyond description, and their waists are laced as tight and thin
as a willow*Auaebe ibat_ palapsnrcaugbL aL Ape most was the

By many writers it has been urged that the admiration so generally

taste set up by long custom; but in Woo-tan-zhin’s és} it) was
