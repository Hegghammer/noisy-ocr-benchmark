British Museum bears on it the strange and anomalous figure pr,
in the annexed illustration, Opinions vary sqfpew! © whether |
its origin might not have been Italian, but we segfio reason for adopting
his view, and consider it as of decidedly home production. It will be

yekll-formed female, who wears an unmistakable corset, tiglitly laced, and :
