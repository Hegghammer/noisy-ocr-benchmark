and genealogy of the early settlers of Southold—examining all the deeds and zwi/ls,
and other authentic documents to be found, and also copying the inscriptions from
every headstone, not only in Southold, but over nearly the whole Island—makes it
very evident that some of those named were not there at so early a date, and he
also says that Pefer Hallock, who is named as one of the thirteen, was the grandson ny
of the Puritan Hallock who settled at Southold, and whose Christian name avas
William. Mr. Moore is one of the best genealogists of the coygtry, and i eit
to Long Island, he is the best authority extant.

—O MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE.

It will be seen by the engraving that the old house is double. ‘The
western part is that which was built by Barnabas in 1659-60. The
east or two-story part was built by Jonathan I., about 1682, The upper
room of this part was used for a court-house for nearly twenty years,
as we learn from Thompson’s History of Long Island, and some of

Rented benches used when it was a court-house are still preserved.
The old ‘‘castle,’’ as Jonathan G. Horton, its last Horton occupant,
used to call it, is in all probability the oldest wood house in America.
I know of no dwelling-house of any kind, stone or brick, now stand-
ing, that can date back as far as this venerable old mansion. There
were a few huts on the east of Long Island previous to 1640—two or
three it is said on Shelter Island. But these, as well as those built by
the Puritans, JparcdpLh_ on Aci eA lope’ ir iontbpld-woon all
passed away. Noi a vesiige of any of the first generation buildings
can be found except this one, it remained for the house that Barnabas
-built to survive the wreck of ages, and to stand to-day as a noble >
representative of the dwellings of two hundred and fifteen years ago.
But theeottt IME siands to-day not only as peering above all others
by its age, but also by its occupancy. It is not very often that we find
two generations o! the same name, living and dying in the same house
rarely find three. But here we have six generations in succession/a
bearing the Horton name, living and dying in the same house a
all born in it except Barnabas I., and his son Jonathan. We nlay /

With a few repairs, the old castle may yet stan’ generations far
in the future. :

It requires some thought and reflection to realize the lapse of time
since the old house was built. Ses.the old Puritan himself there

Be Jr., about sixty years; and next Lawrence and Ags son Jona-
