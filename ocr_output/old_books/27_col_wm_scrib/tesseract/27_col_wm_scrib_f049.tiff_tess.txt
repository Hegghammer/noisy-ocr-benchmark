ROBIN HOOD Bt
goes to Nottingham town, to repair the omission.
He especially venerated the Virgin, and is in any
one ballad found to be so extremely devoted. to
his religious duties as to have three mass ;
before dinner.
At the same time, although he is found de-
claring to his band that no damage is to be
done to any husbandman “that tylleth with lis
plough,” nor to any good yeoman, nor to any
knight or squire “that wolde be a good felowe,”
he delights in persecuting ecclesiastical dignitaries.
A fat abbot, or a steward of a monastery, unlucky
noe ettorigh to fall in with him, has a weary time of
it. The higher these personages, the worse the
treatment meted out to them. “ Ye shall then (/-
beat and bind,” we find Robin directing his merry
men; and as these ballads were but the essence
of the public fecling of the age, it is quite
evident tht’ Whett i a0 Sarpy the Meher made
away with the monasteries, he must have had a
very considerable and long-established force of
popular sentiment entirely in accord with him.
~One of the chief exploits of Robin with the
dignified clergy was the traditional meeting with
the Bishop of Hereford, in Skelbrooke Pgh,
where he was said to have made the Bih¢p
dance round an oak, and then, afjee plunderi /
— — him, to have left him bound an to the -
tree. Variations of the story ave sMet with in
plenty in legends of other outlaws and highway-
men.
