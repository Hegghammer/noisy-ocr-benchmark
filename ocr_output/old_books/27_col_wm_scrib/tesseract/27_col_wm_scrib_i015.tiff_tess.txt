Remember that they know not what eo
o strike in deadly fear and ghastly hate;
emember that somehow, and at some time,

Each crime exacts its human penalty.
Remember that man’s conscience and man’s mind
Are agents of Thy purpose and Thy pian,

neon ac work within a deadlier revenge
Than any shrapnel shot or sabre thrust. (/-
Remember that new generations come
Upon whom fall the burden anc the curse,
The anguish o* old hatreds and past wrongs,
The crushing “sbi, he truggle and despair.

T Restrain, O God, the sweep of this vast hate;
Recall the nations to their sense of shame:
To those in blinding war, to us at peace,
Reveal anew the message of the Christ.
