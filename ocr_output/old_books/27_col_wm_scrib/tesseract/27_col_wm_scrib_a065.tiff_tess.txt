Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, inJluence ay
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have algo wtrkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provine A urkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this er-added evil, is, the
la eigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, greater marauders and

fe tors than the Turks, the regular occupation of whose lives comprises
murdeyand robbery, and who have through weary centuries \unremittingly
uary#ed themselves upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits of their labour and toil. Indeed as the Hamidich cavalry which
was established expressly for the Hamidian massacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized murder, can now find for those habits in
which they were encouraged and trained to indulge by the Hamidiaa
mon Renn

Under all such conditions no hope of better days can be forthcoming,
no prospect of better times seems possible, for that unhappy portion of th
Armenian race whom force of circumstances keeps on the soil of th
fatherland.

The appointment of Christian governors over the provinces in-
habited by them might ameliorate some of the evils, or the other alternative,
of allowing the use of arms. to. all alike ipsesReas of creed or
nationality, would “furmish Some ans “or Selfdefencé” against the raids
and barbarities of the oppressors; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christian peasant subject to Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his enemies, must remain one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Notthe most fertile
soil, not t?™ most iavourable climatic conditions, not the most assiduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, can bring to the
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
happiness, and security of life and property, which the law of iviized
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer and tiller of the/sof. TS
