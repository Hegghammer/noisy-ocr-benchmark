DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE. any
Ihave thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from acdéo
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested wfpngss
“Weare having a perfeetly hideous time here. Thousands hgeheen murdered—25 000
in this provinee they say ; but the number is probably greater, fo8 every Christian village
wasygffped out In Adana about 5000 have perished. After Turks and Armenians |ad
ng the Turks came in the night with hose and kerosene, and set fire to what renoined
ol ghian quarter, Next day the French and Armenian schools were fired. Nearly evory-
o YArmenian school perished, anybody trying to escape being shot down hy thesaldiers.”
he Turkish Authorities do nothing except arrest unoffending Armenians, from whont
by torture they extort the most fanciful confessions. yen the wounded are not safe from
their injustice. .A man was being carried in to me yesterday when lie was seized and taken
off to gaol. I dare not think what his fate may be.
“For fiends inearnate commend me to the Turks. Nobody is safe from them. They
murder babies in front of their mothers ; they half murder men, and yielate the wives while
the husbands are lying there dying in pools of blood.”
nes did nothing, and the soldiers were worse than the crowd, for they were
better armed. One house in our quarter was burned with 115 peopic inside. We counted
the bodies. ‘he soldiers set fire to the door, and as the windows had iron bars, nobody
could get out, Everybody in the house was roasted alive. They were all women and
children and old people.”—Extraet from letter of Mrs, Doughty-Wylie, wife of British Consul
| at Adana ; published in the London “ Daily ail.”

IN THIS HOUSE 115 WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ROASTED ALIVE.
llistory repeats itself. In 1895 Turkish soldiers fell upon seventy to eighty young
women and girls in a church, where they had fled for refuge, and after hidcously outraging
them, barricaded them in, setting fire to the byameenbepatvr gad derisively shouting
to AW they were being roasted alive, to call upon their Christ to save them now
