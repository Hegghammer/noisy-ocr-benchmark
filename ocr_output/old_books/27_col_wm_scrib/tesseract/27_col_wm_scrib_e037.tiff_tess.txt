THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE. 29
Oriental figure of speech, is said to have been ‘ravished by the 4c aT
of her sandals.’ Like the belles of Egypt she did ng) disdajns“rf setiing
off her charms, to have recourse to perfumes cosmetics, and
tously to setting out she ‘anointed herself with precious ointment.’ |
anther place Jezebel is said to ‘paint her eyelids ;? and Solomen, in
the Proverbs, in describing the deceitful woman, adjures his son not to |
taken with her eyelids,’ evidently alluding to the use of co!lyiium.
The Jewish beauty owed no slight obligation to her luxuriant tresses,
which were decorated with waving plumes and strings of pearls; and
in allusion to this custom, followed among the tribes from time imme-
morial, St. Paul affirms that ‘a woman’s ornament is her hair? Judith
ided tte hair of her head and pnt a tire upon it;? and the headdress
of Pharaoh’s daughter, in the Canticles, is compared by Solomon to
Carmel. No mention is made of jucith’s mirror, but it was undoubtedly
made of brass, like those described in Exodus xxxviii. 8 as ‘the
looking-glasses of the women which assembled at the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation.’ ”
