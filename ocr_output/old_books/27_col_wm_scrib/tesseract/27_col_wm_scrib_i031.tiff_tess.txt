THE LUSITANIA’S LAST VOYAGE
I mean those in the staterooms. I cannot Torgt
speak with certainty in regard to the port-
holes on deck E. I believe that ae
the ship took brought her down to these
@ open ports on the starboard side and that
she sank much more quickly from filling
through them.
On my return to the deck 7 felt that the
neu steamer must make her final plunge any mo-
ment now, and as there was nothing morethat -
could be done on the port side—{or there was (/-
| no discipline or order with which to do it—I
passed through to ihe starboard side. Men
were Stving Yo low-r the boats and were
T putting women and children into them, but it
seemed t to me that it only added horror to
the whole situation to put people into a
boat that you knew never would be cleare
and which would go down with the sea)
better leave them on the deck te let the: TS /
——  — take their chance at a piece of esase "
