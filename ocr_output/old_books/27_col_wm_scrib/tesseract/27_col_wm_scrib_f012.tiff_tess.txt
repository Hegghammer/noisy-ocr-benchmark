viii PREFACE
from Sinith, who himself was prone to include
* the most extravagant myths in his pages, calls any
his folio A GepNERAL AND TRUE History<
THE Lives aNpD Acrions OF THE "AMOUS
HienwayMen. Both of them inclitde pirates and
murderers. Of the “truth” of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better. j
No one has ever reprinted those authors in
their original extravagance, or their grossivess.
It would be impossible ; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
them, or even written an independent history of
the highwaymen. When we consider how astonish- (/-
ingly popular those romances have ever been
| which have had Cloude Du Vall, and Turpin,
and their like sor hevogs, ths Is not little
surprising.
¢ / Perhaps the task has been abandoned because
of the difficulty—ike almost insuperable difficulty
=O Tiny fuct from fiction, and because of «
chilling sense that it would be a thankless task
to present the highwayman as he really wasf Ja
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed dn
cruel, and often cowardly. NorBavelist would /
— — be likely to thank the frank senor this dis-
service ; and I do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgerp_arauds_tbe-widely read.
