32 HALFHOURS WITH THE HIGHWAYMEN
romantic souls to take to the woodlands and be
also Robin Hoods, in admiring imitation, seems any
sufficiently evident from old records, of whic
the Derbyshire petition to Parliaffent—} 39
is typical. The petitioners solicit elp to pro-

others who, it is stated, ‘‘ wente into the wodes
like as it hadde be Robyn-hode and his meyne.”
Nottingham was ever a town inimical to our
Robin ; probably because it was nearest to his
haunts in Sherwood Forest. In the carliest ballad
extant of his exploits, we learn how, going piously
nner the town for the feast of Pentecost, he met
an old monk whom he had once robbed of £100.
The monk “betrays” him, and to prevent his ;
escape the town gafes are closed. Robin, seeking
to leave, is captured, after a desperate resistance,
and thrown into prison; and_ the _false-hearted
news to the King, who will be delighted to learn
that the bold outlaw is at last laid by the heels.
_ But Little John and Much waylay the monk,
and kill him and his little page, and themselves,
with the despatches, seek audience of the King,
who sends a command by them to the Sheriff gf
Nottingham, ordering him to bring Robin d
before him. /
