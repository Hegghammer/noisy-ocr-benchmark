THE LUSITANIA’S LAST VOYAGE
Friday noon (May 7) we made only 462 miles. oy
This was partly accounted for by the fact,th
we picked up Greenwich time ape Clear
and put the clock ahead 1 hour and 40
O minutes.
The reason this small run impressed itsc!f
upon my mind was that I expecte? that
when we sighted the Irish Coast the “Lucy”
none r-would show a burst of “top specd” and that
we should go flying up at not less than 25 (/
miles an hour. The rup up ‘o Thursday noon
| (May 6) had been 484 miles, and so confident
was J that -he vould put gn, steamy that I
bought the bigh number in the pool (for
T Friday), which was 499. It was the only pool
Lvent-into and I couldn’t help it, for the
number sold at £3.0.0 and at that price it
looked like a “‘bargain.”
During the forenoon of Thursday coe TS /
