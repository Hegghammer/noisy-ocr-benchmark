‘Church, but was also a fearless patriot—a distinguished linguist, an eloquent preacher, snd, any
thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded betyeen Tu
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it pray Aho, in
spite of the feared fanatieal uprising of the Turks, threw pradfflegt Tnds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian hy,

Atthe first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish deléSates were thuuderstruck to

Tey rom official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinople, cnt
fr Moushgneur Nereés, the Patriarch, their object heing to request the signatory Powers ot
he Berlif Treaty to foree a guarantee from the Turkish Government to make cortain
nportysft improvements in Armenia,

Abdul Hamid and his advisers were furious at this affront, and Monseigneur Nereés was
summoned to the Palace. It is said that when he received the summons he simply smiled
and asked one of of his curates to read the Burial Service to him, as he did not expect to
return alive. However, he went. No one has ever heard what passe between the Sultan
and himself’ at the interview ; suffice it to say that he immediately summoned the Armenian
General Assembly and tendered his resignation, This was not aecepiod by the Assembly,
and, amidst enthusiastie cheers, he was carried hack to his apartments at the Patriarchate.

FOV Portinptory order reached him, signed hy the Sultan, to reeall the Armenian
delegation from Berlin. This Monseignear Varjabétian point-blank refised to do, and retived
to his private residence at Haskeuy, « village on the Golden Horn. ‘The success of the dele-
gation, howeyer, did not come up to his expeetations. The Armenians, as it happened, could
not be heard, but they were so far successful 2s to have an article inserted in the treaty.

The Sultan and his advisers never forgaye the Patwiareh this, though they could not
openly do anything to him on account of his enormous popularity, ‘Time passed on, and to
all appearance the incident was forgotten, but it was not so. One summer afternoon a most
cordial invitation was sent by a very high dignitary of the Palace, requesting the Arehbishop
to dine with him informe tak nn Lend Doe refused, so ed
the Archbishop, accompanied only by a body-servant named Vartan, repaired to the Pasha’s ™
house. The Pasha received hiin at the door aud escorted the visitor with much ceremony and
extreme courtesy to a private apartment of the salamlik of his house (the men’s quarters),
where dimer was served. The geniality displayed hy his host dispelled any fears that the
Archbishop might have had as to his personal safety.

After dijcacaet comet, coiiic was served. Now, this serving of the coffee is rather a
ceremonial according to high Turkish etiquette, and it is not unusal for guests to bring their
own (chooboukdas (the scryant who carries his master’s pipe and pouch and also superintends
the making of his coftee). The Archbishop was presented with a “ tchoobouk ” (pipe) filled
and lighted for smoking, and a servant followed with coflve. The Archbishop agépted froth
with due compliments to his host, and took a sip at his coffee. Just at thafimgmcrf the

servant Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, in a yoice trembling with emotion, F MpyAg Gu,

—— This was enough for the Arehbishop ; he pretended to hoftfTey and spilt the coffee, but, -
alte had already drank a small quantity of it. Meanwifile a softille was goiug on behind
the portitve, where his poor servant Vartan was paying thd peypAty of his devotion to his
master. Concerning Vartan’s whereabouts or his ultimate end nothing was ever made public
—the poor fellow simply vanished. Monseigneur Vayjabétian, after a short interval thanked
the Pusha for his generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily sammoned. The Patriarch took to his hed,
