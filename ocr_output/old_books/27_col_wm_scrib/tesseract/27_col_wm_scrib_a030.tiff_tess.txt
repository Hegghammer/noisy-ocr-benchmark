The efforts of the Armenians, and the entreaties of their P. mar
Nerses had procured the insertion of Article 16 in the¢’ fy of San
Stefano signed between Russia and Turkey in wetTV1S78. In fact the
wording of the Article had been suggested by<{he Patriarch himself. It

ided the following stipulation for the protection of the Armenians :—~

‘As the evacuation by the Russian troops of the territory which they
now/occupy in Armenia, and which is to be restored to Turkey, might give
ig to conflicts and complications detrimental to the maintenance o! good
relations between the two countries, the Sublime Poric cngages to carry into
effect without further delay the improvements and reforms demanded by
local requirements in the provinces inhabited by the Armenians, and to
guarantee their security against the Kurds and Circassians.”

What followed has passed into history. ‘The British Government of

ret Ter] Beaconsfield (then Mr. D’Isracli) was ’remier, and Lord Salis-
bury Foreign Secretary, once more pursued the old policy of baffling Russian
aggrandizement in Turkey. Afraid that her own real or fancied interdst
would thereby become imperilled, /:ngland threw in the weight of her powey,
and virtually commanded the substitution of the Treaty of Berlin in lieu Of
the Treaty of San Stefano. Thus the substantial guarantee of a natural and
immediate protector, both able and desirous of enforcing the protection which
the Armeniang then had in Busca was taken away, and the security of im-
potent words giveirtn its stead, Namely —

“The Sublime Porte undertakes to carry out without further delay the
improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces
inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the
Circassiangpadteurds. It will periodically make known the steps taken to
this effect to the Powers, who will superintend their application.”

“Tt will periodically make know the steps taken to this effect to the
fowers, who will superintend their application.” How this Jgst proviso
could furnish food for laughter were it not for the terrible tragedy ipivolved
in it.

‘The insertion of Article 61 in the Treaty o rlin, granté&% or rath /

— seemingly granted, by the six Powers of Eur ved in reality, as s -
—TNuent events bore out, an instrument of defth ayfl torture, It was as if
the reversal of the figures had reversed thi Ssibilities of succour and
protection, and with the death of the Czar Liberator, the last chance of the
Armenians died.
