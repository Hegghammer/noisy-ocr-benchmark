ores pages I have directed my humble etiorts to sketch out
what the Powers of Europe have done in the past, and how their actions
have reflected on my unfortunate race.

It is considered good policy now by 2 certain class of European writdrs
to ascribe all the horrors of the Armenian Massacres to Hamid the desp:

| to represent him as a tyrant as unassailable and unconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as a sort of superhuman being who swept everything
before him to the consummation of his own despotic will. The reason for
this is not difficht parr ha Netti kniteatowNe part Europe
has played in the tragedy, and to do this successfully it becomes necessary
also to present Turkey to the world now as a paradise (from whence the
tyrant once removed) peopled only by saints and angels ; so we have also
many roseate colored word pictures of Constitutional Turkey.

Thetmrdérs, deportations and imprisonments of the Turkish revolu-
tionaries, or more correctly reformers, were undoubtedly the sole work of
Abdul Hamid and his palace clique, but Abdul and his minions could not
have carried out that hellish work of wholesale extermingfifn pf the
Armenians without the perpetration and participation of te Jurki
people. It is true the massacres were originated and onganfzcA pt the
Palace, the Palace clique stirred up religious fangeetsm and race Matred, b /

— the co-operation of the people was necessary (2: people co-operat -
in order to plunder and enrich themselves with the Yorldly goods that the
Armenians always knew how to acquire by theif orn industry and toil; the
appeal to their marauding and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten tq one and who sxere practically unarmed.
