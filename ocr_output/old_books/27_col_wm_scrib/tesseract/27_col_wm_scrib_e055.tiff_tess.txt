THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE. 49
having only her kirtle upon her back. John ser?
wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus dygcribes any ‘of
ladies. They were, says he, “clothed all alike, in ith rich capes
ox_mantles, parti-coloured, white, and blue, embroMered all over witii
meus devices.” Their bodies are described as being ‘ong and small,
and Jhey had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though cach of them
been a queen. We find that the tight-laced young ladies of the
court of the Lady Triamore “had mantles Of green-coloured velvet, | :
handsomely bordered with gold, and Jined with rich furs, ‘their heads |
were neatly attired in kerchiefs, and were ornamented with cut work and
richly-striped wires of gold, and upon their kerchicfs they had. each of
tty coronal, embellished with sixty gems or more ;” and of
their pretty mistress it is said in the same poem, that her cheeks were as
red as the rose when it first blossoms, er hair shone upon her head
like golden wire, falling bencath 2 crown of gold richly ornamented with
| precious stones. Her yesture was purp/e, and her mantle, lined with white
ermine, was also elegautly furred with the same. The Princess Blanche,
the daughter pLRdpea Hh aha suhiere of the -anpesed_llustration,
appears to have copied closely the dress above described, and, like the
maids of honour of the Lady Triamore herself, she is not only richly
habited but thoroughly well-laced as well. Thus we see, in the year
130%, the fyllinfience of the corset on the costume of that period. i
There is another poem, said to be more ancient than even Launfal,
which, no doubt, served to give a tone and direction to the fashicns of
times following after. Here we find a beautiful lady desgtbhd 4s
wearing a splendid girdle of beatén gold, embellished with yibigs ghd
emeralds, about her middle small. /
__I Gower, too, when describing a lover who G act of admiring -
Tis mistress, thus writes:— —--
* He seeth hir shape forthwith, all |
Hir bodye round, hir middle small.” Af
