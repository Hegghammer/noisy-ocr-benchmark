The feaaer ‘Willysee ata glance the plan of this book. We com-
mence with the Christian name, Then follows the parentage, genea-
logical data, &c., and then the Christian names of the children and
order of births. In many of the early families the exact order
births cannot be ascertained; but it has been approximated as neqftly TS
as possible. The lineage is given in connection with the first member /
—__ of the family. The Roman numerals indicate O of births. .
“~The sons and daughters of the old Puritan, Barnfhas, cgnstitute the
second generation, but they are spoken by way of eteénce as Joseph
I., Hannah I., &c. The book contains much repetition, but none
too much to make it plain and easy to study.
This little book contains the chrgpisles of oply abouts one-half of
the Horton families looked up. Those whose genealogical data are
gi only in a small part, and those whose correct lineage has not
n satisfactorily ascertained, are not included in this book.
