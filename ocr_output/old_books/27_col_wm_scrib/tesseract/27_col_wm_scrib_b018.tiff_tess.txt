held in a state of tranquillity. . Here, too, is not much Expr®sion, but an extraordinary grandeur
of Character, suited to the greatness of an occasion where the Deity himself especially interferes
O to seal up the voracious energies of the most terrible of his creatures, in calm submission. There
is a character of royal dignity mingled with this submission, which is very impressive, and even
sublime.
The writer esteems this to be a successful restoration of the Nature that was wanting in the
prints of this subject, (which has often been engraved by Picaxr and others,) after RuBENs. The
original picture it has been our ill-fortune never to have seen. The shargy manes, and the latent
terror that sits gloomily enthroned in the open eyes of the superior Lion—suited to the darkness of
the den, and the nature of this animal’s sense of vision,—are as well thought of, as they are

of which also the character is most happily marked. A powerful and divine spell possesses
them both.
