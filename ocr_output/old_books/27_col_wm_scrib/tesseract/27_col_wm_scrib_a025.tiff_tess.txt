Further in answer to Ahmed Riza Bey’s account of the, Armee ae
“prétendus patriotards ”’ in connection with the Ottoman Bane; hnot do
better than quote from Mr. Bryce’s version of the AIM the massacre
that followed: ‘In the following June serious trouk arose at Van, where
s ort of insurrection is said to have been planned, though in the discre-
A, the accounts it is hard to arrive at the truth. Masses of ‘Kurds
came dpwn threatening to massacre the Christians, and a conilict in which
anyAnnocent persons perished, was with difficulty brought to an end by
the intervention of the British Consul. A little later the Armenian revolu-
tionary party, emboldened by the rising in Crete, where the Christians, being
well armed and outnumbering the Muslims, held their ground successfully,
issued appeals to the Embassies and to the Turkish Government to introduce
reforms, threatening disturbances if the policy of repression and massacre

ro pstited in. These threats were repeated in August, and ultimately,
on August 26, a band of about twenty Armenians, belonging the revolutionary
party, made a sudden attack on the Imperial Ottoman Bank in Constan
tinopie, declaring they were prepared to hold it and blow it up should it /
Sultan refuse their demand. ‘They captured the building by a coup de mazn,
but were persuaded by the Russian dragoman to withdraw upon a promise
of safety. Meanwhile the Government, who through their spies knew of the
project, had organised and armed a large mob of Kurds and Lazes—many
of whom had recenet\ beans iere therein the lowest
Turkish class. Using the occasion, they launched this mob upon the peace-
ful Armenian population. The onslaught began in various parts of the city so
soon after the attack on the Bank that it had obviously been prearranged,
and the precaution had been taken to employ the Turkish rufhans in different
quarters itemetheseta which they dwelt; so that they might less easily be
recognised. Carts had moreover been prepared in which to carry off the
dead. For two days an indiscriminate slaughter went on, in which not only
Armenian merchants and traders of the cultivated class, not only be indus-
trious and peaceable Armenians of the humbler class, clerks, ie -
yants, porters employed on the quays and in the warehouses, buf alfo Yoy
and children were butchered in the streets and huntggdown all th NE /
suburbs. On the afternoon of the 27th the Britisf Vite d’ Affaires (whose -
fetion throughout won general approval) told (the Sgltan he would land
British sailors, and the Ambassadors telegraphed re Sultan. Then the
general massacre was stopped, though sporadic slaughter went on round the
city during the next few days. The Ambassadors, who did not hesitate
to declare that the massacre had been organised by the Government,
