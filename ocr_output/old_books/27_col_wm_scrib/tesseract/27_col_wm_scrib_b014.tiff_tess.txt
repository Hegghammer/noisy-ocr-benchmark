2 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. ay
the scene of which, by the way, he has not represented as a royal menagerie, but ild,

rocky envern—his animals partake of the artificial character gf which we fring ourselves to

approve.

Of this fact, however, we purpose to exhibit proof witfSqur assertion. Improved versions, to
the best abilities of our Artists, of some of these Lions of RupEns and the Assyrian king, will here
be introduced, which the reader, who pleases, may compare with the originals. Our second, third,
and fourth Plates are of the number.

The Lions of Rubens are humanized. We do not intend to discuss at length whether the
ideality of allegorical painting required this: we only state the fact: yet the opinions which we
felt at liberty to form on the subject, we feel at liberty to utter. So much in apology for using the
licence of asserting that the heads of many of the Lions of Rusnns rather resemble those of frowning
old gentlemen decorated with Ramillies wigs ; as if Nature’s journeymen had made manes, and not
made them well. There is a profusion of flowing and curling haiv, which seems rather to solicit

PW romMetiguents of the perfumer, than to have endured the torrid heats of the desert, or the rough
storms of the forest. he shag of a Lion’s mane isa very dillerent sort of thing.

However such dressed Lions may be thought to accord with Allegory, they are demonstfab!
at variance with Nature. To be sure, what might become a Lion in the procession of the Caigal
Virtues, might be rather unsuitable in Iris den, or within the precincts of those wild haunts, wher® he
js accustomed to roam in his uaturg] state. We haye often read of the fabled Men-bulls, or (Mino-
taurs,) and we find such on the coinage of Crete. These allegorical creatures of RuBxENs, which,
alas ! have, somtimes Tyegn grin by. Arpe's yn. half bs geujus,and placed in savage con-
flicts, or beside their Britsanias—are a species of Men-lions. Placed among the Sabean sculp-
tures, they might pass for incarnations of Sol in Leo ; but would very ill pass for Leo alone.

Among the observers of this poetic improvement, or this natural and unpoetical deficiency, on
the part of Rubens, Prrtan, JuLio Romano, and other painters, both ancient and modern; and
of the cousggysit desiderainm on the part of the public, of a cabinet or library collection of the
iobler ¥ ‘id animals ina state of Nature, so as to auswer the purposes of reference, while they con-
duced to the pleasures of Taste, were Mr. Epcar Spitspury and Mr. Tuomas Lanpsrer.
‘Whether or not the publie “looked up to them for light” on that subject, (to ugasthe Ignguage of
