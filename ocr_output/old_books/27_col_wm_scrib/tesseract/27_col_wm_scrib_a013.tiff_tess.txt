WHY AND ange
( In Yen a study of my race, I have found three marked characteristics
Inte#ifence—Energy—Industry. Combined with these three characteristics
is an intense Love of Nationality. We live in a complex world. In an
independent people these characteristics and this sentiment are laudable
Virtues. In a subject people they are Crimes.
After Lhad laid this bitter Truth to heart, I did not have to seek for the
ONT therefore of the Armenian Massacres.
The Armenian Massacres stand without their parallel in history. The
human mind staggers to contemplate the fiendish orgies of which they have
been the victims, and no pen can deseribe their horrors: and this helpless
christian people are to-day in the same deadly peril as they have been since
the famous Treaty of Berlin consigned them bound hand and foot to the
mercy of their exeeOTO0st NNN Ne

work of extermination may be completed—Jesus Christ was crucified on
Calvary and the servant is not greater than his Lord—but the work of their
exterminatiogseen omkr be completed when the evil influences in the Turkish
Empire have reached their culminating point. Hitherto the Powers of
Europe have by their jealousies and rivalries cultivated these evil inflpences,
they have watered them and made them grow, but when their ofnfnayng
point is reached, they must re-act on Christendom and the /n
consequence must follow. Those who sow the wit nust reap thwhirl- /

1 will allow that Liberty, Justice, Equality, Fratkrnity/are the watchwords
of Young Turkey, but Young Turkey is only a small minority; the great
majority of the Turkish nation are not Young Turks.
The question therefore resolves itselfinto this cpitical point: “What will
Vt even now?”
