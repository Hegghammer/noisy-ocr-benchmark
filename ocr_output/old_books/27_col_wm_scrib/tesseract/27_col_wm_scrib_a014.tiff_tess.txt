Aloxan®tta district destroyed with immense loss of life. Hadjim, Kessab and the neigh-
houring villages were burned. ‘The Armenian quarter in Tarsus was ruined and ill-omened
Marash stained again with the blood of thousands of Armenians, Zeitoon was desolated. The
entire population of Kirikon between Aleppo and Alexandretta were masgagred yto the last

homes, and the residue of those who eseaped massacre reduced to Mefhelessness fad /
