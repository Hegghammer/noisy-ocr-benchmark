the evolution of all history. But that of the
highwaymen begins with the giants and the any
heroes, continued down through the legendar
period of Robin Hood, to the timeg af Ivil
War in England, between King Garles and his
Parliament, when highway robbers cloaked their
villainies with Royalist partisanship, to the less
romantic eighteenth century, and finally ended,
early in the nineteenth century, with al! the
glamour and tinselled things of the past, in squalid,
commonplace circumstances. The highwaymen
begin in the dimness of antiquity, continue very

wen egely as heroic myths throughout the middle
ages, become philanthropic and chivalric figures
in succeeding eras, and later are seen to be mere
masquerading footmen, brave only in their masters’
fine clothes, seeking money wherewith to gamble
and to live dissolute lives. They end, sordid,
mud-splaoned fyares from which romance shrinks;
in no detail distinguishable from such vermin as
the footpads, who on dark nights robbed women
and _chijdven, and defenceless old men, for coppers
in solitary lanes, and fled in terror from the
robust.
