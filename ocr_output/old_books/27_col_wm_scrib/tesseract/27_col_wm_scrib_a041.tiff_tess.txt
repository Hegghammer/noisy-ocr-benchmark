like a round bow, a great brown cye revealed the inward spirit’s intelligence,and zy

Thus, near the end of last December, one of a centuff spur est_ men—M erditch
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of Xf Armenian people -slowly
approgching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Ktchntzin, or “ The Ouly- begotten
Descended.” From the window of a neighboring room he might have looked across the

1; hnd plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now all cut close and buried for the
winter. J Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling snow and uricane that hid the
cone YaArarat. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
. of that lake, eighty-seven years ago, Klvimian was born, Tn 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land; the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byron sct out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom—a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Near Last. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos now looked back, but uot unhappy, for
from first to last it had been inspired by one absorbing and unselfish aim—the freedom and

ro remprmmnbhis people. It is trac he had failed.

From his earliest years, when he had witnessed the terrors of turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality—such po
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance among tlle
prosperous and contented of the world. He began as 4 poet, wandering far and wide throug
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jerusalem)
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his witc’s death, he devoted himself to the building of schools,
which he generously threw open to Kurds, the hereditary assassins of Armenians. For many
years, while Europe yasoceppigd with Cyime sn yars sivign Sears out ropch and German
wars, we see a A AN AIA ir RI Nt through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred cibiems of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenian patriarch of Constantinople (1869), he was driven from
his oflice after four years.

But th coupe obeeish iniquity was filling. The pitiless staughter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to plead! his people’s cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
spealcs no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great coyf9of Purope

pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London aNid sbAits of “ Peace with Honor,”
and Armenia was left to stew.

So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year Dyn Up ee EY) by the last incaleulabl
