CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. 3
2
Every artist does best, that which he is best qualified and best disposed to do. In com- ony
pleting the number of plates that has been found necessary for the Work, Mr. Epwin Ls Sp}
has chosen to proceed toward the same purpose, upon a different principl; e ‘ole, without
any introductory medium, directly to the living animals, and has exhibitegythe savage manners and
habi these quadrupeds, according to his own ideas and observations.
e distinction between Cuaracrer and Expression, we shall now deliver our opinion.
By the Cfaracter of an animal, we mean those permanencies of his look and features which he
lways piers to view when in a placid, or unimpassioned state: by his Expression, the variations
of muscular action superinduced on character, to which he is liable, as the storms of passion sweep
by, and his mind becomes agitated by external circumstances acting on the ardou’s of his instinct.
The former, seems to hold its court in the solid and massy parts: the leiter, agitates, oft-
times rebelliously, the nerves and muscles. Character is ever present, both in (lie animal coun-
tenance, and in the “human face divine.” ‘The most violent expression does not proscribe, or
oC Rta rctg. Individuality consists of it, as far as concerns external appearance ; and it
forms the system of vowels of the language of Nature, without which no Expression could be.
Whoever regards the faces of a flock of Sheep, will see ii tem on infinite variety of Character,
with very little Expression, and that little without diversity: and if we descend a step lower in
the scale of being, and contemplate the finny tribe, where Character is not wanting, we find no
Expression at all. Even Trees and inanimate objects, possess Character. We recollect a poetical
friend of ours, now in Italy, saying that every tree and eyery rock had a fuee—but of this we are
not so certain; though very certain, that there is enough of Character in rocks and trees, to make
a poet think so. OL LOD POO OOo OO
Character aud Expression, in the carnivorous class of animals, to which we here solicit
attention, are always co-existent — their proportions varying with the existing occasions —in
pictorial exhibitions of such subjects.

Tuene is tiuch Character, and little Expression, in the reposing Leopard with his sheathed
claws, which is shen in the present engraving, copied by Mr. Srrzspury from Riper, nd
corrected from Natuve. RrprxcEr was an artist of great power, who studied wild aginaf in
their sequestered haunts, as is shewn in his grand forest back-grounds; and who,{gen| ral)
speeking, left little or no room for others to improve, except on somgsfEy. of his inferior works. /
—! ‘Therpresent is an interesting and beautiful animal, yet there is flatent pability of mischief °
characterised in his countenance, and we might ask, in the languagy of Jy “ Who shall dare to
rouse him up 2?”
