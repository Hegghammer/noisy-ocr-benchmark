Primitive Methods.—Briefly the primitive process of convert:
ing the rattan, or raw material, into cane and reeds, or the finished =
product, is this: The rattan stems are thoraly dried or seasone oy
and the nodules are pared off with a peculiar native knifg. the
rattan is sorted into sizes and selection made e. The sort-
ing is based upon external color and diameteNof the rattan. The

tan is then immersed in water, and the stem is rubbed vigorously.
wyjth sand and cocoanut husks to remove dirt and foreign substances.

t is then bleached by means of sulphur fumes, either in the stem or
after the peel and core have been prepared.

The method of preparing the peel and core is this: The peel, or
outer covering, is removed with a heavy kaife; it is then stripped to
selected thicknesses and widths by drawing it by hand thru two

AON Veo set at: required distances apart. This peel is commercially
called cane. The core is then stripped into as many strands as
necessary, depending upon the diameter of the cores required.

| These are rounded by drawing them thru a sheet-of tin or iron
perforated with holes of different diameters. The rounded cores
are called reeds.

various sections of India, China, and the Philippines hand working
of rattan is a thriving industry; an industry seemingly peculiarly
adapted to the natives. The Philippine method of prepftihg the
