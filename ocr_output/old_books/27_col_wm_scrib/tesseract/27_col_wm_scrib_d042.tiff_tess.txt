her custom was, when she lay awake, amused herself

by building castles in the air. Sometimes she would ny

imagine herself as a great lady, sought after by

noble knights of the land, but holdin: oof with

reserved dignity until one, by so deed of vnusual

distinction, should win her favour. As a rule, however,

this seemed rather a dull part to play, though. there was

something naturally queenly in her nature, and she

would therefore prefer something more active, She

would take the old Seots romance of !iurd Helen, or

But at iast she fell into a sound slumber and did not

wake till it was nearly time for the morning meal.
