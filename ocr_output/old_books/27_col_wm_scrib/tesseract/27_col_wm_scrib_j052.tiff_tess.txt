48 SEAT WEAVING
Care must be exercised to keep the strands from overlapping im-
properly at the corners. The strands should fit snugly where they
go over the rails. ‘Io assure this, tap them sharply with a mallet oy
used over a block of soft wood. “This may be done gt nt
intervals or when several strands have been er each rail.

Uniform tension on the strand is desirable and this should be tight.
As the work progresses the interior between the upper and lower
rows of strands is stuffed. ‘This is done with the same mgf}ial Jas
that used in the weaving. The butt ends of rush are usfd fo gs
the seat of rush; raffia is used to stuff a raffigeseat; craft fer to /
— stuff a fiver seat; and soon. The packing s e done in a thoro -
manner, for it builds up the seat and prevekts iff breaking down at
the inner edges of the rails, and sagging with continued use. A
slightly curved hardwood stick about 12 in. long may be used to
advantage to do this work. Fig 4Lshows a,sketch of such a stick.
