XIV Preface.—Introduction.

This book is mainly what those who have kindly furnished records
and sketches have made it. The whole has been carefully compiled.
But genealogical works, almost of necessity, contain many errors ony
Doubtless this small work has its fullshare. But when errors =
covered, notice thereof should be given, so tit a s ition may
be made entirely truthful. Thankful to all wWeNave generously given
their assistance, this work is sent out as a sihall contribution to the
genealogical literature of the day, and in the hope that a more tull
and extensive book of Horton chronicles may be issued at no very
distant day.

Terrytown, ro Jan., 1876.
