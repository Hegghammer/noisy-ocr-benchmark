was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples whieh with sincere and deep frebaly any

Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the¥y mins who engage in
eomnerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruittQhess, increase the value of
the man Empire. Beeause a few among them justly started an agitation, these our noble
yf j trions brethren were being massacred. What a terrible scene! When
ftAhe school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our Armenian compatriots being
removed Yh manure carts ; legs and arms were hanging down outside. ‘This }loody scene will
Ker rg@ain impressed on my mind. .

“ This shocking crime of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this luke, during the
whole course of a cursed absolutism, up to the last moment, grew wider. Dyen during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feelings which had heen shown,
the awful events in Adana took place and the souls of all true Osmaulis melted into tears.
Up to the present time the deep sorrow caused by this event has not disappeared, beeause this
bloody wound in our social bady cannot easily be cured. While we iil! our stomachs with

ne rnpile we rest selfishly in our comfortable beds, these ftherless and brotherless
orphans, widows hungry, naked, and barefoot wander hither and thither, and thousands of
families are fleeing from the fatherland. We are convinced that the government is doing its
work, but what has happened is so great a calamity that it can keep a government busy for
years. However much sacrifice we may make, still it will be inadequate, becanse the
happiness of the fatherland depends on healing such blood wounds as these as soon as possible.
We are convinced that the government and all connected with it are persuaded of this as well as
ourselves. We must now wipe out the traces of the misfortune brought by a eursed period.
We must now comfort weeping hearts. We must understand aud teach those who do not
understand that patriotism and brotherhood d> not differ from cach other. _'The responsibility
of the government for MO NAHM MOEN OE ef OE ENT hole Ottoman
nation is under obligations to protect this suffering race, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
is in large part due to the blood shed by the Armenians. We thought that these truths
were so obvious that we preferred {o keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary from time to time to reeall the greatness of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yesterday has endured only barbarism, and for twelve years
has been CONS Waaabbys Compem™cd an ground to the earth, and has given thousands of victims.
Hereafter we must work to assure them that the era of massaeres has passed, and with all our
strength of mind and sou! we must quiet them. The obligation of the government to protect
them is also very heavy, hecause our Armenian countrymen live among wandering tribes.
We mst all assist the government and point out its obligation. It must by largd in
public and periodically that the one of the most important duties of the OttomyA nftionfis to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and pfopefty

whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim.”
his article of the Turkish officer, who howefer dgés not dare disclose
his identity ; and the account given by an author e Mr. James Bryce
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as “les Massacres occasionnés par les aventuriers Arméniens.”
