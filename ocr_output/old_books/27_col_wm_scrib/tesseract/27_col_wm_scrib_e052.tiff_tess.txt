The term kirtle, so often referred to, may not clearly convey to the
mind of the modern reader the nature of the garment indicated by it,
and therefore it may not be amiss to give Strutt’s description of it, He
says, “The kirtle, or, as it was anciently written ‘feric/, is a part of the

| garment sometimes called a “ surcol” Cheucer renders kirtle, and we
| have no reason to dispute his authority. Kirtles are very frequently,
