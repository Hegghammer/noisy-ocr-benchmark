No one doubts that a great forward movement is reaching its culming& ay
ing point in the destiny of Asia. “The West has learnt its all of refigs he
moral and guiding principle of mankind) from the EfJt the East
would fain learn the law of restraint and the law of eéedom (the protecting
pringiples of mankind) from the West. Inspired by this feeling the liberal
VYftledecidedly mean well, and they are animated with a sincere desire to

eace and security of life and property for the heterogencous peoples
ne Turkish sway, but they themselves have had to contend and sitll
ha&veto conteni! with a fanatical populace.

To the Mahommedan world at large the Caliph of Islam is the envoy of
God, the sacredness of whose person must be inviolate. Abdul Hamid, the
astute politician, knew that the security of his sovereignty depended on his
Caliphal rights, and his main policy during the long period of his execrable

A A plAResn directed towards preserving and asserting the same; thus
we can see how his dethronement, which the liberal Turks would gladly have
accomplished simultaneously with the inaucuration of the Constitution, had
to be deferred to a later period, and how it was necessary for the She k ul
Islam to pronounce the Caliph a traitor to his sacred trust, a violator of the
holy law of the Prophet, before his dethronement could be dared or
accomplished. 2

The Christian Armenians in SK live in the midst at the followers
of a hostile religion, wt no power or force behind thém which makes for
protection. Who does not know that the great numerical preponderance of
Hinduism keeps the balance of power in India, and restrains bloody religious

) cr hostilities; and when we review the whole religious history of Christian
Europe, and that terribly long roll of crimes committed in the name of Him
who expouted ITs religion with the parable of the Good Samaritan, and
the precept of loving one’s neighbour as one’s self, we cannot {eel surprise at
the fanatical outbursts of the followers of Mahommed, the founder qf a
religion whose doctrines certainly fall short of the humane fiynciples
“culcatcd by the Pounder of Christianity. If authentic historicalflacfs pfov
to us that horrible and atrocious cruelties have been perpetrated by C)As¢in /
nations, not only on other religionists, but on fello hristians of different
—— denominations, how then can we expect better th m the Turk unless -
some power or force restrain him ?

Christianity has now partly emancipated herself from the ferocities
which darkened and poured the red stream of blood on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at large, religion is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite. Moro
