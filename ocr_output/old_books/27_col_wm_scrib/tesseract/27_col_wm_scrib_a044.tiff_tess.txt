THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE ao
ARMENIAN PEOPI#)‘.
During a period extending over thirty years the civilize’ world has
of Turkish Massacres of Armenians. Massacres of a nature so
\ ferodous and diabolical, so hideous and revolting, that no pen could adequate-
ly déscribe their horrors
\ Writing in 1896, Mr. James Bryce, in his supplementary chapter to the
4th edition of his book ‘‘ Transcaucasia and Ararat’? makes the following
grave comment :—
“Twenty years isa short space in the life of a nation. But these
twenty years have been filled with sufferings for the Armenian Christians

have passed since the first Turkish Conquest of Armenia. They have been
years of misery, slaughter, martyrdom, agony, despair.”
And the years that have followed from 1896 to 1909 have had {h

of the most forlorn, but the country has not been wiped off the map. It still
occupies the veographical place it has held since history has bgen vwritten.
The land of the Euphrates and Tigris, that Araxes valley, whérd asfsimple
and primitive Armenians will to this day assert in unshaken bflieff G, CAS
nan in His own image, and the country round the base of AraratAvhére th /
generations of men once more began to people rth. .
— — Once the land of Ararat was an indepenflent kjhgdom until the tide of
victory rolled over it and conquered its indep e. Hemmed round by
three Great Empires, Russian, Turkish and Persian, the unfortunate geo-
graphical position of the country became the cause of its people’s ruin.
It is of bitter interest to Armenians to know that Ararat is the point
where the three Empires, RussietCewhist\andPersian, meet, whilst the
