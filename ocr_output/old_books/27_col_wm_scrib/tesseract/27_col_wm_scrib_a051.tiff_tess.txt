On the field the ever victorious army of little Japan undermined Jy Ss
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and evgp driyi K the ever
defeated and ever retreating army of colossal Rust tsea the ever
victorious Japanese Jleet succeeded in completely @nihilating the Russian
y It was war such as the world had never yet seen. The secret of
suéh as)ounding successes should be investigated, and here I beg leave to
quote from one of a series of articles in which I gave view to my opinions
wf the Russo-Japanese War. “ Japan may be likened to the bundle of
faggots in the fable firmly tied together ; one faggot of larger dimensions in
the centre, the sovereign round whom the whole nation clusters, and all,
ruler and people tied together by adamantine bands o! patriotism.”
These remarks of mine were based on observations of actual facts. In
national unity Japan stands as an object lesson to the world; she furnishes
reMirekaiiifesthich the world needs to copy, aiid which a nation so politically
forlorn as ourselves more than any other needs to copy.
From the astounding success of japan let us turn to the position th
Great Republic of the United States of America occupies in the world, and
take the lesson to heart of what Union can accomplish as we contrast their
present position with the position that the handful of puritan pilgrims occupied .
when they first landed on American soil not quite three hundred years ago.
National Usty(\enhratinat utr utiethic hetiehetich we must
raise up over our national life. National Unity must be engraven on the
tablets of our minds and throb in the pulses of our hearts. There are
mountains of difficulties belore us, and if ever we must reach the goal we
can only do so by being bound together like the bundle of faggots in the
fable, withese=\sert@nine or loosening of the bands. Then perhaps we
might once more be able to get an independent footing on the historical soil
of our fathers, and perliaps once more rally round our own flag. A Japan-
ese lives for the State, not for himself; we have no State for wlyjff) to Jive,
but let us live for our communities whilst we keep the hope ipfoyr hfarts
that communities grow into States.
\We have grit and endurance in an unpargtled degree, but these /
— characteristics will profit us nothing if we are wa fie unity. .
Let us remember that utterance of the Foukdes“of our faith. In our
loyalty and allegiance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents of a
cataract, but we must remember His warning utterance :—
“What shall it profit a man.” | \What shall itprofita nation. Unity is
ye Let us keep our soul and not lose tt.
