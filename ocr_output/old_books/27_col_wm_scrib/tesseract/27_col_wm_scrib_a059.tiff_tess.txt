A book has been written and published in Japan, its title © Niku Dan”
translated into English, reads, “Human Bullets.” This little book, a
narrative of the siege of Port Arthur, after being read through the length

Known of fanfuages ; and its young author, himself an actor in the siege,
was summoned to the presence of his sovereign to be thanked and praised.

is vividly portrayed the deadly struggle of the besiegers. It contains as an
acknowledgement of its merit, a page on which is recorded the Vield

With dying men and slain,
