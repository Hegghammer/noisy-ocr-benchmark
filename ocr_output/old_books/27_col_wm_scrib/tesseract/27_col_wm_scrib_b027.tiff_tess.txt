Iy this Group by Mr. Epwix Lanpseer there is much of violeySetfimal Expression, and
Charagtes fades before it, or rather, is absorbed in it. It tells a story of the past as well as the
p id is pregnant with a catastrophe not difficult to anticipate from the actions and
xpfessionsfof the parties engaged. A Fawn has been seized by a Liorarn, who has been
lespoiledf his prey by a more powerful Tiger. The Tiger in his.turn becomes the victim of an
enraged Lion. 7 2
The expression of the wounded Leopard is that of painful suffering mingled with dread.
Together, they amount to agony. Ie shrieks while he submits. The Jiger is still enraged and
resisting, though astounded with the power and suddenness of the Lion’s attack. Te is losing his .
energy of resistance, and is beginning to feel that all resistance is vain. He roars with anguish ;
while jis expression is that of terror, and indignation not yet subdued.
The Lion, who has just made his thundering spring, appears conscious of haying fatally seized
his adversary, and luxuriates fearlessly in his victory ; and with a powerful and just expression of
carnivorous enjoyment.—Meanwhile the characters of the animals, soyerally, are faithfully and
specifically represented.
Although our main purpose be to exhibit rather © pictorial than e physiological view of the
subject: having descanted on the word Character, we shall probably be expected to add, at least
a word or two, on the leading characteristics of the carnivorous class of quadrupeds.

language of the naturalists. Their heads are round; their visages short: they have six cutting
teeth, and two canine, in either jaw: their tongues are aculeated, the prickles inclining backward ;
their claws sharp, hooked, and retractile ; their cars small and acuminated; they have five toes on
"each of the fore-feet, and four only on those behind.
Of this gemenrof ‘Tits, we here exhibit the four principal species, Lions, Tigers, Leopards,
and Panthers, of which the Lion is justly placed at the head—at least, the unanimous voice of ages
has pronounced lim to be the king of beasts, and we have enthroned him accordingly in our Title-
page, (No. I.) Thoy form a tribe that is especially and properly Carnivorous, being thyoifly
class of quadrupeds that are exclusively flesh-caters.. Their jaws are very completely ayfied fior
this purpose ; their canine teeth being very long and angular, with the edges of the anglps tufne
toward the inside of their mouths ; so that when the.animal has caused ‘0 meet, or cross each /

them back without opening his mouth.
Their claws, and the formation of their feet, too, are eminently conducive to their predacious
