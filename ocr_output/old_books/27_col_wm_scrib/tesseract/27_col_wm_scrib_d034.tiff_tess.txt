you think, Aline?’’

Aline put her little white hand to chin and ‘cooked
down. ‘‘I do not know what to think about *,’’ she

to be treated fairly.’’

‘‘T hate unfairness,’’ said Audry in her impulsive way.

‘*T do not see why they should not he ailowed to speak
for themselves, and I do not see how people can condemn
them when they do not know whet their reasons are for

ween iking what they do. Of course | am very young and
do not know anything about it; but it sounds as though
the priests were e*raid that the truth can not take care
of itself; but surely it cannot be the truth if it is afraid
to hear the o*her side. I remember a motto on the chim-
ney piepe at Yoesar Nene veritas set at prevalebit,’
and it seems to me that it must be so. I wish that father
were alive io tal to me. He was so clever and he un-
derstood things.’”

“But-en have not said what your motto means,’’ Au-
dry interposed.

Aline laughed through the tears that were beginning
to gather,—‘‘Oh, that means, The truth is great ll
prevail. If it is the truth it must win; and it(c ;
no harm to have objections raised t it, as It will /

‘*What about the book, Aline?’’ Audry, changing
the subject; ‘‘no one is likely to come up here now, they
never do; so I think we could have another look at it.’’

OOOO
