as wretched as the Slavs or Cretans have been : and in so far worse off.
that in Europe there exists no large Lody of tribes making mander and
robbery its regular and daily occupation as the Kurds, and latterly the
Circassians also, have done in Armenia. If abyone will take the trouble to
read the complaints of oppressions and cruelties preseated to the Porte by
the Armenian Patriarchate ii) Siz (sicce reprinted in England) and some of
the more recent statements printed 1.3 the Armenians in England on the
same topic, he will see: that the stat of Turkish Asia presents as grave and
