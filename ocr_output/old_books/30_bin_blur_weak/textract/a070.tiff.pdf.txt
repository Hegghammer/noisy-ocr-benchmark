Ja the foregoing lages I have directed mit humble efforts I1) sketch out
what the lowers of Europe have done in the past, and how their actions
have realected on my unfortunate race.
It is considered goodi policy now br n certain class of European writers
to ascribe all the horrors of the Armenian Massacres to Hamid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as unassailable and nnconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as a sort of superhuman being who strept everything
before him to the consummation of his oun despotic will. The reason for
this is not difficult "1) perceive. They would fain disavow the part Europe
has played in the tragedy. and to do this successfully it becomes
necessary
also to present Tutkey to the world now as is paradise ifrom whence the
tyrant once removedi) peopled onis ii saints and angels SO we have also
many roscate colored word victures of Constitutional Turkey.
The marders. deportations and imprisonments of the Turkish nevolu-
tionaties, or more correctiy retormers, Werse. undoubtediy the sole work of
Abdui Hamid andi bis palace clique. but Abdul and his minions couid not
have carried out that hellish work of wholesale extermination of the
Armenians without the perperation and participation of the Turkish
people. It is tree the massacres were originated and organized hatred. in the but
Palace, the Palace lique stirred up religions fanaticism and race
the co-operation of the people was necessary and the people co-ouerated
in order to plunder and enrich thenselves with the woriély goods that the
Armenians always knew now to acutire is the ir own industry and toil ; the
appeal to their marauding and lestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was morcover casy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims lis alout ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
