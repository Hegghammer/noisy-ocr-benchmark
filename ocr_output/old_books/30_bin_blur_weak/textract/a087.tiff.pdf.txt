Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have clung 10 their christian faith through un.
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endare.
The cathedral of Etchmiatzin built by Gregory still stands today it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, until perhaps
little of the original building may be leít, but it still claims to be the church
built by the patron saint of Armenia. I shall here quote it passage from
"Historical Sketch of the. Armenian Church,' written by an Armenian
priest:
"Owing to political circumstances the Armenian l'atriarchate hadi at
times to be transferred to metropolises and to other principal towns of
Armenia. In the year A.D. 152 it was removed to Dwin, in 903 to Ani.
in 111.1 to Römklah, and in 1 29.1 to Sis. The Kingdorn of Cilicia becoming
extinct, and. me having no more it kingdom and no longer a capital town, it
was natural and proper to re-transfer the See to its our original place, as
the entire nation unanimously desired it. Accordingly. in the Year 1441 it
was decided by an coclestastical merting that the seal of the Catholicus should
return to Holy Exchmiatzin, where to this day has lien preserved the
proper unbroken succession from our Apostics and from ur holy Father,
St. Gregory the Illuminator."
I readi the other day in one of the foreign papers published in Japan,
the following piece of news:
'An Armenian Church procounced by experts todate from the second
century of the Christian (.1.2, has been discovero) in a fair state of presetva-
tion in the neighbout heod of Bash Aparnah.
Perbaps the excavations in Amenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light on Armenian bistory.
