No one joubts that a great forward movement is reaching its culminat-
ing point in the destiny of Asia. The West has learnt its all of religion (the
moral and guiding principle of mankind) from the East, and 11011 the East
would fain learn the l.ww of restraint and the law of freedom (the protecting
principles of mankind) from the West Inspired by this leeting the liberal
Turks decidedly mean well, and they are animated with a sincere desire to
ensure peace and security of life and property fo: the heterogeneous peoples
under the lurkish sway, but they themselves have had to contend and still
have to contend with a fanatical populace.
To the Mahommedan world at large the Caliph of 1-lam is the envoy of
God, the sacrediness of whose person most he: inviolate. Aidul Hamid, the
astute politician, knew that the security of his sovereignty depended on his
Caliphal rights, and his main policy during the long period of his execrable
reign had been directed towards preserving and asserting the same; thus
lie. can SEC how his dethronement, which the liberal Turks would glacily have
accompished simultaneously with the inauguration of the Constitution, had
to be deferred to a later period, and how !t was necessary for the Sle l: ul
Islam (1) pronounce the Caliph a traitor to bis sacted trust, a violator of the
holy law of the Prophet. before his dethronement could be dared or
accomplished.
The Christian Armenians in Turkey live in the midst of the follosers
of a hostile religion. with 110 power or force behind them which makes for
protection. 11 ho does not know that the great nomerica! preponderance of
Hinduism keeps the balance of power in India, anii restrains bloody religious
hostilities; and when "II." review the whole religious histery of Christian
Europe, and that ternibly long roll of crimes committed in the name of
who expounded 1 lis relicion with the parable of the Good Samaritan, and
the precept of loving ule's neighbour as one's seif, we cannot feel surprise ,II
the fanatical outborsts of the followers of Mahommed, the founder of
a
religion whose doctrines certainly fall short of the humane principles
inculcated by the Founder of Christianity. It authentic Listorical facts
prove
to
US
that horrible and atrocious cruelties have been perpetrated is Christian
nations, not only on other religionists, but on fellow Christians of different
denominations, how then can II'C expect better things from the Turk unless
some power or force restrain him ?
Christianity has 11011 partly emancipated herselt from the ferocities
which darkened and coured the red stream of blcod on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at large, religiou is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite.
