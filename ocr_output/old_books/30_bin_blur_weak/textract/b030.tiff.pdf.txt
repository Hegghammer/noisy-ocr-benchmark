CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
the position of the head. In all grammivorous animals, the skin of the head is closely attached to
the skull, and capable only of very limited motion : the eve is almost uniformly mild, and the lips
unmoyed by passion.
" It is in carnivorous animals, with "hose habits and manner of life, ferocity is instinctively
connected, as the great means of their subsistence, that rage is distinguished by the most
romarkable strength of expression. The eye-ball is terrible, and the retraction of the flesh of the
lips
indicates the most savage fury. But the first, is merely the exceted attention of the animal ;
and the other a preparatory exposure of the canine teeth. The great animals of prey-the Lion
and the Tiger-are quite incapable of any other expression of feature, than this particular display
of
ferociousness. When they fawn upon their heeper, there is no motion in their features that
indicates afféction."
In this assertion, that the countenances of the great animals of prey are incapable of any
other than ferocious expression, "Ir do not quite coincide with our learned physiologist. When
they fawn upon their keeper, iip think that indications of affection are exbibited; and find
ourselves ready to ask what else than kindly expression is that "licking of the hand" which our
author has before mentioned. If, however, we should grant that they may not be capable of
afféctionate expression toward their kreper, we can scarcely doubt hat-toward their young- if
II' could ob-reve them in their will state, and in their moments of playful intercourse and
enjoyment among each other-they are at least. we think there are motions in their features that
indicate affection, as well as fear, enquiry, surprise, gratitude, pleasurable wantonness, and some
other sentiments, or emotions. This is our conviction : at the same time, we perceive that the
rangre of their ferocions expression far records the savage circle of their domestic charities. Are
not even the least of these observable in the habits and manners of the domestic Cat, who belongs
to the Tiger genera : But "he have pien seen a Tiger in his den, who looked good-natured ehough
to be strohel and patted : aud of the Lion, of whom MR. GRIFTITH relates the following anecdote,
what can be said or thought ?
". Hearing some noise under his rage, the Lion passed his paw between the bars, and actually
hauled up his heeper who was cleaning beneath : but as soon as he perceived that be had thus ill
used his master, be instantly lay down upon his back in an attitude of complete submission."
Or what call be said of the circum-tance mentioned by SENECA (of which he was personally
witness), of a Lion. to whom a mam, who had formerly been his kceper, wasexposed for destruction
in the amphitheatre at Rome : and who was not only instantly recognised, but defended and
protected by the grateful beast :- - Or of the story related by DR. SOUTHEY, of the Lion who had
broken loose, submitting to the Cid, and allowing himself to be led back peaceably to his place of
confinement ?
Could any painter of talent proceed to represent either of these facts, without finding in the
