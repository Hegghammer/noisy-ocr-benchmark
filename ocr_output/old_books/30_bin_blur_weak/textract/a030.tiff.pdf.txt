The efforts of the Armenians, and the intreaties of thei: Patriarch
Nerses had procured the insertion of Article 16 in the Treaty of San
Stefano signed between Russia and Turkey in March In fact
the
wording of the Article had been suggested by the Patriarch himseit. It
provided the following stipulation for the protection of the Armenians :-
As the evacuation Ly the Russian troops of the territory which they
now occupy in Armenia, and which is to Le restored to Turkey. might give
rise to conflicts and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good
relations between the two countries, the Sublime Porte engages to carry into
effect without further delay the improvements and reforms demanded by
local requirements in the provinces inhabited by the Armenians, and to
guarantee their security against the Kurds and Circassians.
What followed has bassed into historv. The British Government of
which Lord Beaconsfield (then Mr. D'Israeli) was Premier. and Lord Salis-
bury Foreign Secretary, once more pursued the old policy of battling Russian
aggrandizement in Turkey. Atraid that her own real or fancied interests
would thereby Lecome imperilled, England threw in the weight of her power,
and virtually conmanded the substitution of the Treaty of Berlin in lieu of
the Treaty of San Stefano. Thus the substantial guarantee of a natural and
immediate protector, both able and desirous of entorcing the ,rotection which
the Armenians then had in Russia, was taken away, and the security of i:m-
potent words given in its stead, namely --
The Sublime Porte undert alies to carry out without further delay the
improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces
inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the
Circassians and Kurds. It will periodically make known the steps taken to
this effect to the l'owers, who will superintend their application.
11 will perioditally litalic the sleps taken to this iffect to the
Percers, willo will superintend their application." How this last proviso
could furnish food for laughter were it not for the terrible tragedy involved
in it.
The insertion of Article 61 in the Treaty of Berlin, granted, or rather
seemingly granted, by the six l'owers of Europe, proved in reality. as sub-
sequent events bore out, an instrument of death and torture. It was as it
the reversal of the figures had reversed the possibilities of succour and
protection, and with the death of the Cizar Liberator, the last chance of the
Armenians died.
The Turkish Massacres of 1575 and 1850 which led up to the Russo-
Turkish War of 1877 are historical facts too well known to need further
