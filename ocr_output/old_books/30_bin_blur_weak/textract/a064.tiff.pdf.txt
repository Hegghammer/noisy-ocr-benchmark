Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
Turkish rule ? To this question, IIC must ansiver an emphatic No!
The causes that must operate against any change are many and deep.
seated. In the first place it cannot be expected that it few Turks of liberal
ideas (or it may be French polished) at Constanticople, aic going to change
the
thought and character of the nation. The characteristics of a people:
change ery siowly, it the, ever change at all, and the predominant national
traits of the many blocded modern Turk have been shown to the world
to
be. cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a fince sensiality and what is
more
than all, and which has to be remembered most, is, that they are a
people accustomed to the unbridied gratification of their woist passions.
The thnographic traits of the Turkeman which history bears out, are
wildness and fierceness, and it would not I,". incorrect to argue that with the
instincts of his primitive ancestors have been assimilated the many
cross
currents that run in his veins, into all of which has been infused
the
doctrines of the religion of the sword, it religion which does not make
for
the peace or well being of mankind; a religion, also, which assigning one of
the thi sexes to the degraded position of being created solely for the gross
pleasure of the other, does not make for the esaluation of mankind.
To quote again the eminent acthority previously referred to :
No
Mahommedan race (11 dynasty has C.S.P shown itseli able 11) govern weil
subjects of its own religion, while to extend equal rights to subjects of
a difierent creed is torbidden by the very law of its being.
Not the Jewish conceit proclaiming itself God's diect and chosen, and
originating the name beathen' which it scorned Not the Christian conceit
cauanating from the lewish source, and laying the flattering unction
to
its
soul of superiority over the "heathen of its own time. Not the unbending
caste exclusiveness of the Brahman across whose pati cirn the shadow of
the dispised Sudra falling would be deemed detilement. Not any of these,
can equal the intolcrant religions pride of the Mahommedan, or reach the
pinnacle of religious self-sufficiency on which he has seated hiniselt. To be
a Mahommedan, is enough-Cila suffit.
To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans, and
intimate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahommedan is above all things a Mahommedan. His
religion is the paramount question in his life, and remains its predominating
feature above everything else. This should not be surprising, since to the
'faithful" Paradise is secured. and all crimes and transgressions against
unbelievers' absolved.
