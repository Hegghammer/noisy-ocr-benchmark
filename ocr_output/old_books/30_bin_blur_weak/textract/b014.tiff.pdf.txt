CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
the scene of which, by the way, he has not represented as a roval menagerie, but as a wild,
rocky cavern- - his animals partake of the artificial character of which we cannot bring ourselves to
approve.
Of this fact, however, me purpose to exhibit proof with our assertion. Improved versions, to
the best abilities of our Artists, of some of these Lions of RUBENS and the Assyrian king, will here
be introduced, which the reader, who pleases, may compare with the originals. Our second, third,
and fourth P'ates are of the number.
The Lions of ReBENS are humaniari. IIe do not intend to discuss at length whether the
ideality of allegorieal painting required this : we only state the fact : vet the opinions which
we
felt at liberty to form on the subject, me feel at liberty to utter. So much in apology for using the
licence of asserting that the beads of many of the Lions of Rt BENS rather resemble those of frowning
old geutlemen decorated with Ramillies wigs : as if Nature's journeymen had made mants, and not
made them well. There is a profusion of flowing and eurling hair, which seems rather to solicit
the unguents of the perfinner, than to have endured the torrid beats of the desert, or the rougli
storms of the forest. The shag of a Lion's mane is n very different sort of thing.
However such dressed Lions may be thought to accord with Allegory, they are demonstrably
at variance with Nature. To be sure, what might become a Lion in the procession of the Cardinal
Virtues, might be rather unsuitable in lis den, or within the precincts of those wild liaunts, where be
is accustomed to roam in lis natural state. We have often read of the fabled Men-bulls, or (Mino-
taurs,) and "1.'' find such: on the colmage of C'rete. These allegrorical creatures of RUBENS, which,
alas have sometimes been quoted by Artists without half his geuius, and placed in savage con-
flicts. or beside their are a species of Men-lions. l'laced among the Sabaran sculp-
tures, they might pass for incarnations of Sol in Leo; but would very ill pass for Leo alone.
Among the observers of this poetic improvement, or this natural and unpoetical deficieuey, on
the part of RUBENS, TITIAN, ROMANO, and other painters, both ancient and modern : and
of the consequent desideration on ilir part of the public, of a cabinet or library collection of the
nobler wild animals in a state of Nature, so as to answer the purposes of reference, while they con-
duced to the pleasures of Taste, were Mr. EDGAR SPILSBURY and Mr. THOMAS LANDSCER.
Whether oip not the public "looked to them for light" on that subject, (to use the language of
STERNE,) they thonglit the Public do deserved it ", and they therefore, as the best practical means
of eliciting that light, first copied the general forms and attitudes of most of the wild aninials that
appear in this book, from the old masters-geuerally speaking, from works that are well known
-and then, went to Nature and corrected the details. They carried with them what, in those
ancient masters, was meritorious in composition, attitude and chiaroscuro, and brought away,
to the best of their it to, and blending it with, the above-accuraey of
detail.
