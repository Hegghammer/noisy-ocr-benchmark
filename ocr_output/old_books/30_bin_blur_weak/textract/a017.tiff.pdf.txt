its these sheets are goung through: the press there comes news of famine
at %cition The Rev. F. W Macullum, American Missionary at Marash,
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet, American Missionary at Constantinople, that
I 3,000 souls in and around %.cimon are dying of hunger; they are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran and water, and cooking and eating it, ii they can
get even that. Rev. Macullum adds, The same story comes to us from all
sides. its III. foresaix all along, tro 11 now () the distress will be greatest.
If 50,000 were massacred, the list of those who have died and are dying
of homelessness and starvation will exced 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerated. Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.
The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolution of the massacres, has been plundered in a night attack
by armed Kurds, and the villagers are now reduced to extreme distress. Before
the outbreal the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeatedly appealed
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec-
tion tor the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended It is
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
