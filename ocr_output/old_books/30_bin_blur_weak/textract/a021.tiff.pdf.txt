babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and batchered
before the eves of their mothers, or that the ears of mothers should be rent
with the cries of the dying agony of their murdered children?
Does
Humanity, does Christianity allow that helpless women should be forcibly
subjected to the most hideous, the nost loathsome, the most revolting. and
the most cruel outrages Does Humanity, does Christianity, allow all this?
Christian Government have organized a Hague Conference of l'eace
and Civilization, but they have. closed it doors to the cause o: a bleeding
christian race groaning under the voke of the cruellese appressors that the
world has vel known. Christian men and women have held up their hands
in horror at the Indian Juggernauth ; but alas! the political wheels of
