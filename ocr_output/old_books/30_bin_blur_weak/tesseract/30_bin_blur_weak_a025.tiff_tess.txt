Further in answer to Aimed Riza Bey’s account of the .\rmenian
“preendus patrioards "in connection with the Ottoman Bank : Peannot do
beter than quote from Mr. Bryvce’s version of the story, and the massacre
that followed: -tIn the following June serous trouble arose at Van, where
some sort of insurrection is said te bave been planned, though in the discre-
pancy of the accoucts itis hard to arrive atthe truth. Masses of Nurcds
came down threatening to massacre the Christians, and a conict im winch
many innocent persons perished, was wath difficulty brought to an end by
the intervention of the British Consul, A hitde Inter the Armeniin revola
tionary party, emboldened by the rising in Crete, where the Christians, being
well armed and outumbenne the Muslims, held their ground successtully,
issued appeals to the Embassies and to the Turkish Goverament to introduce
reforms, threatening Cisturbanees ifthe policy of repression and massacre
was persisted in. “These threats were repeated in Aueust, and ulumuately,
on Aucust 26, a band otabout twenty Armenins, belonging the revolutionary
party, made a sudden attack on tne Impenal Ottoman Bank in Constan-
tinopie, declaring they were prepared to hold i and blow tt up should the
Sultan refuse ther demand. “They captured the balding by a camp ae uearit,
but were persuaded by toe Russian dragoman to withdraw upon a promise

dead. For two days an indiscriminate slauchter went on, tn which not only

trious and peaceable Armeniaas of the humbler class, clerks, domesuc ser-
vants, porters employed on the quays and in the warehouses, but also women
and children were butchered in the streets and hunted down all through the
suburbs. On the afternoon of the 27th the British Chareé d'Affaires (whose
acuon throughout won veneral approval) told the Sultan he would land
British sailors, and the Ambassadors teleraphed to the Sultan. ‘Then the
general massacre was stopped, thouch sporadic slaughter went on round the
city during the next few days. The Ambassadors, who did not hesitate
to declare that the massacre had been organised by the Government,
estimated the pumber of killed at from 6200 to 7000; the otncial report
