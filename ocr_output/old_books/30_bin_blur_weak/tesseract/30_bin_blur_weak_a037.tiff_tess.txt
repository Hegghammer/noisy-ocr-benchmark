No one doubts that a creat forward movement is reaching its culminat-
ine point in the destiny of Asia. “Vhe West has learnt its abot religion (the
moral and guiding principle of mankind) trom the East, and now the East
would fain learn the Law of restuaint and the law of freedom (the protecting
principles of mankind) from the West Tnspired by tis fecting the liberal
Turks decided|y mean wel, and they are animated with a sincere desire to
cnstrc peace and security of life and property for the heterogencous peoples
under the ‘Lurkish sway, bute they themselves have bad to contend and still
have to contend with a fanaucal populace.

To the Mahommedan world at large tie Caliph of Islam is the envoy of
God, the sacredness of whose person must be tnviolate. Abdul Hamad, the
astute polittonin, Kaew that the security of lis sovereignty depended on his
Caliphal riglits, and his main volicy during the long period of his execrable
rein had been directed towards preserving and asserting the same; thus
we can see how his dethronement, which the liberal Turks would gladly have
accomplished simultaneously with the taauzuration of the Constitution, had
to be deferred to a later period, and how tt was necessary for the She k ul
Islam to pronounce the Caliph a traitor to bis sacted trust, a violator of the
holy law of the Prophet. before Ins dethronement could be dared or
accomplisied. -

The Christan Armenians in “Turkey live in the midst of the followers
of a hosale religion, with no power or force behind them which makes for
protection. Who Goes not know that the ereat numerical prepondezance ot
Hinduism keeps the balance of power in India, and restrains bloody religious
hosulites; and when we review the whole religtous histery of Christian
Furope, and that ternily long roll of crimes committed in the name of Him
who expounded Its religion with the parable of the Good Samarttan, and
the precept of loving one’s neighbour as one’s seif, we cannot feel surprise at
the fanatical outbursts of the followers of Mahommed, the founder ol a
religion whose coctrines certainly fall sbort of the humane principles

Minculcated by the Founder of Christianity. Tr autheotic historical facts: prove
to us that horrible and atrocious cruclties have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other relizionists, but on fellaw Christians of different
Genominations, how then can we expect better things from the Vark unless
some power or force restrain him ?

Christianity has now partly emancipated herself from the ferocities
which darkened and coured the red stream of blcod on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at large, religion is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite.
