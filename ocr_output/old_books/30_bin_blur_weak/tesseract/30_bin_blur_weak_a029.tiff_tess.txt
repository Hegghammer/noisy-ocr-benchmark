PART Tf.
THE ARAMIENTAN AMEASSACRES AND THE
TRENETY Ol BERLIN,

Since the gathering of the Plens otenttaries of europe at the fimous
Coneress of Berlin in 87S, and the signing of the sull more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armentin nation stands with ut
its parallel in history.

In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of Europe,
butan the interests of Humanity there should be attached toe that painting
the wording of Article Gt of the Treaty of Bertin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).

Ir was a curious irony of Fate, that although the tiking of ‘the
terrible stronzhoid of ars,” universally admitted te be one of the vreatest
aud most difhealt mittary exploits ever achieved, and the crowning success
of the Russian arms ta Asiate Vurkey, should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General: that aithoosh Armenian Generals ta the Russian
service had led to conquest, and Armenian soldiers fought, conquered aud
died, yet by these successes not only was ne amehoration attained of the
hard tate of their unbappy nation under Turkish rice, Lut that fate, hard
before, was made a hundredfold and even a tioausandfold harder.
