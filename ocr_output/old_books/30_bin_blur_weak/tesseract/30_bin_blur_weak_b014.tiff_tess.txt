2 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

the scene of which, by the way, he has not represented as a roval menagerie, but as a wild,
rocky cavern—his animals partake of the artificial character of which we cannot bring ourselves to
approve.

Of this fact, however, we purpose to exhibit proof with our assertion. Improved versions, to
the best abilities ef our Artists, of some of these Lions of RUBENS and the Assyrian king, will here
be introduced, which the reader, who pleases, may compare with the originals. Qur second, third,
and fourth Plates are of the number.

The Lions of RUBENS are damanized. We do not intend to discuss at length whether the
ideality of allegorical psinting required this: we only state the fact : vet the opinions which we
felt at liberty to form on the subject, we feel at liberty to utter. So much in apology for using the
licence of asserting that the heads of many of the Lions of Rt Bens rather resemble those of frowning
old ventlemen decorated with Ramillies wigs as if Nature’s journeymen had made manes, and not
made them well. There is a profusion of flowing and curling hair, which seems rather to solicit
the unguents of the perfinner, than to have endured the torrid heats of the desert, or the rough
storms of the forest. ‘The shag of a Lion's mane is a very different sort of thing,

However such dressed Lions may be thought to accord with Alievory, they are demonstrably
at variance with Nature. ‘To be sure, what might become a Lion in the procession of the Cardinal
Virtues, might be rather unsuitable in lis den, or within the precincts of those wild haunts, where he
is accustomed to rowm in dis uatural state. We have often read of the fabled Men-bulls, or (Mino-
taurs,) and we find such: on the coinage of Crete. These allegorical creatures of RURENS, which,
alas t have sometimes been quoted by Artists without half his genius, and placed in savage con-
Hicts. or beside their Britannias are a species of Men-lions. Placed among the Sabaan seulp-
tures, they might poss for incarnations of Sol in Lee; but would very ill pass for Leo alone.

Among the observers of this poetic improvement, or this natural and unpoetical deficieucy, on
the part of Rupens, Trriay, Jurio Romano, and other painters, both ancient and modern; and
of the consequent desideratiom on the part of the public, of a cabinet or livrary collection of the
nobler wild animals ina state of Nature, so as to answer the purposes of reference, while they con-
duced to the pleasures of Taste, were Mr. Epcar Spinspury and Mr. Tuomas Lanpsren.
Whether or not the public “looked up to them for light” on that subject, (to use the language of
STERNE,) they thought the Public “deserved it;" and they therefore, as the best. practical means
of eliciting that light, first copied the general forms and attitudes of most of the wild animals that
appear in this book, from the old masters—generally speaking, from works that are well known
—and then, went to Nature and corrected the details. They carried with them what, in those
Ancient masters, wis meritorious in composition, attitude and chiaroscuro, and brought away,
to the best of their abilitv—superadding it to, and blending it with, the above—accuracy of
detail.
