THER ARMENTAN AMIASSACKES AND THE
ARMENTAN PEOPLE

During a period extending over thirty years the civilized world has
heard of “Turkish Muassacres of .\rmenians.  Massacres of a nature so
ferocious and diaLolical, so bideous and revoltiay, that no pen could adequate:
ly describe their horrors

Writing in 1896, Mr. James Bryce, in his supplementary chapter to the
qth edition of his book © Transcaucasia and Ararat’ makes the following
grave comment :— :

“Twenty vears tsa short space in the Ife of a nation. But) these

three Great Empires, Russian, Turkish and Persian, the unfortunate ge¢o-
