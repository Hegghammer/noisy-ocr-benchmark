Thus it became the fate of the unfortunate Armenians to be the bruised
and mangled shuttle cock of powerful bats.
Much has been written and much has been said by great authorities,
— (lar more comprehensively an! by pens much more forable than my hamble
efforts could aspire to rcach) against the seiishness and callousness, the
inhumanity and cynicism of those vreat powers which have coldly looked on
and permitted the hellish atvocities and berrors of the Armenian Massacres.
The name ot William Ewart Gladstone is loved and revered by Armenians
all over the world; but the thunderings of that veteran statesman and the
denouncing protests of those though:ful men whose feelings of revolted
humanity have made themselves heard in sounding language, have fillen oa
stony ground ; they have been like the voices of men crying out in the wilder-
ness. Europe has turned a deat car to the condemnations of justice and
teath, even as she has turned a deat ear to the voice of Rahel weeping for
her slaughtered children.
