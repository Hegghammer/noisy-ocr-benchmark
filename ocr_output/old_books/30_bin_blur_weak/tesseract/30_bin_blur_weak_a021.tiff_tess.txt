earth as other nations? Does Humanity, does Christianity allow that tender
babes and children should be hideously and horribly muulated and butchered
before the eves of their mothers, or that the cars of mothers should be rent
with the cries of the dying agony of their murdered children? Does
Humanity, does Christianity allow that helpless women should be forcibly
subjected to the most hideous, the most loathsome, the most revolting, and
the most cruel outrazes? Does Humanity, does Christianity, allow all this?

| Christan Goveraments have organized a Hague Conference of Peace
and Civilization, but they nave. closed its doors to the cause ot a bleeding
chrisdan race groans uader the voke of the cruellest: oppressors chat the
world has vet known. Christian men aad women have held up their bands
in horror at the Indian Jussernauth; but alas! the political wheels ot
Curnistian Governments have been a Greater Jogvernauth for a helpless

Crristian Powers should be all sathered together, one against another, ia the
leapire of your Oppressors, as cavles sather tovether round a carcase, but
really there is no hetp for it; aad if you muse die Iideously by a hellish

extermination, for in any case, cach one of as muse secure his own political
aad commercial interests in this same Empire of your Oppressors.”
