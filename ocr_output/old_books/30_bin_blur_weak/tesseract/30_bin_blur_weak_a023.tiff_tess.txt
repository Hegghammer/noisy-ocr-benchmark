orgy, except to call them fiends incarnate : and who is the boli man who
can guarantee that these same flends incarnate have become metamorphosed
and changed all ofa sudden; or that the handful of liberal Turks at Con-
stantincple are capable of controlling and restraining them. We have not
even heard that the leaders and) participators of the last massacres have
been punished as they deserved : and whats the reason they are leit un-
punished ? because the Government is atraid to punish Mahommedans for
killing Ciistians: because the hiberal Turks dare not punish the © trae
believers " for killing “ Naftirs.”

The renvion of Mahommed, the religion of the sword, has been infesed
into the Turk, and to understand the effect of the religion of Mahommed
upon the ‘Turk, itis necessary to regard it from four aspects, or from four
points of analysis. First, the fundamental doctrine and Jaw of the religion.
Second, the character of the founder as an example to his tollowers, “Third,
the racial and ethnoevraphic characteristics of the “Turk. Tourth, the effect
which this particular rehgien would be likery to live on this particular race.
When we have viewed the Turk and his government from these four poms
of analysis, we have the explanauon of all the woe and desolation which
have Jain over the countries under Turkish rule.

“When ve encounter the unbchevers strike otf thetr teads unul you
have made a great slaughter of them" is a chapter of the Koran which the
Turk has religiously and steadfastly made his creed.

In conclusion, I willask my readers to compare one point of ditterence
between the two races, the oppressor and the oppressed. Thousands upon
thousands of Armenian women, thousands upon thousanes of Armenian
children, have beea hounded to death, or savagely, fereciousiy, horribly and
loathsomely inaktreated by che Turk, and yet in all the agonizing years when
Massacre has succeeded upon Massacre, has there been one keown case or
one stage tastance of a Tirkish weman or child maltreated by Armentans ?

The last massacres though especially organized from the Paice at
Constantnople, were officially announced to originate from an atiray
between one Armenian and three ‘Purks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, vrappling with the three on the other, killed ene of the three :
wiven equal numbers and arms, the Armenian is always aimatch tor the
Turk, but alas tor hia that unequat numbers and want offarms have always
made him the victim of his oppressor.

Ahmed Riza Bey in the first part (Ses Causes) of his book “ La Crise de
[Orient published ia Paris in 1907 holds a brich for his nation which
through its own fallacious arguments falls to the ground. PE wul quote one
passage as an example.
