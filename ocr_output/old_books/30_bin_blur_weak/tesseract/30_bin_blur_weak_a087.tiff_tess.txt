Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have cluig to their christian faith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure.

The cathedral of Ktchnitatzin built by Gresory still stands to-day, it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, until perhaps
little of the original building may be left, bat ic still claims to be the church
built by the patron saint of Armenia, To shall here quote a passage from
‘Historical Sketch of the Armenian Church,” written by an Armenian
priest :

“Owing to political circumstances the Armenian Patnarchate had at
umes to be transferred to metropolises and to other principal towns of
Armenia. In the year A.D). ps2 it was removed to Dwin, in g93 to Ani,
in rieg to Romblah, and in 129.4 to Sis. The Kingdom of Cilicia becoming
extinct, and, we having no more a kingdom anloo longer a capital town, it
was natural and proper to re-transfer the See to its own oriwinal place, as
the entire nation unanimously desired it, Accordingly, in the vear rgg4, at

- was decided by an ecclesiastical meeting that the seat ot the Catholicus should
return to Holy Ftchmiatzin, where to this day has been preserved the
proper unbroken succession from our Aposties and trom cur holy lather,
St. Gregory the EHluminator.”

Tread the other day in cne of the foreign papers published in) Japan,
the following piece of news : .

“Aa Armenian Church pronounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christian era, has been discovered in al fair state of preserva:
tion in the neighbourheod of Bash Aparnah.”

Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light on Armenian history.
