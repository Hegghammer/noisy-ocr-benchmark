INTRODUCTION
TO 2sp PRENTING,

My object tn writing this little book ts to iay the hard case et my un:
fortunate race betore the men and women of the United States : since it ts

and Just of phinder, break forth and run in fiery streams; the untortunate

eo into print. The human mind is staggered and asks itself the question if
even the imaginations of fends and devils could originate such horrors,
Then this orgy of the hnman fiends is arrested, For the time being the
