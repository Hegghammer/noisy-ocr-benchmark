CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS,
DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.

Tuat there has hitherto existed no good book of Engravines of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the provress of the student in that department of Art, is to be reeretted. The talents
of Mr. Jonun Scorr, brou¢ht mto action by those of Ginrin, Cooper, and the REINAGLEs,
have presented the public with excellent: representations of the distineuished ornaments of the
turf: the sports of the field, and the habits and inanners of the canine race, were also duly
hononred: but of the ferocions Tiger trihe, and the lordly Liox, we have nothine extant that
would bear critical inspection, beyond a few detached prints:—nothing like a collection. of
ficures, whose justness and accuracy of form, action, character, and expression, mizht be
relied on.

Does any reader imagine that the varions Etchings which have been performed—chietly
abroad —by Artists of no mean ability, may be consdered as exceptions? They are not exceptions :
or at best, the muinber which might: be so revarded is but small, and those, for the most part, of
dimensions not accommodated to the drawer of the cabinet, or the shelf of the library.

But they are not objectionable on this eround alone. Speaking of them in the averecate, the
heavier charge lies against them of being insuflicient to those purposes of taste and information
which are the ends of Art. Even those after Trrmvs and after RUBENS (the latter of whom has
perhaps painted a vreater nuinber than any other of the old masters) are fir more deficient in
form, character, and expression, than is generally supposed, or than will be easily believed, by
those who have not actually compared them with the Lions, Leopards, and Tivers of Nature.
They have been taken too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
—Nor is this intended toimpugn the merits, as historical or poetical painters, of those distineuished
Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that as a painter of allegory, Rubens
might consider that strong infusion of daaman form, character, and expression, by which his Lions,
for example, are distinguished, as necessary, or conducive, to his allegorical purposes; or, it is pos-
sible that his knowledge of this animal may not have been thoronghly well-grounded, and that he
mav have laboured under early prejudice of imind, cr of vision, in this part of his education as a
Painter, and may not have seen Lions as they really are. This is what the writer is most inclined
to believe, (though not to insist); for even in treating the subject of Daniel in the den of Lions—
