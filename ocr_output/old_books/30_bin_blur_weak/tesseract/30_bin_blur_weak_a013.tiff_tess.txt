WHY AND AWIHEREPORE,

la making a study of my race, Phave found three marked characteristics
Intelligence —Pnergy—Industry. Combined with these three characteristics
Is an intense Love of Nationality. We live in a complex world. In an
independent people these characteristics and this sentiment are laudable
Virtues. Ina subject people they are Crimes.

Meter Thad laid this bitter Vruth to heart, I did not have to seek for the
Why and Wheretore of the Armenian Massacres.

The Armenian Massacres stand without their parallel in history. “The
himan mind stageers to contemplate the fiendish orgies of which they have
been the victims, and no pen can describe their horrors: and this helpless
christian peopic are to-day in the same deadly peril as they have been since
the fumous Vreaty of Berlin consigned them bound hand and foot to the
mercy of their executioners.

The Armenians may be led again ‘as sheep to the slaughter’ and the
work of extermination may be completed— Jesus Christ was crucified on
Calvary and the servant ts not ereater than his Lord—but the work of their
extermination can ealy be completed when the evil induences in the Turkish
apie have reached their calminating potnt. Hitherto the Powers of
leurope have by their jealoustes and rivalries cultivated these evil iaticeaces,
they have watered them and made them grow, but when their culminating
point. is reached, they must react on Christendom and the natural
consequence must follow. Those who sow the wind, must reap the whirl-
wind, tis ia the natural order of things.

} will allow that Liberty, Justice, Equality, Fraternity are the watchwords
of Young ‘Turkey, but Young Turkey is only a small minority ; the creat
majority of the Turkish nation are not Youny Turks.

The question therefore resolves itself into this criucal point: “What wiil
Christendom do even now?”
