Can the Armentans hope now for any chanee in their condition under
‘Turkish rule?) To this question, we must answer an emphatic No |

Yhe causes that must operate against any chenve are many and deep-
seated. To the first place tt cannot be expected that a few Turks of liberal
ideas (or it may be French polished) at Constantwople, are going to change
the thoucht and character of the nation, The characteristics of a people
chanec very slowly, i they ever change atall, and the predominant national
traits of the many blocded modern Turk have been shown to the world to
be, cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a tierce senstality ; and what is
more than all, and which has to be remembered most, ts, that they are a
people accustomed to the unbridled gratification of thetr worst passions.

Phe ethnographic traits of the “Vurkman which history bears out, are
widness and flerceness, and it would not be: incorreet’ to argue that with the
instincts of hts primitive ancestors have been assimilated the many cross
currents that run in his) veins, inte all of which lias been infused the
doctrines of the religion of the sword, a religion which Coes not make for
the peace or well beme of mankiid; a religion, also, which assigning one of
the two sexes to the degraded position of being created: solely for the gross
pleasure of the other, does notimake for the exaltation ot inankind.

To quote again the eminent acthoriiy. previously referred to: © No
Mahominedan race ov dynasty has ever shown itscl able to vovern weil
even subjects of its own religion, while to extend equal rights to subjects of
a different creed is forbidden by the very law of its being.”

Not the Jewish conceit proclaimiay itself God's clect and chosen, and
originating the name “heathen " which it scorned. Not the Christian conceit
emanating from the Jewish source, and laying the flattering unction to. its
soul of superiority over the “heathen "of its own tine. Not the unbending
vaste exclusiveness of the Brahman across whose path even the shadow of
the despised Sucdra falling would be deemed deflement. Not any of these,
can equal the intolerant religions pride of the Mahonimedan, or reach the
pmnacle of religious selfsufticiency on which he has seated himselt, “Vo be
a Mahommedan, is enough— Cela suffit.

To any ene who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans, and
intimate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahemmedan is above all things a Mahommedan. His
icheion is the paramount question in his life, and remains its predominating
feature above everything else. ‘This should not be surprising, since to the
“faithfel Paradise is secured, and all crimes and transeressions against
“unbelievers absolved.
