of the Porte bave been unreasonably forgotten or neglected. They are fully
as wretched as the Slavs or Cretans have been: and in so far worse off,
that in Europe there exists no large Locdy of tribes making murder and
robbery its reguiar and daily occupation as the INurds, and latterly the
Circassians also, have done in Armenia. Tfanyone will take the trouble to
read the complaints of Oppressions and cruclties presented to the Porte by
the Armenian Patriarchate in $72 (since reprinted in England) ard some ot
the more recent statements printer by the Armenians ino Kovland on the
same topic, he wilsee that the state of “Turkish Asia presents as grave and
pressing a problem as that or Bulearke itsecf”

In the th edition of the same book. published in 189%, the following
note appears to the passave T have quoted ;

‘Shortly after dus was written, the Blue Books presented to Parha-

the Constitution. TP do aot question the goodwill of the reform party, but
the reform party does rot comprise the whole Turkish nation, and until the
Turk learns to beceme literal, civilized and haman, there may be no more
Armenians left, umess some Christan Power such as the United States
demands ther protection and enforces it. No! my Christian friends, it can
be well for other Christians in the Turkish Empire with their powerful
Governments at their back ; bat alas! there is no security for a subject
people ahen in race and religion,

The massacres in April last raged from Adana to Alexaneretta, and
accorcing to authenticated reports about fifty thousand men, women and
children were hideously exterminated; more than this, the last massacres
were especially characterized by the most hiGeous, the most loathsome, the
most revolting and ferocious cruelties perpetrated on women and children.
Now what other name can we find for the perpetraters of this diabolical
