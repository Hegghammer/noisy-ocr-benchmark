LOAVEENTT.

Ja the loregoing paves T have directed my humble etlorts to sketch out
what the Powers of Kurope have done in the past, and how their actions
have reflected on my untortunate race.

It is considered Good policy now by a certain class of European writers
to ascribe all the horrors of the Armenian Massacres to Hamid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as unassailable and unconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as a sort of superhuman being who swept everything
before him to the consummation of his own despotic wil. The reason for
this is not difficult to perceive. “They would fain disavow the part Europe
has played in the tragedy, and to do this successtuily it becomes necessary
also tu present Turkey to the world now as a paradise (from whence the
tyrant once removed) peopled onty by saiats and angels: so we have also
many roseate colored word pactures of Constitutional ‘Turkey.

The murders, deportations and imprisonments of the “Turkish revolu-
tionaries, Or more correeay reformers, were unadoubtediy the sole work ot
Abdul Hamid and bis palace clique, but Abdul and bis minions counl not
have carried out that hellish work of wholesale extermination of the
Armenians without the perpetraton and participation of the “Turkish

people. Tt as truce the massacres were originated and organized in’ the
Palace, the Paiace Gique stirred up rehgious fanaticism and race hatred, bit
the co-operation of the people was necessary: and the people co-operated
in order to plunder and enrich themselves with the woridly goods that the
Armenians always knew how to acauire by their own industry and toil; the
appeal to their marauding and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work fora race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by alout ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
