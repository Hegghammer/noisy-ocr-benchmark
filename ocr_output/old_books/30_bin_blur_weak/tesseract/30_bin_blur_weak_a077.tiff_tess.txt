T will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amiasia,
and relate the story of Ning Aram, who ended Mis brilliant: reien in B.C.
1796 alter ruling over Armenia tity-cisht years.

He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his dominions, and
grew to be so mighty ino battle that the neighbouring nations called his
country Aramia and the people were called Aramians, such names as
Armema or Armenians being no doubt later corruptions.

The tirst: victory of Aram was over Neuchar king of Media, whom he
took prisoner and put to death, and made a large part of the country of the
defeated prince tributary to his own. ‘The second victory of Aram was over
Barsham king of Babylon, whom also he took prisoner and put to death.
The next victory was over the king of Cappadocia; the anny of the

designated by foreign writers as “a people of Semitic race language and
religion, coming trom Northern Arabia and setthng in the region between
the western Loundaries of Gabylonia and the highlands of Western .Vsia”
were no other than the Hai who under their King ram had spread their
conquests and their kinydom into Mesopetamia and even to the shores of
the Mediterranean.

Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when he includes
Northern Mesopotanua, together with the mountainous country of Ararat,
under the name of Armenia, and ia weitng of the Armenian boats that
