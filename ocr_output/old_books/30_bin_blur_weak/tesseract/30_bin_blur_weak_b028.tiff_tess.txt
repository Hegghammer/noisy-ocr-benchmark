G CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

and carnivorous habits. They walk on their tues: vet not so much from that habitual stealthiness
of pace, by which they advance unperceived till within a spring of their prey ; as because it is also
the means of that celerity of motion which is necessary to the very existence of animals that can
fleed only on flesh.

Their claws are exceedingly powerful; and they are enabled to draw them up into sheaths
between their toes, so as to prevent their points from touching the ground ; whence they are
called retractile ; and those claws are, in consequence, always kept sharp, unworn, and ready for
active service.

The eves of the Feline tribe — of every face in nature a striking and important feature—vary
in the different species, and are capable of much alteration in the same animal; as instinctive
impulse, or internal emotion, changes the expression of his countenance ; and also from the
decrees of light which act upon their pupils. Of Liens the pupils of the eyes are circular, and
not of a yellow colour, as has been stated in the most diffuse modern dissertations on the
Carnivora, but black. It is the iris of the Lion’s eve that is vellow. They appear to be best
suited to nectarnal, or twilight, vision; and hence the Lion rarely hunts his prey while the sun
is above the horizon—perbaps never, but when pressed by hunger in an extraordinary degree.
The Tiger, ou the contrary, will seek lis prey by day as well as by night; und during twilight the
colour of jis eves is that of a blue-green flame. [fa stranger passes near a Tiger ina menayerie,
the colour of the animal's eves will sometimes alter suddenly, from vellow-green to blue-green ;
nut from any alteration in the deeree of light actiny upon them, but from mental excitement, and
from a certain natural facility of expansion and cuntraction of the eve-pupils.

Hence a characteristic difference betwee n the Lion and the ‘Tiger. The habits of the latter
are diurnal, and he disrewards night-fires : the Lion, on the contrary, whose eyes are not calculated
for the glare of day, cannot bear to encounter fire-leht at night. Yet these physical conforma-
tions are sometimes overcome by the rage of hunger; and hence, in Mr. Epwin Lanpsven’s
contending ¢reup, the Liou is represented as attacking the Tiver although it be day.

Mu. Benr treats learnedly, and we believe with anuch originality, of the facial-museles of
this class of quadrupeds, in his “ Anatomy of Expression.”"—We shall offer a few extracts, by
which the reader will perceive how limited are their powers of expression of countenance, when
compared with those of human nature, notwithstanding their superiority over all other quadrupeds,

“The violent: passions mark themselves so distinctly on the countenances both of men and
of animals, that we are apt in the first instance to consider the movements by which they are
indicated, as certain signs or characters provided by Nature, for the express purpose of intimating
the mternal emotion 5 and to suppose that they are interpreted by the observer ID consequence of a
peculiar and instinctive faculty. ‘This view of things, however, so natural at first sight, is not
altovether satisfactory to philosophy ; and a more Jealous observation of the facts, seems to suggest
