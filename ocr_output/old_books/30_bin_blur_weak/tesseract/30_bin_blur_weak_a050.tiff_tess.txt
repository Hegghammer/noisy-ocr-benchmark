two, the wall of iron that rises between them is the position ofwoman. The
Armenian has accepted whole-heartedly the position in: which woman has
heen placed by the Great Founder of his faith, For seventeen hundred
years unremittingly since Christianity was revived in Armenia by Gregory
the Hluminator, the Christian law with regard to the position of woman has
moulded the thought of the nation, it has left its impress on the nation, and
itis this viraland essenual dittereace between the law of Mahommed and the
law of Christ that like a twoedeed sword has cleaved apart Christian
Armenian from Moslem Turk and Persian.

It Fastis East. and West is West" itis on account of the social plane

of Europe had stood in awe, and against whom not one had ventured single-
handed to engage.
