smell of corpses is in’ the air, the odor from the carcases of the “chrisuan
swine” reek in the nostrils of the Turk, he turas away, his jaws dripping with
blood, and rests to couch fora future spring. We have seen that sortof an
end to the tragedy ofa uver’s vicum: the tiger has eaten his fill, he rests,
to keep guard over the crunched bones and mangled bits of bloody flesh that
bestrew the earth. So also now there is a residue left of those that have
served 2s the meat and wine of this devil's feast; the demons have gorged
themselves over the banquet, and now there are left over the broken remains
of the banquet, the miserable residue homeless and destitute.

Civilized nations have received a temporary moral shock, ike a shock
that spreads from the centre of an explosion ; the electric vibration runaing
far and wide froin the scene of the centre of devastation. There are among
these civilized nations generous and kind hearted people who open their
purse strings ; they give money to purchase shelter, food and clothing for
these homeless, naked and. hunery begvars, made homeless, naked and
hungry through no faultof their own. Butoh! ye generous and kind heart
ed people! can any power under heaven assuage the heart anguish of this
miserable residue? Can they be made by any means of human comfort to
foreet the black horrors or recover from the effects of the fires of the hideous
affliction through which they have passed?) What is there left for a woman
who has seen with her own cyes the slaughter and heard with her own ears
the dying cry of her murdered child ? even her reason must give way under
the stress of her anguish. All ye who are mothers, TL appeal to you, tor one
moment to put yourselves tn the place of thousands of such mothers, in
whose hearts the same mother’s love burns as in yours, and then measure
the depth of their agony.

Generous and kind hearted people who open your purse strings; would
to God T entreat, ve would raise up your voices and demand that this hideous
slaughter and oppression of a helpless christian race should cease. \Would
to God IT entreat, ye would raise up vour voices and demand that this people
ofan industrious, intellizent christian race, robust in mind and body, should
be let to jive. Wourd to God T catreat, that ye would raise up your voices
and demand for them that security of life and property to which they are
entitled just as equally as all other peoples.

Public Sentiment has done ereat things in the world’s history. Public
Seatinent liberated Greece, The Lebanon, The Balkan States from Turkish
Oppression, Slavery was abolished in the United States through Public
Sentiment: but alas! does Pablic Sentment sleep for this helpless Christian
race. .\re they not God's creatures? have they not a right to live on Ged’s
