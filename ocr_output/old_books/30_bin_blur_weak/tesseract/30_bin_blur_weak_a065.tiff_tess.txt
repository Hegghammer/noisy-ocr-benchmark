Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, tailucaces of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in ‘Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this super-added eve, is, the
large neibouring bodies ot Kurds and Circassians, greater marauders and
depredators than the Vurks, the regular occupation of whose lives comprise -
murder and rebbery, and who have through weary centuries unrenuttingly
quartered themselves upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits of thetr labour and toil, Indeed as the Hamidich cavaliy which
was established expressivy fer tae Hoemidtan massacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation what oulet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized inurder, can now find for those habits in
which they were encouraged and trained to indulee by the Hamidian
réecune.

Under all such conditions no hope of better days can be forthcoming.
no prospect of better times seems possible, for that unhappy portion ef the
Armenian race whom torce of circumstances keeps on the soil of the
fatherland.

The appoimtunent of Christan governors over the provinces in-
habited Gy them might ameliorates some of the evils, or the other alternative,
of allowins the use of arms to all alike, irrespective of creed or
nationality, would furaish some means of selfdefence against the raids
and barbarities of the oppressors; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christian peasant subject to Turkish rule, and living in the mudst
of his cne vies, must remain one long struggle and batde against pillage,
mutder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Notthe most fertile
soil, not the most tavourable climatic conditions, not the most assiduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, can bring to the
Armenian peasant under ‘Vurkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
happiness, and security of lite and property, which the law of all civilized
countries vnarantees to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil.
