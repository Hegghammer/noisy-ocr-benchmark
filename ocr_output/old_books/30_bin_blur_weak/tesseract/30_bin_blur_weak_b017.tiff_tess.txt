CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. 3

Tivery artist does best, that which he is best qualified and best disposed to do. In com-
pleting the number of plates that has been found necessary for the Work, Mr. Epwix LaNbSEER
haz chosen to proceed toward the same purpose, upon a different principle. He has gone, without
any introductory medium, directly to the living animals, and has exhibited the savage manners and
habits of these quadrupeds, according to his own ideas and observations.

~ On the distinction between CHARACTER and Expression, we shall now deliver our opinion.
By the Character of an animal, we mean those permanencies of his look and features which he
always offers to view when in a placid, or unimpassioned state: by his /¢rpression, the variations
of muscular action superinduced on character, to which he is liable, as the storins of passion sweep
by, and hig mind becomes agitated by external cireumstances acting on the ardours of his instinct.

The former, seems to hold its court in the solid and massy parts: the latter, agitates, oft-
times rebelliously, the nerves and muscles. Character is ever present, both in the animal coun-
tenance, and in the “human face divine.” The inost violent expression does not proscribe, or
obliterate, character. Individuality consists of it, ag far as concerns eaternal appearance ; and it
forms the system of vowels of the languave of Nature, without which no Expression could be.

Whoever regards the faces of a flock of Sheep, will see in them an infinite variety of Character,
with very little Expression, and that little without diversity: and if we descend a step lower i
the scale of being, and contemplate the finny tribe, where Character is not wanting, we find no
Expression at all. Even Trees and inanimate objects, possess Character. We recollect a poctical
friend of ours, now in Ttaly, saying that every tree and every rock had a fiec—but of this we are
not so certain; thouch very certain, that there is enough of Character in rocks and trees, to make
n poet think so.

Character and Expression, in the carnivorous class of animals, to which we here solicit
attention, are always co-existent — their proportions varving with the existing oveasions —in
pictorial exhibitions of such subjects.

Ture is much Character, and lite Expression, in the reposing Leopard with his sheathed
claws, which is shewn in the present engraving, copied by Mr. Srirspery from Ripincen, and
corrected from Nature. RipinGer was an artist of great power, who studied wild animals in
their sequestered baunts, as is shewn in his grand forest back-grounds ; and who, wenerally
speaking, left little or no room for others to improve, except on some few of his inferiér works.
The present is an interesting and beautiful animal, vet there isa latent capability of mischief
characterised in his countenance, and we might ask, in the language of Job, “ Who shall dare to
rouse him up ?”
