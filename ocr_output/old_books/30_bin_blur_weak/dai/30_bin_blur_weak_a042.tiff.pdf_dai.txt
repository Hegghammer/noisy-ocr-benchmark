Van, and the west estimate e muted the murdered dead at 10 1909. Gladstone mad; the
last great speech of his het de life. England attempted some kind of protest. Bat rather
than join the Liberal demand for action, Lord Rosebery Left his perte for private leisure, and
Russia, France, and Germany combined to secure intaunity for the great assassin." It
was the lowest point of Earope's shame,
Blow followed Mas, Hindly had the remnant of the Norenian people escaped from
massacre when their Chauch fel under the brutal domination of Russia. Pishve ordained its
destraction, and Golitzin was sent to Tiflis as governor general to carry it out Church
property to the value of £5,000,000 was seized by violace, the Katholikos resolutely refitsing

For two yeGLES
the Russian othcials played with the revenues, retaining eighty per cent. for their own
advantage. Tint in the thean time assassination, lad tid the earth of Plehve, and the over-
whchaing defeats of Russia in Mann hatia were attribated to the Armenian car se, Grudgingly
the Church property was restore i, za niter chaos, and for the moment it is Russia's policy to
favor the Armenians as a balance against the Georgians, whom the St. Petersbarg government

Such was the past upon which the worn old man, stretched on his manastic bed, looked
back that winter's morning. Singleness of aim has its reward in spiritaal pence, list of the
¡ture he was not hopefàl. He no longer even e intermplate I am aat asmons Armenia, either
on Turkish territory or on Russian. On the R..
assian side of the frontier the Armenian
villages were too scattered, too much interspersed with Gisorgians and Tartars, to allow
of autonomy. On the Turkish side, he thought, massacre and exile had now left too few of
the race t - fort any kind of community, Inded, for the last twelve yenis the Armenian
villagers have been crawling over the foot of Aracat by theusands a year to escape the Kurds,
and every morning they coque and stand in nesh groups of pink and blue rags outside the
monastery door where the head of their Charch and face li's dying. They stand there in
mute appeal, 1 saw them, possessing nothing in the world but the variegated tatters
that cover them, and their faith in their Katholik s. Slowly they are drafted away into
Tiffs, Baku, or their Cancasian vikages, bat n where are they welcomed.
Some of the bishops and monks, who form a couriel reand their chief, still look for
Emope's interference, and trust that the solema p elges taken by England and other Powers
at Beilin may be fulfilled. The Bishop of Erivan, for instance, still labors for the appoints
ment of a Christian governo; over the district muked by the ill- onsned names of Van, Bitlis,
and Erzerzut, I also found that even among the Georgians there was a large party willing
to concede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian villages me thickest,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Cancasus wins federal
autonomy. Bat the majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and ind istries. One cannot yet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolationary parties of "The_Beil" and "The Flag. Of these,
the Social Democratic Bell follows the usual ingracticable and pedantic creed of St. Marx.
The Flag," or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a great
assembly held in Erivan last August 1906) they ad pted a programme of land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Charch property
by elected lavmen. If the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.
Whatever may be the political fature of the Armenians, they seen, likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a sárvival. It is a thousand years since they could be
