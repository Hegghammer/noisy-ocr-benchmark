THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
Friday noon (May 7) we made only 462 miles
This was partly accounted for by the fact that
we prked up Greenwich time at ( Clear
and put the clock ahead 1 hour and 40

expected that
when we sighted the Irish Coust the "Lucy"
would show a burst of "top speed" and that
we should go flying up at not less than 25
miles an hour. The run up to Thursday noot.
(May 6o hàị been 484 rales, and so confident
was I that she would put on steam that I
bought the high number in the pool for

I went into and I couldn't help it, for the
number sold at £300 and at that price at
looked like a "bargain."
During the forenoon of Thursday May 6)
we swung out and uncoveroj 22 Mfebrats, 11
on cach side, showing (aptain Turner's pic.
