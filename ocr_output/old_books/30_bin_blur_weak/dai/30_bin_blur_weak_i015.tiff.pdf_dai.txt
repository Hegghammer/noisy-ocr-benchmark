Remember that they know ret what they do
Who cinke in deadly fear and ghastly hate,
Remember that wer cho and at v√¶re time,
Each one exacts its hamar peralty
Remember that man's one. ner and man's mind
Air agents of Thy purjose and Thy plan,
Wh. ? mork within a deadler
Than any shraj nel shot or sabre throat,
Remember that new generations or
1 nowboon fall the burden and the cine,
The of old try and just wong
The crashing debt, the state and doya:.
Restra, O God the sweep of this vast hate.
Recall the nat, to their wa. shame
To those in banking war, to ival jeom
Reveal anen the mouse of the Christ
