SCENE OF THE MASSACRES IN ASTA MINOR.
The trouble began in Adana. An armed în strengthened and augmented by soldiers
fell in overwhelming numbers upon the unarmed Christians. The Armenian population of
Antisch and vicinity were practically wiped out and the Armenian villages in the
Alexandretta district destroyed with immense loss of hife. Hadjim, Kessab and the neigh-
buring villages were burned. The Armenian quarter in Tarsus was ruined and ill-omeïed
Marash stained again with the blood of thousands of Armenians. Zeitoon was desolated. The
entire population of Kirikon between Aleppo and Alexandretta were massacred to the last
babe. The mob and the soldiers burned what they could not carry away, so that the material
loss has been enormous, In place of the former abundavce and thriving industries, there are
instead desolated provinces and the charred and blackened remains of pillaged and ruined
homes, and the residue of those who escaped massacre are reduced to homelessness and
starvation.
