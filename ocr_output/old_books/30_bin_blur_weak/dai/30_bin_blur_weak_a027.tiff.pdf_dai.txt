was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples which with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, aard recognize the
Ottonian contutry as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engage in
commerce and agricakture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitiulness, increase the value of
the Otton an Empire. Because a few among them justly started an agitation, these var noble
and industrions brethren were being massagred. What a terrible scene! When
left the school building we saw hundrels of the belics of our Armenian compatriots Leing
removed in wamtre carts ; legs and arms were hanging down outside. This holy scene will
ever remain impressed
en my mind.
• This shocking crime of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a cursed absolatism, up to the last moment, grew
wisier. Even during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly teelings which had been shown,
the awful events in Adana took place and the souls of all trae Osmunlis melted into tears.
Up to the present ting the deep sorrow caused by this event has not disappeared, because this
bloody wound in our soc ial holy cannot ensily be cured. While we fill our stopschs with
choicë morsels, while we rest selfishly in our comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans, widows hungry, naked, and barefoot wander hither and thither, and thousands of
families are fleeing from the fatherland, We are convinced that the government is
doing its
work, but what has happene is so great a calamity that it can keep a government buy for
However mach sacrifice we may make, still it will be inadequate, because the
happiness of the fatherland depends on healing such blood wounds as these as soo11 AS· 
possible.
We´e 
are convinced that the government and all connected with it are persuaded of this as well as
omselves. We mast now wipe out the traces of the misfortune brought by a carsed period.
We must now comfort weeping parts. We must understand and teach those who do not
understand that patriotism an 1 brotherhood do not differ from each other. The responsibility
of the government for the Armenians is very great and very weighty. The whole Ottoman
nation is under obligations to protect this suffering race, le caus: the liberty we enjoy to-day
is in large part day to the blood shed by the Armeniaus, We thought that these truths
were so obvious that we preferred to keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary fiom time to time to ree all the greatness of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yesterday has endured only barbarism, and for twelve years
has been constantly oppressed and ground to the earth, and has given thousands of victims,
Herrafter we must work to assure them that the era of massacres has passed, and with all our
strength of mind and soul we mast quiet them. The obligation of the government to protect
them is also very heavy, because our Armenian countrymen live among wandering tribes.
We must all assist the government and point out its obligation. It mas; be declared in
pablic and periodically that the one of the most important duties of the Ottoman nation is to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and property of the
Armenians as well, since these are their sacred rights. Let investigations be made, and let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim.”

This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare disclose
his identity; and the account given by an authority like Mr. James Bryce
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as ·les Massacres occasionnés par les aventuriers Arméniens.”
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
