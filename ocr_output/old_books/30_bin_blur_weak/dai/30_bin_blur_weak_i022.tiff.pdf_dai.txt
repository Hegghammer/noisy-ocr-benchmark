THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
around the leck before lunch at 1 o'clock
I noticed that we were not going anywherr
near top speed and were following, no I re-
membered, the usual course up the Irish
Coast, that being about 5 to 7 males div.
tant I wondered at our loafing along at this
gentle pace.
When I bought my ticket at the Cunari
Office in Boston I asked if we were to be con-
voyed through the war zone, and the reply
made was, "Oh yes! every precaution will
be taken"
When we got into Querastown I found
the people finous through the net itself and
disgusted that three torpedo bout destroyers
should have lain at anchor in Queenstown
harbor all the time the Lusitania was conang
up the Irish Coast
Some of the men along
the sea front told me that these boats had
been out during the morning, but had come
back for "lunch They all turned up after
