like a round how, a great brown eye revealed the inward spint's inteligence and zeal un-

Khimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people—lowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery callest Etchmiatzin, or “The Only-Begotten
is Descended." From the window of a neighboring room he might have looked across the
frost bound plain of the Maxes, where the vines were now all cat close and buried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling snow and Intricane that hid the
cone of Araiat. And just beyond Armvat Ties Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of that Inke, eighty-seven years ago, Khrimian was bort. În 1820 the Tunkich
Empire was still undimini-ked by sea or land ; the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Grecce from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom -a
reputation which still rather pathetically savives thoughout the Near East. Long and
stormy had been the life upon silich the Katholikos now boked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to fast it lrad been inspired by one abonbing and anselfish aim the freedom and
reggeneration of his people. It is true he had failed
From his earliest years, when i'e had witnessed the terrors of Turkish oppresion in the
hommes of Armenians toand Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality -sach a
spirit as only kindles m oppressed races, but des away into easygoing tolerance among the
prosper as and contented of the world. He began as a poet, wandering for and wide through
the Turkish, Per-ian, and Rassian sections of Armenia, Visiting Constantinopie and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glonies of their national history,
Entering the monastic order after his wife's death, he devoted himself to the building of schools,
which he generously threw open to Kurd-, the nereditary assassins of Armenians,

Kroken his sacred emidens of the Host hung in mockery found the noche

his ofiice after four years.
But the cup of Turkish iniquity was tilling. The pitiless staughter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimtan found
him-elf samtnoted to plend his people's cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks language but Atinentan and Tarkish, he visites all the great courts of Europe

done with saccess for the Lebanon, In Londonhe became acquainted with Gladstone ; laat
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand schich had kindled the bent of England, and,

Articie 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kunds in check and

pledges were observed Beaconstield returned to London annid shouts of " Peace with Honor,"
and Armenia was left to sleW.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the wog increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake
