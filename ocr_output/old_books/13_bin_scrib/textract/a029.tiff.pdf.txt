PART I.
THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN.
ating
Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe, at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the shumore famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel in aistory.
In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of Europe,
but in the interests of Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood)
It was a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of "the
terrible stronghold of Kars," universally admitted to be one of the greatest
and most difficult military exploits ever achieved, and the crowning sudgess
of the Russian arms in Asiatic Turkey, should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General; that although Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest and Amenifo soldiers, fought conquered and
died, yet by these successes not only was no amelioration attained of the
bard fate of their unhappy nation under Turkish rule, but that fate, hard
before, was made a hundredfold and even a thousandfold harder.
GENERAL FRINCE LOHIS MELIKOTF
Commanded the Russian forces In Asiatic Turkes
during the Russo-Turkisk wor and captured the im-
ABB
pregnable fortress of Kars. Appointed Prime Minister
of Russia by Alexander H. The liberal policy which
characterized the reign of that excellent monarch, and
the Constitution that he was on the eve of granting
td
his people were influenced by Melikoft ; but after the
death of Alexander II he was not allowed to continut in
his good work of reforming Russia, being overthrown
from office early in the reign of Alexander III.
