THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.

Fairies, and attendant ladies are described. Of two of the danter it
is said-
"Their kirtles were of rede cendel,*
I laced smalle, jollyf, and well,
There might none gayer go."
In the French version of the same poem it is, we read, more fully
expressed. It says, "They were richly habited and very tightly laced."
The Lady Triamore is thus described
The lady was in a purple pall,
With gentill bodye and middle small."
Wharton quotes from an ancient poem, which he believes to date as
far back as I200, in which a lover, speaking of the object of his
admiration, thus throws down the gauntlet of challenge, and exclaims-
Middle her she hath mensk small."
The word mensk or maint being used instead of very or much. Some
differences of opinion have existed among writers as to the origin of the
word corset. Some are of opinion that the French words corps, the
body, and serrer (to tightly inclose or incase), led to the adoption of
the term. Madame La Sante gives it as her opinion, however, that t is
more probably a corruption of the single word corps, which was formerly
written cors, and may be taken as a diminutive form of it. Another
view of the matter has been that the name of a rich material called
corse, which was at one time extensively used in the manufacture of
corsets, may have been thus corrupted. This is scarcely probable, as
the word corset was in use at too early axpecied to admit of that origin.
Perhaps as earW an instance of the use of the term corset as any in
existence may Be found as a portion of an entry in the household register
of Eleanor, Countess of Leicester, which bears the date May 24, 1265:-
A rich description of silk.
