THE LUSITANIA'S
LAST VOYAGE
PART I
6, NEW OxFORD
May 12, 1915
OUR voyage from New York had been un-
eventful and in fact it was quite a "Lauriat
Crossing"; fine weather, smooth sea, and
after the first few hours of Sunday (May 2)
there had been no fog up to Friday morning
(May 7), when it came in for a short
time.
The speed of the boat had not been what
I had expected it would be, for after the first
full run of 24 hours, in which we covered
miles, the run dropped each day to well below
the 500 mark and the last 24 hours up to
( 3 )
