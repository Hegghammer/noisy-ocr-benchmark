SCENE OF THE MASSACRES IN ASIA MINOR.
The trouble began in Adana. An armed mob strengthened and augmented by soldiers
fell in overwhelming numbers upon the unarmed Christians. The Armenian population of
Antioch and vicinity were practically wiped out and the Armenian villages in the
Alexandretta district destroyed with immense loss of life. Hadjim, Kessab and the neigh-
bouring villages were burned. The Armenian quarter in Tarsus was rumed and
Marash stained again with the blood of thousands of Armenians. Zeitcon was desolated The
entire population of Kirikon between Aleppo and Alexandrett. were massacred to the lust
/
babe. The mob and the soldiers burned what they could not chrry away, so that the material
loss has been enormous. In place of the former abundance and thriving industries there are
instead desolated provinces and the charred and blackened remains of pillaged and ruined
homes, and the residue of those who escaped massacre are reduced to homelessness and
starvation.
