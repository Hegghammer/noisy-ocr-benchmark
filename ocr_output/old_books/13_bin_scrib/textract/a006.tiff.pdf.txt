When this book was written, the writer was
under the supposition then generally current that
the Armenian Massacres of April, 1909, in Cilicia
instigated by Abd-ul Hamid and his Yildiz
Clique. Babikian Effendi, the Armenian deputy
who went to Adana from Constantinople to in-
vestigate into the massacres, plainly reported that
all investigations had failed to trace them to Abd-ul
Hamid and his Yildiz Clique. Babikian Effendi,
as was to be expected, died suddenly on his return
to Colstantinople, but later on it became known
thatthemassacres of April, 1909, hadbeen planned,
prepared, organized and carried into execution by
v6
the Constitutional Government of what has been
talled Liberal Turks' or " Young Turks."
