THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
I went in and stood on the floor of our house my
heart was thumping within me at the thought of
what was before.
And there was the pot boiling over the fire with
a few green herbs in it. There was Saba, my
mother, stirring the last handful of meal amongst
the green herbs. And there were my brothers,
all older than I, sitting by the fire, waiting for
the herbs and the meal to be ready
When my mother looked toward us she saw the
Z
man from the strange boat. She thought that
some crime had been committed by me or my father
to bring a man of such high degree amongst us.
She and my brothers were greatly afraid, for they
were poor, and those who were high were harsh
to them. But the stranger spoke softly, saying,
"Good fortune has come to you from the sea
to-day." And when they all turned toward him
he said, "I who am very knowledgeable will take
your son with me as an apprentice, and Ishall
instruct him in arts and crafts and mysteries."
My mother said, "The boy is young, sir, and we
thought he would be with us for a time longer."
