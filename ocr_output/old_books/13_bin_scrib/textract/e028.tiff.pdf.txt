The Persians entertain much the same notions with regard to the
necessit for slenderness of form in the belles of their nation, but differ in
other matters from the Hindoos. The following illustration represents a
dancing-girl of Persia, and it will be seen that her figure bears no
indication of neglect of cultivation. It is somewhat curious that the
Chinese, with all their extraordinary ingenuity, have confined their
restrictive efforts to the feet of the ladies, leaving their waists unconfined.
That their doing so is more the result of long-established custom than
absence of admiration for elegantly-proportioned figures will be clearly
proved by the following extract from a letter published in Chambers

clearly not so, as the small-waisted young ladies of the "outer
barbarians' were to him much as some new and undescribed flowers or
birds would be to the wondering naturalist who first beheld them.
