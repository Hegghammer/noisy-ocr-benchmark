smell of corpses is in the air, the odor from the carcases of the “christian
swine” reek in the nostrils of the Turk, he turns away, his jaws dripping with
blood, and rests to couch for a future spring. We have seen that sort ofan

end to the tragedy of a tiger’s victim: the tiger has eaten his fill, sin
to keep guard over the crunched bones and mangled bits of blog 6h that
bestrew the earth. So also now there is a residue ose that’ have
served 2s the meat and wine of this devil’s feast ; {ie demons have gorged

of the ba he miserable residue homeless and destitute.

Civil ations have received a temporary moral shock, like a shock

whose hearts the same-mother’s love burns as in yours, and then measure

the depth of their agony. .
