of blackened ruins, the stark walls of the churehes and houses rising up out of the ashes and
charred timbers heaped on every side. Whit must it mean to the five thousand men and
women and little children who have survived a painful flight to the seacoast and hays,
returned to their mountain home, only to find their houses sacked and burned! ‘They were”
nine Christian villages which clustered about Kessab in the valleys below, ,Several of these
have been complete'y destroyed by tire. All have been plund srettite helpless people
driven out or slain.”

“Can you part®ine the feelings of the Kessab people as they climbed on foot the lung trail
up the mountgfnfAndthen as they came over the ridge into full view of their charred and
ruined dwellidgs ? ‘Yheir stores of wheat, ‘barley and rice had been burned ; clothing, cooking
utensils, furnibuzesfd tools had gone ; their goats, cows and mules had been stolen ; their silk
industries stamped out ; their beloved churches reduced to smouldering heaps. The bodies of
their friends and relatives who had been killed had not been buried. And yet the love of
home is so strong that the people have settled down there with the determination to clear up
the debris and rebuild their houses.” —Extracts from “ The Sack of Kessab,” Stephen Van HR.

As these sheets are going through the press there comes news of famnyfe
at Zeitoon. The Rev. F. W. Macullum, American Missionary at Malrdsh,
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet, American Missionary at Constantinople, ‘that
12,000 souls in and around Zeitoon are dying of hunger ; they are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran and water, and cooking and eating it, if they can
teven that. Rev. Mdeilhmauds-rne SAIS Story Comes to us from all
fies. As we foresaw all along, from now on the distress will be greatest.”
If 50,000 were massacred, the list of those who have died and are dying
of homelessness and_staryation will exceed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerated. Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.
The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian viJAge ghat had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered if a/nig]
by armed Kurds, and the villagers are now reduced to extreme distress. Before /
the utbreak_the Armenian patriarchal vicar at MugivhaJ repeatedly appeated -
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, an Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec-
tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It i
evident that the authorities at Constantinople-areunmahble to protect thrivin
Armenian va Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
