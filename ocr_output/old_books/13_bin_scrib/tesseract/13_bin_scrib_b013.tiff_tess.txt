. CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.

Tnat there has hitherto existed no good book of Engravings of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the progress of the student in that department of Art, is to be regretted. The talents
of Mr. Joun Scorr, brought into action by those of GitPrn, Cooppr, and the Rrracuss,
have presented the public with excellent representations of the distinguished ornaments of the
turf: the sports of the field, and the habits and manners of the caning race, were also duly
honoured: but of the ferocious TrGER tribe, and the lordly La ois extant that
would bear critical inspection, beyond a few detached, pfinee> nothing like a collection of

form, character, and expression, than is geners ly supposed, or than will be easily believed, by
those who have not actually compared them with the Lions, Leopards, and Tigers of Nature.
They have been taken too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
Nor is this intended_toimpugn the merits, as historical or poetical painters, of those distinguished
Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that as a painter of allegory, RubENs
might consider that strong infusion of human form, charfctgr, afd expression, by which his Lions,
