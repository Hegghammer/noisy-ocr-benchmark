Qe RODUCTION.
We give BarnapaS Horron as the Preface and Introduction to this
little volume of Chronicles. He was probably the son of Joseph
Horton, of Leicestershire, England, and born in the little hamlet of
Mousely of that shire. Of his history before he came to America very
little is known. He came over in the ship ‘‘ Swa//ow,"’ in 1633-38.
He landed at Flamptony was. How long he remained at Hampton
is not known. But in 1640 we find him with his wife and two chil-
dren in New Haven, Conn., in company with the Rev. John Youngs, .
William Welles, Esq., Peter Hallock, John Tuthill, Richard Terry,
froma Mapes, Matthias Corwin, Robert Ackerly, Jacob Corey, John
onklin, Isaac Arnold, and John Budd, and on the 21st day of
Oct., 1640, assisted by the venerable-ReyfoInr'Davetiporrand-aore
0% they organized themselves into a Congregational Church, and
Gago east end of Long Island, now Southold. They had all
be€f mefnbers of Puritan churches in England, and all had families
with them except Peter Halleck. “They doubtless had been on the
island previous to this time and looked out their homes. On nearing
the shore they cast lots to. decide who should first set foot on the land.
The lot fell on Peter Hallock, and the place where he stepped upon
the land has ever since been known as Hallock’s Landing. (
On coming ashore, they all knelt down and engaged in pray
Peter Hattoek leading, as had been determined by the lot. (6 )
were the first persons of any civilized nation that had ever attemp
to settle on the east end of Long Island. See Griffin's Journal.
Barnabas Horton was a man of deep-toned piety, and a warm advo-
cate of civil and religious freedom. He was one of thevnestpromic—
nent and influential magn Southold. He was for many years a ,
magistrate, and si member of the General Court at New
Haven and Harfor uilt the first framed dwelling-house ever
erected on the east of Long Island, and that house is still (1875)
standing and occupied. It is a shingle-house, that is, shingles are
used for weather-boards, and the sides have never been reshingled,
and the roof but once, according to the statement of Jonathan Gold:
smith Horton, the last Horton occupant of the old house.
