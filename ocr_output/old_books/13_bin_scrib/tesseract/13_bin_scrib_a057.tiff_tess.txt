thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the feared fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history, a

At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were th Struck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arriv@i frc stantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nereés, the Patriarch, their object heing to re: the signatory Powers of
the Berlin Treatyeto foree a guarantee from the Turkish Gov¥ernment to make certain
important impy6y, ts in Armenia.

summoned to Nye Palace. It is said that when he received the summons he simply smiled
and asked one of of his curates to read the Burial Service to him, as le did not expect to
return alive. However, he went. No one has ever heard what passed between the Sultan

cordial invitation was sent by a very high dignitary of the Palace, requesting the Arehhishop

The Pasha received him at the door and escorted the visitor with much ceremony and
extreme courtesy to a private apartment of the salamlik of his house (the men’s quarters),
where dinner was served. The geniality displayed by his host dispelled any fears that the
Archbishop might have had as to his personal safety.

After dinner, as usual, coffee was served. Now, this serving of the coffee id rather a
