42 THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.
British Museum bears on it the strange and anomaloys figu epfesented a
in the annexed illustration, Opinions vary somewhat as to whether
its origip-emight not have been Italian, but we see no reason for adopting
this ea consider it as of decidedly home production. It will be
seen that tHe shoulder, upper part of the arm, and figure are those of a
well-formed female, who wears an unmistakable corset, tightly laced, and ;
