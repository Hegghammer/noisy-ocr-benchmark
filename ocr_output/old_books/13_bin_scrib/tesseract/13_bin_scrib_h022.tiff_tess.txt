Southold. It is stilla long old gun, though not as long as it was

once, as it was bursted by overloading on one Thanksgiving Day, and

about eight or ten inches of the muzzle cut off. - ax

The cask, in which he packed a portion of his househo S$
and brought over with him, is still in existence, and is egmned by
Gilbert W Horton, of Bay View, Southold. It is doubly historic
from tho/f, hat when the British invaded Long Island it was filled
with wheat aX] buried, thus securing the wheat from the foraging
parties of The British army. It is made of solid oak—hoops and all—
the hoops are square and about an inch and a quarter thick—only one
hoop missing. It is used for a grain cask, and will hold about fifteen
bushels. It was formerly called ‘‘uncle Barney’s money barrel,” as
romance had it, that he brought it over full of gold and silver.

AENATRING oir is still preserved. It is made of the Yew tree
wood, has a fine ivory head with the letters «J. H.’’ and the figures
‘1617’’ in apparently golden specks indented into it, from which it |

| would seem that it once belonged to his father, and that J. H. (Joseph
Horton) were his initials. It is now owned by Silas R. Horton, of
Goshen, N. Y.
Many other mementos d*the*otdwukiem are existences Some of
T them in the Long Island Historical Rooms, Brooklyn, N. Y.

The Hortons in England, and their descendants in América, have
generally been cultivators of the soil. They have been found almost
universally in the middle class of society, and it is not known that
any royal blood has ever coursed in their vefits-"Mrép-ate7and always
have been, / s rather than consumers, and for industry, integ-

The first of the family who emigrated to this country, of whom we
have any authentic record, came over from England 1633 to 1638.
Thomas, Jeremiah, and Barnabas, were among the early emigrants,
and old tradition says they were brothers. Thomas came over in the
“* Mary and John,’’ in 1633, settled permanently in Springfield, Mass.
