CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. 5
No. VI.

In this Grour by Mr. Epwin Lanpszsnr there is much of violent animal Hupression, and
Character fades before it, or rather, is absorbed in it. It tells a story of the past as well as the
present, and is pregnant with a catastrophe not difficult to anticipate from the actions and
expressions of the parties engaged. A Fawn has been seized by a Leopard, who has been
despoiled of his prey by a more powerful T1cer. The Tiger in his turn becomes the victim of an
enraged Lion. _- :

The expression of the wounded Leopard is that of painful suffering mingled with dread.
Together, they amount to agony. He shrieks while he submits. The ‘Tiger is still enraged and
resisting, though astounded with the power and suddenness of the Lion’s attack. He is losing his
energy of resistance, and is beginning to feel that all resistance is vain. He roars with anguish;
while his expression is that of terror, and indignation not yet subdued., wn

The Lion, who has just made his thundering spring, appeay cious of havitie fatally seized
his adversary, and luxuriates fearlessly in his Ytoxypythd with a powerful and just expression of
carnivoroyseyigyment.—Meanwhile the chart€ters of the animals, severally, are faithfully and
specifically‘reprefented.

AltQoughAur main purpose be to exhibit rather a pictorial than a physiological view of the
subject: having descanted on the word Character, we shall probably be expected to add, at least
a word or two, on the leading characteristics of the carnivorous class of quadrupeds.
nAbsacrerignghurgcters of the Feline, or Cat, kind, are easily enumerated in the concise
language of the naturalists. Their heads are round; their visages short/ they have six cutting
teeth, and two eanine, in either jaw: their tongues are aculeated, the \pyickles inclining backward ;

| their claws sharp, hooked, and retractile ; their ears small and acuminated ; they have five toes on
each of the fore-feet, and four only on those behind.

d : Of this arcneva of Catsy we here cahitne ths four priacpal species, Lions, Tigers, Leopards,
and Panthers, of which the Lion is justly placed at the head—at least, the unanimous voice of ages
is-pronounced him to be the king of beasts, and we have enthronéd him accordingly in our Title-
page, (No. I.) They form a tribe that is especially and properly Carnivorous, being the only
class of quadrupeds that are exclusively flesh-caters. They jaws) are very completely armed for
this purpose ; their canine teeth being very long and angulaf, wit edg’ the angles turned
toward the inside of their mouths; so that when imal hfs caused phem to ctor cross each
“other in the"Hest of its prey, these formidable tepth wil¥ cut or tear a Way through, by drawing
them back without opening his mouth.

Their claws, and the formation of their feet, too, are eminently cpndufive to their predacious
