16 HALFHOURS WITH THE HIGHWAYMEN
entrusted to her keeping by a farmer attending
the market. To convince Ratsey how truste in
a person she was, she foolishly showed where mee
had placed_the bag; and as soon as her back was
turned (on taken it from the cupboard where
it lay, a ade off.
When the farmer returned and wanted his
money, there was the very deuce to pay. He and
the landlady went off to the nearest justice and
swore ar information against Gamaliel, who was
arrested and thrown into prison, but not before he
had found time to return home and bury the bag
in the garden. In confidence he told his mother
| where it was hid, his mother told his sister, his
sister told her husband, her husband told his
friends, and so at last the confession reached the
Cc / ears of the justices. Gamaliel would undoubtedly
ave been hanged on that occasion, only he broke
prison and escaped; ctad only in his shirt.
His further adventures with Snell and
Shorthose, two companions of like inclination,
are in themselves amusing when reduced to less (Y)
stilted language than that of the Life. Curiously ‘
errough,-ene of these incidents is concern
the robbing of an actor, whom Ratsey bids détiver
his money first, and a scene from Hamlet after-
wards. So it was not from any want of acquaint-
ance with the_best models that the unnamed
author ot fay life failed to put life into
his narrafivé-~ The incident is treated in as dead
and wooden a manner as the rest.
