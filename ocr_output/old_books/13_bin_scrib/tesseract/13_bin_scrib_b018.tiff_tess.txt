4 . CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
No. III.
Two CovcHant Lions, AFTER RuBEns, taken from his celebrated picture before alluded
. to, of the Prophet Daniel incarcerated in the den. The Lions are here supposed to be miraculously
held in a state of tranquillity. . Here, too, is not much Expression, but an extraordinary grandeur
of Character, suited to the greatness of an occasion where the Deity himself especially interferes
to seal up the voracious energies of the most terrible of his creatures, in calm submission. There
is a character of royal dignity mingled with this submission, which is very impressive, and even
sublime.

The writer esteems this to be a successful restoration of the Nature that was wanting in the
prints of this subject, (which has often been engraved by Picarr and others,) after Rubens. The
original picture it has been our ill-fortune never to have seen. ‘I'he shaggy manes, and tlie latent
terror that sits gloomily enthroned in the open eyes of the superior Lion—suited to the darkness of
the den, and the nature of this animal’s sense of vision, SRIF thous of, as they are
executed ; and are varied with much address tom boaibes he couching Lion beyond,
of which also the character is gmost ha; arked. A powerful and divine spell possesses

hem both.
O No. IV.

Tux TicER WHICH MARCHES IN OUR PROCESSION, without an object before him to call
forth emotion, possesses a calm character, combined with the resistless strength of that dreadful
quadruped ; whose very tranquillity, in his leisure sauntering, when no excitement is acting on his
nerves, lias an appalling effect.—His brow is clouded, tho¥gh his claws are sheathed. There is a
possibility of a dreadful storm which may not be far distant, and that is enough to stamp the
Tiger’s character. None shall dare to arouse his energies, nor to encounter them when aroused.
