was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples whieh with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who eng; ian
commerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase theguxwe of
the Ottoman Empire. Beeause a few among them justly started an agitatigr se our noble
and industrious brethren were being massacred. What a f{éyé scene! When we
left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our A¥menian compatriots being
removed in man arts ; legs and arms were hanging down outside. ‘This bloody scene will
ever remain infpyessQ\ on my mind, ,

“This ey of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this Jake, during the
whole course ofwttrsed absolutism, up to the last moment, grew wider. Even during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feelings which had been shown,
the awful events in Adana took place and the souls of all true Osmanlis melted into tears.
Up to the present time the deep sorrow caused by this event has not disappeared, beeause this
bloody wound in our social body cannot easily be cured. While we fill our stomachs with
choice morsels, while we rest selfishly in our comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans MaeenOneh Naced, and barefoot wander hither and thither, and thousands of

happiness of the fatherland depends on healing such blood wounds as these as soon as possible.
We are convineed that the government and all connected with it are persuaded of this as well as
ourselves. We must now wipe out the traces of the misfortune brought by a eursed period.

were so obvious that we paeferredto keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary from time to time to recall the greatness of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yesterday has endured only barbarism, and for twelve years
has been constantly oppressed and ground to the earth, and has given thousgets of victims.
