of the Porte have been unreasonably forgotten or neglected. They are fully
as wretched as the Slavs or Cretans have been ; and in so far worse off,
that in Europe there exists no large body of tribes making murder_and
robbery its regular and daily occupation as the Kurds, and lat Cane
Circassians also, have done in Armenia. If anyone will take ouble to
read the complaints of oppressions and cruelties Brg to the Porte by
the Armenian Patriarchate in 1872 (since reprintek{in England) and some ot
the more nt statements printed by the Armenians in England on the
same tog will see that the state of Turkish Asia presents a8 grave and
an ois as that of Bulgaria itself.”

In the 4th edition of the same book, published in 1896, the following
note appears to the passage I have quoted:

‘Shortly after this was written, the Blue Books presented to Parlia-
ment, containing reports from British Consuls in Asiatic Turkey, showed
that YAarey Wee Yeally far worse there than they had been in Bulgaria_or
Herzegovina.”

What has followed since 1876 is too well known. For seeking (fs

You will tell me, puachustian Kiends that with theise of the reform
party in Turkey, the era of massacres is at an end, and I will tell you that
the conditions of 1876 and 1896 have not actually changed, though they

ay seemingly appear so to the uninformed and uninitiated. I will answer
you that the hidegus massacres of April last happened nine months after the
reform party first rose in power, and nine months after the inauguration of
the Constitution. I do not question the goodwill of the reform party, but
the reform party does not comprise the whole Turkish natiof,Janfl until_the
Turk learns to become liberal, civilized and human, se 0 mete

demands their protection and enforces it. No Yefy fhristian friends-itéan -

Governments at their back; but alas! there is no security for a subj
people alien in race and religion.
