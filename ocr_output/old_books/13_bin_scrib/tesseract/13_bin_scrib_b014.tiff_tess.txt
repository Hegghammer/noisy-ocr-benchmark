2 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

the scene of which, by the way, he has not represented as a royal menagerie, but as a wild,

rocky cavern—his animals partake of the artificial character of which we cannot bring ourselves to
: approve. .

Of this fact, however, we purpose to exhibit proof with our assertion. Improved versions, to
the best abilities of our Artists, of some of these Lions of RusEns and the Assyrian king, will here
be introduced, which the reader, who pleases, may compare with the originals. Our second, third,
and fourth Plates are of the number.

The Lions of RuBENS are Aumanized. We do not intend to discuss at length whether the
ideality of allegorical painting required this: we only state the fact: yet the opinions which we
felt at liberty to form on the subject, we feel at liberty to utter. So much in apology for using the
licence of asserting that the heads of many of the Lions of RubEns rather resemble those of frowning
old gentlemen decorated with Ramillies wigs ; as if Nature’s journeymen had made manes, and not
made them well. There is a profusion of flowing and cuylire: hair, ich seems rather to solicit
the unguents of the perfumer, than to have mle pce Fah the desert, or the rough
storms of the forest. ‘The shag pf a Lion's is a very different sort of thing.

However such dressed tees toe to accord with Allegory, they are demonstrably
Avariance with Nature. To be'sure, what might become a Lion in the procession of the Cardinal

is accustomed to roam in his uatural state. We have often read of the fabled Men-bulls, or (Mino-

taurs,) and we find suck on the coinage of Crete. Tliese allegorical creatures of RuBENs, which,
