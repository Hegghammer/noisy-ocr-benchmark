L’AVENIR.

In the foregoing pages I have directed my humble efforts to sketch out
what The Poverty or Europe have done in the past, and how their actions
have reflected on my unfortunate race.

It is considered good policy now by a certain class of European \yfiters
to ascribe all the horrors of the Armenian Massacres to Hamid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as unassailable and unconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as_a sort of superhuman being who swept everything

efore him to the consummation of his own despotic wil, The reason for
this is not difficult to perceive. They would fain disavow the part Europe
has played in the tragedy, and to do this successfully it becomes necessary
also to present Turkey to the world now as a paradise (from whence the
tyrant once removed) peopled only by saints and angels; so we have also
many roseate colored word pictures of Constitutional Turkey.

The murders, deportations and imprisonments of the 2rkish revolu-
tionaries, or more correctly reformers, were undoubtedly phe/sole sdr_e
Abdul Hamid and his palace clique, but Abdul apd his iminiers Cond Te /
haxe carried out that hellish work of wholgsafe) extermination © € -
Armenians without the perpetration and Ga) cx of the Turkish
people. It is true the massacres were originated and organized in th
Palace, the Palace clique stirred up religious fanaticism and race hatred, fut
the co-operation of the people was ngcessary,,apd.the people ee
in order to plndex and enrich themselves with the worldly goods tligt the
Armenians ajff4ys knew how to acquire by their own industry and toil\\the
appeal nna gfe es and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
