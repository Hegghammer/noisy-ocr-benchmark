THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE. 45
Fairies, and attendant ladies are described. Of two pf the eet Tt a
is said— pews
«Their kirtles were of rede cendel,*
O I laced smalle, jollyf, and well;
There might none gayer go.”

In the French version of the same poem it is, we read, more fully
expressed, It says, “They were richly habited and very tightly laced.”
The Lady Triamore is thus described :-— ‘

VON Phe lady was in a purple pall, Wr
With gentill bodye and middle small.”

Wharton quotes from an ancient poem, which he believes to date as
far back as 1200, in which a lover, speaking of the object of his
admiration, thus throws down the gauntlet of challenge, and exclaims— |

Middle her she bath mensk small
The word mensk or maint being used instead of very or much. Some
dilferences of opinion have existed among writers as to the origin of the
word corset. Some are of opinion that the French words corps, the
body, and serrer (to tightly inclose or incase), led to the adoption of
the term. Madame La Sante gives it as her opinion, however, that [t i
more probably a corruption of the single word corps, which was whi
written cors, and may be taken as a diminutive for it. Another .
view of thé-Matter has been that the name of a Coser called
corse, which was at one time extensively used in the manufacture of |
corsets, may have been thus corrupted. This is scarcely probable, as
the word corset was in use at too early a-period taadmivof that origin.
Perhaps as ear! instance of the use of the term corset as any in
existence may oon as a portion of an entry in the household register
of Eleanor,“Countess of Leicester, which bears the date May 24, 1265 :—
* A rich description of silk.
