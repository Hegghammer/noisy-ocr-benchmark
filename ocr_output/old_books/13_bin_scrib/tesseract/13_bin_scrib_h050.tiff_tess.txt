32 Seventh Generation.—Joseph I.

He possesses fine social qualities, and, since retiring from business, he °
occasionally amuses himself in hunting and fishing. His integrity,

industry and great business capacities, during the active part of his

life, rendered him a most valuable acquisition to the community in | ax
which he carried on his business, and the articles he mangfactur

were of sterling value to the farming interests of the country.

Mr. Horton, on sending me his photograph for an engraving,
accompanéctxwith the following very modest and unassuming sketch
of his life

“‘T was born in Yorktown, Westchester County, New York, 15
September, 1806. My parents were farmers, in moderate circum-
stances. I remained with them until I was seventeen, working on the
farm in the summer, and going to school in the winter, thus acquiring
merely a common-school education. When I was seventeen years old,
at the MEBEMION OF my parents, I decided to learn the blacksmith
trade, and commenced the business at once, and served an appren-
ticeship for several years. On the 17th of October, 1827, I married |
Phebe Tompkins, and on the 9th of March, 1820, we moved to Peeks-

| kill village, where we have resided ever since. J bought some pro-

perty, and set up the blacksmithing business. I succeeded well in the
business. In the spring of-eéysrbCnterethimen\aice-partutrsirip basi -
ness with Mr. Truman Minor, under the firm name of ‘ Minor & Hor-

Ts and went into the foundry business, manufacturing agricultural
implements, principally ploughs and plough-castings. Our business
increased rapidly, anc paid us well. We continued partners for
twenty years. In 1855 Mr. Minor retired from business, and I took
in Mr. Geo. W. Depeu as a partner, and about two years afterwards,
we admitted each of us a son, and the firm then became, ‘ Horton,
Depeu & Sons.’ Our manufactured articles were sold in nearly every ao
State in the Union, and also in many foreign countries.
—‘iIn 1862 we all sold out to a stock company, formed at pur-
pose. Having been in active business for thirty years, { noy retired.
In the spring of 1855 I was elected Supervisor of the town of Cort-
landt, and I represented that town in the Board of Supervisors for five
years in succession.

“In the winter of 1858, I was a member “of the 1 tgisiature from
this Assembly Péstfict. For many years I held the various offices of
our village, of late have declined official stations, preferring the
enjoyment of p¥ivate life.”

Mr. Horton is not a public professor of Christianity, but is a gen-
tleman of correct moral deportment, and very temperate in his habits.
