I will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and relate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
1796 after ruling over Armenia fifty-eight years. ny

He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his domjniofts,~and
grew to be so mighty in battle that the neighboftipg—pdtions called his
country Aramia and the people were called Argmians, such names as
Armenia or enians being no doubt later corruptions.

The (Fiber of Aram was over Neuchar king of Media, whom he
took prisokerxfid put to death, and made a large part of the country of the
defeated prince tributary to his own. The second victory of Aram was over
Barsham king of Babylon, whom also he took ‘prisoner and put to death.
The next victory was over the king of Cappadocia; the army of the

or assert, but in taking up link by link of whatever knowledge has been left
to us, there scems to be grounds for supposing that the ‘“,Aramzans ”’
designated by foreign writers as “a people of Semitic rac ngflage
religion, coming from Northern Arabia and settling in the (regi etw, /
the western boundaries of Babylonia and the Kc of Western Afia”
were no other than the Hai who under their Ki m had spread their =~
conquests and their kingdom into Mesopotamia even to the shores of
