Note.

The reader will see at a glance the plan of this book. We com- (Y)-

mence with the Christian name, Then follows the parentage, gefiaa
logical “data, &c.> amd then the Christian names of the ite)
order of births. In many of the early families the exact ordéFof
births cannot be ascertained; but it has been approximated as nearly
as possible. The lineage is given in connection with the first member
of the family. The Roman numerals indicate thé Onier-dMasttths—
The sons and daught he old Puritan, Barnahas, constitute the
second generation, they are spoken by way of eminence as Joseph
J., Hannah I., &4 é book contains much repetition, but none
too much to make it plain and easy to study.

This little book contains the chronicles of only about one-half of
the Horton families looked up. Those whose genealogical data are
given only in a small part, and those whose correct lineage has not
been satisfactorily ascertained, are not included in this book.
