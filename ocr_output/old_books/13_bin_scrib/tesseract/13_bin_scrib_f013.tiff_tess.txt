PREFACE ix
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions - 4
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific hig
; torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and cee ye villains, for whom of old no
mud wa thick and slab. Beliefs are being
assailed on every side. Yo abolish the traditional
, courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the considerate
conduct of Captain Hind would, therefore, be
strokes of Ne wnkindest, and I have here attempted
no such iconoclasm. Hven where I cannot be-
lieve, I have told the tale—whenever it has been
| worth the telling—as it is found in criminal
trials, or in Smith op Jolson gnrd phe,
sources, decorously stripped of much vile language.
Tur really, where much that seems incredible
may be fully proned—and where the believable
turns out not rarely to be false, ’tis your only way.
To continue the story of the highwaymen from
Smith and Johnson down to the approaching end ())
of all such things in the beginning of the nime-
teenth century, is like taking up and conciliy)
a half-told tale. But tt was worth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpin has
always made, has it been found really necessary
to seriously fonder and re-state the career of
that much-overrated scoundrel, and to put him
in his proper place: a very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
