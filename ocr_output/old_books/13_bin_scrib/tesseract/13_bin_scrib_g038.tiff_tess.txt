52 HISTORICAL SKETCHES OF 4
“‘square fort with bastions’”’ at what is now
cafe Bprrances, which he named San Carlos.
As eginning, or rather reconstruction of a
town named Pensacola, he erected some houses
adjacent to the fort. And there, too, was built
a church, historically the first ever erected on
“ME SHores of Pensacola Bay, but presumptively
the second; for it is hardly credible that the
' large settlement of de Luna, embracing so many i
| ecclesiastics, should have failed to observe the |
universal custom of the Spaniards ta build a
church wherever they planted a colony. Irre-
Ti sistible, therefore, is the inference that the first
notes of a church-bell heard within the limits of ‘
the United States were those which rolled over
the waters of Pensacola Bay and the white
hills of Santa Rosa from 1559 to 1562. ()
Having demonstrated that the settlemept of <
~~ de Evma was the original Pensacola, vor
Arriola was apparently the second, though
actually but a resuscitation of the colony of
1559; for the name, the people, 'thotipit not the
same stration, and the place being one, mere
lapsé oftime should not be permitted to destroy .
