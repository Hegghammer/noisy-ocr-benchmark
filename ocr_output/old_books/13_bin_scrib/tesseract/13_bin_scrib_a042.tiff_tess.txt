Blow followed bluw. Hardly had the remnant of the AYigepigt Teople escaped from
massaere when their Church fell under the bratal domination tussia. Plehve ordained its
destruction, a solitzin was sent to Tiflis as governor-general to carry it out. Church
property to Migathie of £6,000,000 was seized by violence, the Natholikos resolutely refusing
to give up fhe keyyof the safe where the title deeds were kept (June, 1903). For two years
the Russiakothpéils played with the revenues, retaining cighty per cent. for their own
advantage. But in the mean time assassination had rid the earth of Plehve, and the over-
wheliming defeats of Russia in Manchuria were attributed to the Armenian curse. Gradgingly
the Church property was restored, in utter chaos, and for the moment it is Russia’s policy to
favor the Armenians as a balance against the Georgians, whom the St. Petersburg government

future he was not hopeful. Ile no longer even eontemplated an autonomous Armenid, {ther
on ‘Turkish territory or on Russian. On the Russian side of the frontier the Aknfenian

the race to form any kind of community. Indeed, for the last twelve years the Armenian
villagers have been crawling over the foot of A A rat by thousands gysar to escape the Kurds,
and every morning they come and stand in fresh groups Of pink and blue rags outside the
Monastery door where the head of their Church and race lies dying. They stand there in
mute appeal, as I suw them, possessing nothing in the world but the variegated tatters

t cover them, and their faith in their Katholikos. Slowly they ure drafted away into
Tiflis, Baku, or their Caucasign villages, but nowhere are they welcomed.

Some of the bishops and monks, who form a council round their chief, still look for
Europe's interference, and trust that the solemn pledges taken by England and other Powers

Whatever may be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for

there is, ¥ think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
