The efforts of the Armenians, and the entreaties of their Patriarch
Nerses had procured the insertion of Article 16 in the Treaty of San
Stefano signed between Russia and Turkey in March 1878. In ee
wording of the Article had been suggested by the Pavia, ite I
provided the following stipulation for the protectiog of th enians :—

‘ As the evacuation by the Russian troops ne territory which they
now occupy-m Armenia, and which is to be restored to Turkey, might give
rise to 6: and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good
relation betyeen the two countries, the Sublime Porte engages to carry into
effect without further delay the improvements and reforms demanded by
local requirements in the provinces inhabited by the Armenians, and to
guarantee their security against the Kurds and Circassians.”

What followed has passed into history. The British Government of
whielnLecd Beaconsfield (then Mr. D’Israeli) was Premier, and Lord Salis-
bury Foreign Secretary, once more pursued the old policy of baffling Rugsian
agerandizement in Turkey. Afraid that her own real or fancied dees
would thereby become imperilled, England threw in the weight of he\power,

| and virtually commanded the substitution of the Treaty of Berlin in lieu of
the Treaty of San Stefano. Thus the substantial guarantee of a natural and
immediate protector, bottlable anddasireumof caloxcingtbe protection which
the Armenians then had in Russia, was taken away, and the security of im-
Sse words given in its stead, namely :—

“The Sublime Porte undertakes to carry out without further delay the
improvements ané-reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces
inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the
Circassians and Kurds. It will periodically make known thg-steps taken to
this effect to the Powers, who will superintend their applicafign.”)

“Tt will periodically make knowin the steps taken by Pepe, /
Powers, who will superintend their applicatietZ~ How this last groyise’ |
could furftsh food for laughter were it not for Opti tragedy involved
in it.

The insertion of Article 61 in the Treaty of Berlin, granted, or rater
seemingly granted, by the six Powers of Europe, proved in reality, as fub-
sequent evenfs bore out, an instrument ot cesth aNd torture. It wes Bs if
the sede figures had reversed the possibilities of succoky|and
protection/Abd with the death of the Czar Liberator, the last chance of the
Armeniafs diéd.

The Turkish Massacres of 1875 and 1876 which led up to the Russo-
Turkish War of 1877 are historical facts too well known to need further
