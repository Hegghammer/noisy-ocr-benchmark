Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish nypire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this super-added eure 0
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, gseater ers and
depredators than the Turks, the regular cctpation Ga ves comprises
murder and robbery, and who have through weary ¢enturies unremittinzly
quartered t ves upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits df gery and toil. Indeed as the Hamidieh cavalry which
was establi expressly for the Hamidian massacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized murder, can now find for those habits in
which they were encouraged and trained to indulge by the Hamidian
régime,

Under all such conditions no hope of better days can be forthcoming
no prospect of better times seems possible, for that unhappy portion ffs
Armenian race whom force of circumstances keeps on the soil ol/the

| fatherland.

The appointment of Christian governors over the provinces  in-
habited by them might ameloretesamc ofthe crils-octheather alternative,

allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespective of creed or

Prascess would furnish some means of self-defence against the raids

barbarities of the oppressors ; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christian_peasaat subject to Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his enemies, must remain one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Not the most fertile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the n siduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, Li othe
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of thdt tomf /
happiness, and security of life and property, Gi law of all civihzed -
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer ahd tHler of the soil.
