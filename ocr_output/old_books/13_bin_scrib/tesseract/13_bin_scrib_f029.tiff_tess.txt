There is plentiful evidence that when Captain
Alexander Smith in 1719-20 wrote and published
his work upon the highwaymen and other evil-

they will repay the trouble is quite another
matter. He includes {x Wie wANORy ovom Tobin
C / Hood and Sir John Falstaff; and, not concerned
point out their legendary or merely literary
character, gives ax- exact (though necessarily not
a truthful) biography of each.
Several editions of Smith exist; some in three,
others in two volumes. The title-pages vary (Y)
largely, but all are extremely lengthy, and_so ‘
cavious that it is well worth while to repr
one as on the next page.

heart’s cofe ‘ef him, he expends his most loving
labours upon the freebooters who displayed his
own political bias, and there can be little doubt
