walking in the angle formed by the floor
and the side walls of the staterooms rather

companion-way, the same thatTcame downer

Going along the passage (on deck B) I
T sootea down some of the cross passages that
lead to the staterooms;and at the bottom of
the ones I passed I saw that the portholes
were open and that the water could not have
been more than a few feet from them. Here
let me state that I consider it most extraor-

dinary that the portholes on the lower decks O
should not have been closed and sealed as we
steamed through the war zone. At luncheon

the portholes in the dining-saloon on deck
D were OE and so I doubt not that
all the dthers on that deck were open.
