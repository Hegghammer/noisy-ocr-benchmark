viii PREFACE
. from Smith, who himself was prone to include - pe
the most extravagant myths in his pages, ca
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE TIstorY ee
THE ey Actions oF THE Most Famous
Hieuwkyuen. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the “truth” of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better. :
No one has ever reprinted those authors in
themertginnt extravagance, or their grossness.
It would be impossible ; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
| them, or even written an independent history of
the highwaymen. When we consider how astonish: _
ingly popular those romances have ever been
Twit have had Claude Du Vall, and Turpin,
and their like for heroes, this is not a little
surprising.
Perhaps the task has been abandoned because
of the difficulty—the almost insuperable difficulty (Y)
—of sifting fact from fiction, and because a ‘
chilling ~sense that it would be a thntad
to present the highwayman as he really was: a
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No Hovétist—tontd
be likely to fin the frank historian for this dis-
service ; Ain do not think the historian who came
to the subject im this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
