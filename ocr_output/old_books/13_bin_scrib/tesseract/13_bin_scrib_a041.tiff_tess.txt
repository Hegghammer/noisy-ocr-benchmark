like a round bow, a great brown cye revealed the inward spirit’s intelligence and zeal un-
quenched. On his head was a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.

Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century’s greatest men—Magzditel
Kxhrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian peop] sion
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Ntchmiatzin, or “ Th Begotten
is Descended.” From the window of a neighboring room he flight—b ooked across the
frost hound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now aJitut close and huried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling suow’ and hurricane that hid the
conc of Arargf nd just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of that4ake) eighty-seven years ago, Khrimian was born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was\still yidiminished by sea or land ; the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able Powers furope. It was four years before Byron sct out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom—a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Near Kast. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos now looked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to Inst it had been inspired by one absorbing and unselfish aim—the freedom and
regencration of his people, It is trac he had failed.

From his earliest years, when he had witnessed the terrors of Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round .Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality—sugh a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance ambpnf the
prosperous and contented of the world. Ie began as a poet, wandering far and wide tWrough

| the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wife’s death, he devoted himself to the building of schouls,
which he generously threw of@rt do tttnest Mey sets CFA atienians. For many
ars, While Europe was occupied with Crimean wars, Austrian wars, or French and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying from Van to Constantinople and through the
itics of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emblems of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When electedtTnfénian patriarch of Constantinople (1869), he was driven from

his office after four years.

But the cup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiless slaughter of-Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. W7Ah/varfed motises

Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises ff
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in cheek aid

So it wht de Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake:
