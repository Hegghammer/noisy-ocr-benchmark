THE ZONE
Avert Thy gaze, O God, close tight Thine eyes!
Glance down no longer on the ocean foam,
Lest Thou behold such horrors as can turn
Men's burning hearts to ice, and chill their souls.
Keep Thine heart warm and full of charity
That Thou mayst yet be able to ive,
And pity feel for those who know
hen
To
pause
in deeds of ruthless sad
Restrain Thy wrath, and keep
check;
Smite not, nor fiercely thrust wi
Those who can dare to strew the
With fellow creatures, innocent
Forget the studied purpose
The launching of the mis
the deep;
The shattered hull; the ed and bleeding forms;
The seething swirl of wreckage, women, men.
