narrative of the siege of Port Arthur ter being read through the length

or carries the reader through appalling
scenes of horr
read we are made to realize the slaughter of
the enemy's m
of their ground-mines, electric-wire entangle-
ments, and expl
s; we are made to hear the roar of the artillery
fire dealing deat destruction, and there rises before us the mental vision
of the fierce han to hand conflict, and the dead and dying lying thickly in
the dark ravine.
For hill and battle plain,
With dying men and slain,
Grew mountain heights of pain,
And mine is boundless woe.'

in the world gives expression to his feelings on his own great achievement,
in saddest words.
"And mine is boundless woe,"
For the grim warrior's heart is cleft in twain for the human bullets that
under his command hurled themselves to their death.
