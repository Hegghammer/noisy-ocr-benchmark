CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

and carnivorous habits. They walk on their toes: yet not so much from that habitual stealthiness

suited to nocturnal,
and hence the Lion rarely hunts his prey while the sun
is above the hori

The Tiger, on
will seek his prey by day as well as by night; and during twilight the
colour of his at of a blue-green flame. If a stranger passes near a Tiger in a menagerie,
the colour nimal's eyes will sometimes alter suddenly, from yellow-green to blue-green ;
alteration in the degree of light acting upon them, but from mental excitement, and
from certain natural facility of expansion and contraction of the eye-pupils.
Hence a characteristic difference between the Lion and the Tiger. The habits of the latter
are diurnal, and he disregards night-fires: the Lion, on the contrary, whose eyes are not calculated
for the glare of day, cannot bear to encounter fire-light at night. Yet these physical conforma-
tions are sometimes overcome by the rage of hunger; and hence, in MR. EDWIN LANDSEER's
contending group, the Lion is represented as attacking the Tiger although it be day.
MR. BELL treats learnedly, and we believe with much originality, of the facial-muscles of
this class of quadrupeds, in his "Anatomy of Expression."We shall offer a few extracts, by
which the reader will perceive how limited are their powers of expression of countenance, when
compared with those of human nature, notwithstanding their superiority over all other quadrupeds.
"The violent passions mark themselves so distinctly on the countenances both of men and
of animals, that we are apt in the first instance to consider the movements by which they are
indicated, as certain signs or characters provided by Nature, for the express purpose of intimating
the internal emotion; and to suppose that they are interpreted by the observer in consequence of a
peculiar and instinctive faculty. This view of things, however, so natural at first sight, is not
altogether satisfactory to philosophy; and a more jealous observation of the facts, seems to suggest
not from
