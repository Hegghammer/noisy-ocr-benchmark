During a period extending over thirty years the civilized world has
heard of Turkish Massacres of Armenians. Massacres of a nature so
ferocious and abolical, so hideous and revolting, that no pen could adequate-
ly describe the horrors
Writing in 96, Mr. James Bryce, in his supplementary chapter to the

generations of men once more began to people the earth.
Once the land of Ararat was an independent kingdom until the tide of
victory rolled over it and conquered its independence. Hemmed round by
