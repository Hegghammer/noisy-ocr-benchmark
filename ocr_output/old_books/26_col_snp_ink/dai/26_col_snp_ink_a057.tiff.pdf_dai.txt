thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the feared fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history,

Meanwhile a peremptory order reached him, signed by the tan, to recall the Armenian
delegation from Berlin. This Monseigneur Varjabétian po lank refused to do, and retired

The Sultan and his advisers never forgave the Patriare his, though they could not

all appearance the incident was forgotten, but it was not so. On summer afternoon a most
cordial invitation was sent by a very high dignitary of the Palace, questing the Arehbishop
to dine with him informally. An invitation of this kind could no very well be refused, so
the Archbishop, accompanied only by a body-servant named Vartan, epaired to the l'asha's

Archbishop might have had as to his personal safety.
After dinner, as usual, coffee was served. Now, this serving of the coffee is rather a
ceremonial according to high Turkish etiquette, and it is not unusal for guests to bring their
own tehooboukdar (the servant who carries his master's pipe and pouch and also superintends

heavy curtains over the doorway were thrown apart, revealing the ghastly pale face of his
servant Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, in a voice trembling with emotion, "Monseigneur,

This was enough for the Archbishop; he pretended to he startled and spilt the coffee, but,
alas! he had already drunk a small quantity of it. Meanwhile a scuflle was going on behind
the portière, where his poor servant Vartan was paying the penalty of his devotion to his
master. Concerning Vartan's whereabouts or his ultimate end nothing was ever made public

the Pusha for his generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily summoned. The Patriarch took to his bed,
and lost all his hair through the effects of the poison. Then, one morning, when a servant
