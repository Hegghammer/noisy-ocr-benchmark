from Smith, who himself was prone to include
the most extravagant myths in his pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE LIVES AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAMOUS
HIGHWAYMEN. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the truth" of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.
No one has ever reprinted those authors in
their original extravagance, or their grossness
It would be impossible; and, if possible, it woy
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever e ed
them, or even written an independent his of
the highwaymen. When we consider how onish-

Perhaps the task has been
of the difficulty-the almos
of sifting fact from f
chilling sense that it

fellow rarely hero

No novelist would
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dis-
service ; and I do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
