passage from
Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have clung to their christian faith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure.
The cathedral of Etchmiatzin built by Gregory still stands to-day; it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, un perhaps
little of the original building may be left, but it still claims to the church
built by the patron saint of Armenia. I shall here quote
"Historical Sketch of the Armenian Church," written an Armenian.
priest :
"Owing to political circumstances the Arm l'atriarchate had at
times to be transferred to metropolises and her principal towns of
Armenia. In the year A.D. 452 it was re to Dwin, in 993 to Ani,
in 1114 to RÃ´mklah, and in 1294 to Sis. Kingdom of Cilicia becoming
extinct, and, we having no more a kin
no longer a capital town, it
was natural and proper to re-trang
to its own original place, as
the entire nation unanimously de it. ordingly, in the year 1441, it
was decided by an ecclesiasticaeeting that seat of the Catholicus should
return to Holy Etchmiat, where to this day has been preserved the
proper unbroken succession from our Apostes and from our holy Father,
St. Gregory the Illuminator."
I read the other day in one of the forein papers published in Japan,
the following piece of news :
"An Armenian Church pronounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christian era, has been discovered in a fair state of preserva-
tion in the neighbourhood of Bash-Aparnah.
Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light on Armenian history.
