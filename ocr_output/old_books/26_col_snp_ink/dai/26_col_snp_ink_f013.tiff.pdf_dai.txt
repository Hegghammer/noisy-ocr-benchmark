PREFACE

Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific his-
torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and exalted the villains, for whom of old no
mud was too thick and slab. Beliefs are being
assailed on every side. To abolish the traditional
courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the
conduct of Captain Hind
be
strokes of the unkindest, a
ed
no such iconoclasm. Even
e-
lieve, I have told the tale-
worth the telling as it is to
mal
trials, or in Smith or Johnson,
old
sources, decorously stripped of much
age.
For really, where much that seen
lible
may be fully proved, and where
cable
turns out not rarely to be false, 'tis
way.
To continue the story of the high from
Smith and Johnson down to the app
of all such things in the beginning
nine-
teenth century, is like taking up and luding
a half-told tale. But it was worth doing.
Only in respect of the great figure pin has
always made, has it been found reali ecessary
to seriously consider and re-state the ureer of
that much-overrated scoundrel, and
in his proper place: a very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
