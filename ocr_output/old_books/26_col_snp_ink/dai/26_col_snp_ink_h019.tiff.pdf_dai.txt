and genealogy of the early settlers of Southold-examining all the deeds and wills,
and other authentic documents to be found, and also copying the inscriptions from
every headstone, not only in Southold, but over nearly the whole Island-makes it
very evident that some of those named were not there at so early a date, and he
also says that Peter Hallock, who is named as one of the thirteen, was the grandson
of the Puritan Hallock who settled at Southold, and whose Christian name was

to Long Island, he is the best authority extant.
MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE.

It will be seen by the engraving that the old house is double. The
western part is that which was built by Barnabas in 1659-60. The
east or two-story part was built by Jonathan I., about 1682. The upper
room of this part was used for a cour house for nearly twenty years,
as we learn from Thompson's History Long Island, and some of
the old benches used when it was a house are still preserved.
The old castle," as Jonathan G. H

I know of no dwelling-house of any
or brick, now stand-

mansion. There
were a few huts on the east of Long
to 1640-two or
three it is said on Shelter Island. B

two generations of the same name, living and dying in the same now

bearing the Horton name, living and dying in the same house, and
all born in it except Barnabas I., and his son Jonathan. We may go
to the castles and palaces of the old world, and search long and dili-
gently, and fail to find a parallel case.
With a few repairs, the old castle may yet stand for generations far
in the future.
It requires some thought and reflection to realize the lapse of time
since the old house was built. See the old Puritan himself there
twenty years; then his son Jonathan, twenty-eight years; and then
Jonathan, Jr., about sixty years; and next Lawrence and his son Jona-
