THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
I mean those in the staterooms. I cannot
speak with certainty in regard to the port-
holes on deck E. I believe that the first list
the ship took brought her down to these
open ports on the starboard side and that
she sank much more quickly from filling
through them.
On my return to the deck I felt that the
steamer must make her final plunge any mo-
ment now, and as there was nothing more that
could be done on the port side-for there was
no discipline or order with which to do it-I
passed through to the starboard side. Men
were striving to lower the boats and were
putting women and children into them, but it
seemed to me that it only added horror to
the whole situation to put people into a
boat that you knew never would be eared
and which would go down with
better leave them on the de
take their chance at a pie
