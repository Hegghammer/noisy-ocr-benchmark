PREFACE INTRODUCTION.
We give BARNABAS HORTON as the Preface and Introduction to this
little volume of Chronicles. He was probably the son of Joseph
Horton, of Leicestershire, England, and born in the little hamlet of
Mousely of that shire. Of his hory before he came to America very
little is known. He came ove he ship "Swallow," in 1633-38.
He landed at Hampton, Mass long he remained at Hampton
is not known. But in 1640
m with his wife and two chil-
dren in New Haven, Conn..
with the Rev. John Youngs
William Welles, Esq., Pete
Tuthill, Richard Ter
Thomas Mapes, Matthias
erly, Jacob Corey
Conklin, Isaac Arnold,
Oct., 1640, assisted by t
Eaton, they organized
sailed to the east end
been members of Purnan
in England, and I had families
with them except Peter Hallock. They doubtless had been on the
island previous to this time and looked out their homes. On nearing
the shore they cast lots to decide who should first set foot on the land.
The lot fell on Peter Hallock, and the place where he stepped upon
the land has ever since been known as Hallock's Landing.
On coming ashore, they all knelt down and engaged in prayer,
Peter Hallock leading, as had been determined by the lot. These
were the first persons of any civilized nation that had ever attempted
to settle on the east end of Long Island. See Griffin's Journal.
Barnabas Horton was a man of deep-toned piety, and a warm advo-
cate of civil and religious freedom. He was one of the most promi-
nent and influential men of Southold. He was for many years a
magistrate, and several times a member of the General Court at New
Haven and Harford. He built the first framed dwelling-house ever
erected on the east of Long Island, and that house is still (1875)
standing and occupied. It is a shingle-house, that is, shingles are
used for weather-boards, and the sides have never been reshingled,
and the roof but once, according to the statement of Jonathan Gold-
smith Horton, the last Horton occupant of the old house.
