FOREWORD
Woodworking shops in manual training schools far outnumber
those for other manual activities, and as a result, courses in wood-
work have come to be termed the stable courses in a handwork
curriculum. However, experience in woodwork alone is not suf-
ficient, and needs to be supplemented by other and more varied
activities to give to the boy a proper foundation for choice of
vocation.
A definite way to produce necessary variety as applied to wood-
work, especially if woodwork is the only course offered, is thru the
use of such mediums as cane, reed, rush, splints and allied materials
in correlation with the wood. These materials add life to the
problems and generally arouse interest and enthusiasm in the work
at hand. The result is careful application to construction details,
with resultant appreciation of constructive design.
It would prove a difficult task to make a fair estimate of the
value such mediums have in manual training shops. Their use
produces very definite reactions upon boys who could not be reached
by woodwork alone, awakening them to a new interest in the
work and making them more workmanlike and exacting in
struction.
There exists some element in such mediums which c
defined, but which nevertheless stimulates the average
boy, as well as the exceptional one, to produce the
which he is capable. Experience with these ma
correlation with wood will prove the truth of
demonstrate that they are not only worth
any well-rounded course in wood.
