4 hours. Remove it from the tub and wash thoroly in running
water. The best way to do this is to lay the reed on an inclined
surface and turn a forceful stream of water upon it. Chloride of
lime has a bad effect upon the hands in that it makes them sore and
tender, so care must be taken to properly rinse the reed. A little
tallow rubbed over the hands will materially offset the tendency to
tenderness, and generally keep them in good condition.
Staining.-Bleached reed takes stain much more readily and
evenly than does the natural or unbleached. It may be stained any
color with prepared stains, but ordinarily these leave the reed
muddy in appearance due primarily to the difficulty in brushing in
or wiping off the stain in the recesses which weaving leaves. Per-
haps the best agent for coloring reed, and at least a very desirable
one, especially after it has been woven, is naptha. The preparation
of the stain and the process of coloring is as follows: Obtain the
necessary amount and variety of colors ground in oil; mix the re-
quired colors with a little naptha; ther to determine the shade of
color test with a reed. Reed absorbs given amount of color,
therefore the shade will prove out prac the same when tested
with a small quantity of naptha, as w

amount. Add the required amount of
the solution, avoid-
ing thinning too much; otherwise the
