Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt; this super-added evil, is, the
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, greater marauders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation of whose lives comprises
murder and robbery, and who have through weary centuries unremittingly
quartered themselves upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits of their labour and toil. Indeed as the Hamidieh cavalry which
was established expressly for the Hamidian massacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized murder, can now find for those habits in
which they were encouraged and trained to indulge by the Hamidian
r√©gime.
Under all such conditions no hope of better can be forthcoming,
no prospect of better times seems possible, for nhappy portion of the
Armenian race whom force of circumsta

fatherland.
