CANING SUGGESTIONS

TO COVER CANE ENDS.
holes are bored and utilized in the cane weaving. These are not
absolutely necessary; in fact caned areas on many pieces of period
and modern furniture do not utilize corner holes. In such instances
two diagonal strands are run in each hole on either side of the
A comparison of the areas, the one employing a corner
hole, and the other not, will lead the observer to conclude that the
former appears complete while the latter appears unfinished.
It is frequently necessary or desirable
to cover up the cane on the back or inside
of an article. This is true of places ex-

in a school shop, is hand caned, and of mahogany. The exposed
cane is covered with strips of mahogany 1/4 in. thick and 1 in. wide
in which a groove in. deep and 3 in. wide has been run. This
groove may be made with saw, chisel, or combination plane. Fig. 8
shows a sketch of such a strip. It makes a neat, pleasing cover.
Many pieces of so-called expensive furniture have ragged, exposed
caning. This is unsightly and is not to be commended.

will not permanently color cane. Oil stains make no appreciable
impression if rubbed off at once. But water, acid, and alcoh
stains produce decided colors. If the worker desires to color
cane approximately the same shade as the article, the cani
