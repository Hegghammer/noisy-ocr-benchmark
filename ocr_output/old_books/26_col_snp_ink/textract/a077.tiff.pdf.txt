I will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and relate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
1796 alter ruling over Armenia fifty-eight years.
He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his dominions, and
grew
to be so mighty in battle that the neighbouring nations called his
country ramia and the people were called Aramians, such names as
Armenia O Armenians being no doubt later corruptions.
The
fi
t
victory
of
Aram
was
over
Neuchar
king
of
Media,
whom
he
took prison and put to death, and made a large part of the country of the
defeated prit tributary to his own. The second victory of Aram was over
Barsham kin f Babylon, whom also he took prisoner and put to death.
The next vil
y
was over the king of Cappadocia ; the army of the
Cappadocians
pursued to the very shores of the Mediterranean, and the
whole of Capp
a
fell into the hands of Aram B.C. 1 796. Also Ninus
king of Assyria
ne time an eager eneny, awed by the victories of Aram,
sought to cultiv
friendship.
No doubt if
umes and scripts of paper or parchment of the famous
Alexandrian libra
h burned for six months as fuel in the four thousand
baths of the city,
ed that n
ócious act of vandalismi, and been
preserved instead
ure
wledge now lost to us concerning
the ancient kingdo
ight be known in our day ; and also
when the tide of I
over the kingdom of Armenia, how
much of the story
e people was lost and destroyed along
with the destruction
dence it would be difficult now to calculate
or assert, but in tak
link of whatever knowledge has been left
to us, there scems
ands for supposing that the "Arameans"
designated by foreigi
as " people of Semitic race language and
religion, coming fron
tern Arabia and settling in the region between
the western boundarie
Babylonia and the highlands of Western Asia
were no other than th Hai who under their King Aram had spread their
conquests
and
their
kugdom
into
Mesopotamia
and
even
to
the
shores
of
the Mediterranean.
Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when he includes
Northern Mesopotamia, together with the mountainous country of Ararat,
under the name of Armenia, and in writing of the Armenían boats that
brought
merchandise
to
Babylon,
he
remarks
that
they
were
constructed
in
Armenia, in the parts above Assy'tia.
Archaeological researches have laid the clain that the modern Armenians
are the descendants of the old Hittites ; the modern Armenian being supposed
