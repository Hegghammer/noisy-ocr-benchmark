PREFACE.
VII
writing in praise of the moderate use of Corsets take their facts,
experiences, and grounds of argument from the every-day life and
general custom of the present period.
The Crinoline is too closely associated with the Corset and with the
mutable modes affected by ladies, from season to season, to be omitted
from any volume which treats of Fashion. The same facts, indeed, may be
stated of both the Crinoline and the Corset. Both appeat to be equally
indispensable to the woman of the present period.
lo make them
serve the purposes of increased cleanliness, comfort,
grace, not only
without injury to the health, but with positive and
tted advantage
to the pbysique-these are the problems to be
by those whose
business it is to minister to the ever-changin
and fashion of
the day.
