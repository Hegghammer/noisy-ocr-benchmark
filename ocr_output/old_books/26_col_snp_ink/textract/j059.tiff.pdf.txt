ter I. These reeds should not be confused with the term reed
applied to several distinct species of large water loving
Such reeds are usually designated under the name of grasses. grasses, There
are a thousand species of palm distributed over the tropical regions
of the entire world, but only a few are native in the United States,
and these are of no distinct commercial value. The rattan or cane
palms of India and the Malay Islands grow to an unusual height,
and are imported into this country in great quantities. These rat-
tans and the trailing palm of the species Calamus have as main
export centers Singapore and Calcutta. These palms are stripped
of leaves and bark and split into round and flat strips of different
diameters and widths. The outer bark, when stripped into proper
sizes, is known as cha cane; the entire palm, with leaves removed,
is
commercially know rattan ; and the flat reeds are frequently
sold as flat rattan and
ne. Inasmuch as these flat and round
strips, split from the
and exported under the name of
rattan are called reed
