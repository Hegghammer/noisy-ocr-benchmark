That the Armenians should be constantly appealing to the Power that
had
pledged itself for their protection, and that the same Power should be
constantly rallying the others, and making Ambassadorial demonstrations,
was enough to rouse the vilest passions of a nature in which no feelings
except vile passions existed.
Of all sins in this wor
perhaps the sin of foolishness receives the
severest punishment, 2,N,
all crimes, the crime of failure meets with the
heaviest doom. For
t
bolishness in trusting in European protection
and hoping for Europ
rvention the unfortunate Armenians paid with
rivers of their own
nd for their crime of failure they were made to
wallow in that blood.
arkest pages of their history have been written
in the closing years ON
neteenth, and the early years of the twentieth
century ; never since t
S of their independence, nine centuries ago, had
they hoped for so much,
ver had they paid so dearly for their follv.
If they had carefully
eart the whole history of Europe's inter-
course with Asia, beginnin
ronquests of the Macedonian Alexander;
they would have read in th
ber judgement, self-interest, and self-
interest only written on ev
age, but they committed the folly of
GENERAL TER GOUKASSOFF.
Relieved the beleaguered Russian garrison
at Bayazid during the Russo-Tarkish war of
1877, captured the fortress ; and otherwise
distinguished himself during the war.
The other Armenian General who dis-
in
in
tinguished himself during the Russo-Turkishi
war was General Lazaroff'.
