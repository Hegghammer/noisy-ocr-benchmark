On the field the ever victorious anny of little Japan undernuned Russia's
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
deleated and ever retreating army of colossal Russia. At sea the ever
victorious Japanese Fleet succeeded in completely annibilating the Russian
Fleet. It was war such as
world had never yet seen. The secret of
such astounding successes sh
investigated, and here I beg leave to
quote from one of a series
in which I gave view to my opinions
during the Russo-Tapanese
may be likened to the bundle of
faggots in the fable firmly
rot of larger dimensions in
the centre, the sovereion
nation clusters, and all,
ruler and people tied tos
patriotism.
These remarks of
of actual facts. In
national unity Japan stand
Id ; she furnishes
an example which the world
on so politically
forlorn as ourselves more than
to
From the astounding success
1et us turn
position the
Great Republic of the United States
Xmerica occupies
world, and
take the lesson to heart of what Union can accomplish as
intrast their
present position with the position that the handful of puritan pill
S occupied
when they first landed on American soil not quite three hundre
ars ago.
National Unity is our greatest need it is the banner which
ve
must
raise up over our national life. National Unity must be engraven n the
tablets of our minds and throb in the pulses of our hearts. There are
mountains of difficulties before us, and if ever we must reach the goal we
can only do so by being bound together like the bundle of faggots in the
fable, with no weakening or loosening of the bands. Then perhaps we
might once more be able to get an independent footing on the historical soil
of our fathers, and perhaps once more rally round our own flag. A Japan-
ese lives for the State, not for himself; we have no State for which to live,
but let us live for our communities whilst we keep the hope in our hearts
that communities grow into States.
We have grit and endurance in an unparalleled degree, but these
characteristics will profit us nothing it we are wanting in unity.
Let us remember that utterance of the Founder of our faith. In our
loyalty and allegiance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents of a
cataract, but we must remember His warning utterance -
"What shall it profit a man." What shall it profit a nation. Unity is
the soul of a nation. Let us keep our soul and not lose it.
