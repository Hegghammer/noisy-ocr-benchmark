THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND CIVILIZED
EUROPE.
"Hear then ye Senates ! hear this truth sublime,
They who allow Oppression share the crime."
" A voice was heard in Ran ah, lamentation, and bitter weeping ; Rahel
weeping for her children refused O be comforted for her children, because
they were not."
In the twentieth century o
hristian era, in the age of trumpeted
progress, of boasted and vaunte
zation, there is a Ramah of countries,
a desolated Ramah, blackened
bed with the fires of oppression, and

savage sweep of the barbarians of the north, and the unbridled tyrannies of
despotic power, from all which she loudly boasts to have emancipated herself,
and like the evolution according to the Darwinian theory of the anthro-
pomorphal ape, to have progressed into the state of civilization. But
beginning from the last quarter of the nineteenth and on into the first decade
of the twentieth century, the horrors of the darkest ages in human history
have lain at her doors, and towards these horrors Europe has kept up the
role of an extenuatingly disclaiming, a mildly rebuking sweetly frowning,
smilingly denouncing, Disapprover.
Half a million Armenians annibilated by organized massacres of the
most ferocious and hideous natures, and perhaps a corresponding number
