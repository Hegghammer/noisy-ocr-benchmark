CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
the scene of which, by the way, he has not represented as a royal menagerie, but as a wild,
rocky cavern-his animals partake of the artificial character of which we cannot bring ourselves to
approve.
Of this fact, however, we purpose to exhibit proof with our assertion. Improved versions, to
the best abilities of our Artists, of some of these Lions of RUBENS and the Assyrian king, will here
be introduced, which the reader, who pleases, may compare with the originals. Our second, third,
and fourth Plates are of the number.

However such d'

Virtues, might be ra
unsuitable in lis den, or within the prechucts of those wild haunts, where he
is accustomed to in his natural state. We have often read of the fabled Men-bulls, or (Mino-
taurs,) and we find such on the coinage of Crete. These allegrorical creatures of RUBENS, which,
alas ! have sometimes been quoted by Artists without half his greuius, and placed in sayage con-
flicts, or beside their Britannias-are a species of Men-lions. Placed among the Sabwan sculp-
tures, they might pass for incarnations of Sol in Leo ; but would very ill pass for Leo alone.
Among the observers of this poetic improvement, or this natural and unpoetical deficieucy, on
the part of RUBENS, TITIAN, JULIO ROMANO, and other painters, both ancient and modern: and
of the consequent desideratum on the part of the public, of a cabinet or library collection of the
nobler wild animals in a state of Nature, so as to auswer the purposes of reference, while they con-
duced to the pleasures of Taste, were Mr. EDGAR SPILSBURY and Mr. THOMAS LANDSEER.
Whether or not the public "looked up to them for light" on that subject, (to use the language of
STERNE,) they thought the Public "deserved it;" and they therefore, as the best practical means
of eliciting that light, first copied the general forms and attitudes of most of the wild aninials that
appear in this book, from the old masters-geuerally speaking, from works that are well known
-and then, went to Nature and corrected the details. They carried with them what, in those
ancient masters, was meritorious in composition, attitude and chiaroscuro, and brought
detail. to the best of their ability-superadding it to, and blending it with, the above-accuracy away, of
