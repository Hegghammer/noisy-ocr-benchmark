Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have clung to their christian faith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure.
The cathedral of Etchmiatzin built by Gregory still stands to-day it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, un't perhaps
little of the original building may be left, but it still claims to b the church
built by the patron saint of Armenia. I shall here quote passage from
"Historical Sketch of the Armenian Church," writter y an Armenian
priest :
"Owing to political circumstances the Arn
l'atriarchate had at
times to be transferred to metropolises and
ther principal towns of
Armenia. In the year A.D. 452 it was ro
a to Dwin, in 993 to Ani,
in I 114 to Rômklah, and in 1294 to Sis.
Lingdom of Cilicia becoming
extinct, and, we having no more a kinn
I no longer a capital town, it
was natural and proper to re-trans
the
to its own original place, as
the entire nation unanimously de
ordingly, in the year 1441, it
was decided by an ecclesiastica reeting that 1 E seat of the Catholicus should
return to Holy where to this day has been preserved the
proper unbroken succession from our Apost es and from cur holy Father,
St. Gregory the Illuminator.''
I read the other day in one of the forei in papers published in Japan,
the following piece of news :
"An Armenian Church pronounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christian era, has been discovered in a fair state of preserva-
tion in the neighbourhood of Bash-Aparnah.
Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light on Armenian history.
