Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
Turkish rule ? To this question, we must answer an emphatic No !
The causes that must operate against any change are many and deep-
seated. In the first place it cannot be expected that a few Turks of liberal
ideas (or it may be French polished) at Constantinople, are going to change
the thought and character of the nation. The characteristics of a people
change very slowly, if they ever change at all, and the predominant national
traits of the many-blooded modern Turk have been shown to the world to
be, cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a fierce sensuality ; and what
is
more than all, and which has to be remembered most, is, that they are a
people accustomed to the unbridled gratification of their worst passions.
The ethnographic traits of the Turkman which history bears out, are
wildness and fierceness, and it would not be incorrect to argue that with the
instincts
O
his primitive ancestors have been assimilated the many cross
currents
ti
run in his veins, into all of which has been infused the
doctrines of
religion of the sword, a religion which does not make for
the peace or
being of mankind; a religion, also, which assigning one of
the two sexes
legraded position of being created solely for the gross
pleasure of the
bes not make for the exaltation of mankind.
To quote
eminent authority previously referred to : " No
Mahommedan ra
y has ever shown itself able to govern well
even subjects of
n, while to extend equal rights to subjects of
a different creed is
be very law of its being."
Not the Jewish
ng itself God's elect and chosen, and
originating the name
"
whic it scorned. Not the Christian conceit
emanating from the
rce, and ving the flattering unction to its
soul of superiority over
eathen' of NS own time. Not the unbending
caste exclusiveness of the D
nan across whose path even the shadow of
the despised Sudra falling W ld be deemed deflement. Not any of these,
can equal the intolerant religio S pride of the Mahommedan, or reach the
pinnacle of religious self-sufficiency on which he has seated hiniself. To be
a Mahommedan, is enough- Cela suffit.
To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans, and
intimate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahommedan is above all things a Mahommedan. His
religion is the paramount question in his life, and remains its predominating
feature above everything else. This should not be surprising, since to the
" faithful" Paradise is secured, and all crimes and transgressions against
unbelievers' absolved.
