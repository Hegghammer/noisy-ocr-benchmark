ketches have made it. The wnote nat DCCII
enealogical works, almost of necessity, contain many errors.
tless
this
small
work
has
its
full
share.
But
when
errors
are
dis-
ed,
notice
thereof
should
be
given,
so
that
a
second
edition
may
de entirely truthful. Thankful to all who have generously given
assistance, this work is sent out as a small contribution to the
logical
literature
of
the
day,
and
in
the
hope
that
a
more
full
xtensive book of Horton chronicles may be issued at no very
t dav.
