study of printed directions and illustrations. If the worker will
closely observe his own work as it progresses, and follows instruc-
tions carefully, he should have no unusual difficulty in caning an
area very acceptably in the initial attempt. Particular attention
should be paid to directions which tell of errors to avoid. Errors
creep in, in a very unobtrusive manner at times, and the amateu
will find them hard to detect.
