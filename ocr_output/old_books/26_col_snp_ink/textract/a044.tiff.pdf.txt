THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
ARMENIAN PEOPLE
During a period extending over thirty years the civilized world has
heard of Turkish Massacres of Armenians. Massacres of a nature so
ferocious and c abolical, so bidcous and revolting, that no pen could adequate-
ly describe thei horrors
Writing in

4th edition of
I
book "Transcaucasia and Ararat" makes the following
grave comment :

is a short space in the life of a nation. But these
twenty years have
filled with sufferings for the Armenian Christians
greater than their
stors had to endure during the eight centuries that
have passed since t
Turkish Conquest of Armenia. They have been

occupies the geographical place it has held since history has been written.
The land of the Euphrates and Tigris, that Araxes valley, where, as simple
