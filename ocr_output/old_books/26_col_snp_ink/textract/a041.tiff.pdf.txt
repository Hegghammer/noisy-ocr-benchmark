like a round bow, a great brown eye revealed the inward spirit's intelligenco and zeal un-
quenched. On his head was a close-titting cap of purple velvet.
Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest men-Mgrditch
Khrimiau, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armeuian people-slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery ealled Etchmiatzin, or The Ouly-Begotten
is Descended." From the window of a neighboring room he might have looked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now all ent close and huried for
the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling suow and hurricane that hid the
cone of Arata And jist beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of that lake, eighity-seyeu years ago, Khrimian was horm. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Greece
from
his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom-a
reputation which still rather pathetically strivives throughout the Near East. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos now looked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to last it had been in-pired by one absorbing and unselfish aim-the freedom and
regencration of his people. It is tree he had failed.
From
his warliest years, when he had witnessed the terrors of Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armer round Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality-suct a
spirit as only kin
oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance aniong the
prosperons and CO
I the world. He began as a poet, wandering far and wide through
the Turkish, Persta
sian sections of Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jerusalent,
and recalling to his peol
the scenes and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic ordt
to the building of sehools,
which he generously threw 0
D
assassins of Armemans. For many
vears, while Europe was necup
wars, Austrian wars, or French and Germau
wars, we see him ceaselessly
ing from Van to Constantinople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the co
though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacte
nems of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenian par
h of Constantinople (1869), he was driven from
his office after four years.
But the eup of Turkish iniquity was ag. The pitiless slangliter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than even the Eur an Powers could stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the alls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to plead his people's cause a fore the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, ne visited all the great courts of Europe
beforchand, urging them to create :111 autonomous nentral state for Armenía, as they had
done with success for the Lebanon. In Lontlon he beeame acquainted with Gladstone ; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the loart of England, and,
in the Congress itself Khrinian could gain nothing for his people beyond the
promises
of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce
Turkey's
definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London amid shouts of " Peace with Honor,'
and Armenia was left to stew.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, bamished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Chureh and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake
