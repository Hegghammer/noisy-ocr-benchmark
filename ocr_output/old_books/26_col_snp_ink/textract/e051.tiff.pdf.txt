Fairies, and attendant ladies are described. Of two of the latter it
is said-
"Their kirtles were of rede cendel,*
I laced smalle, jollyf, and well,
There might none gayer go."
In the French version of the same poem it is, we read, more fully
expressed. It says, "They were richly habited and very tightly laced."

corse, which was at one time extensively used

corsets, may have been thus corrupted. This is SC.
probable, as
the word corset was in use at too early a period to admit
that origin,
Perhaps as early an instance of the use of the term corset
any in
existence may be found as a portion of an entry in the household register
of Eleanor, Countess of Leicester, which bears the date May 24, 1265 -
