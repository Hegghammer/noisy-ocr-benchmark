Van, and the lowest estimate counted the murdered dead nt 100,00). Gladstone made the
last great speech of his heroie life. England attempted some kind of protest. But rather
than join the Liberal demand for action, Lord Rosebery left his party for private leisure, and
Russia, France, and Germany combined to secure immunity for the "great assassin.'
It
was the lowest point of Europe's shame.
Blow followed blow. Hardly had the remmant of the Armenian people escaped from
massacre when their Church fell under the Irrutal domination of Russia. Plehve ordained
its
destruction, and Golitzin was sent to Tiflis as governor-genera to carry it out. Church
property to the value of €1,000,000 was seized by violence, the Katholikos resolutely refusing
to give lip the kers of the safe where the title deeds were kept (June, 1903). For two years
the Russian officials played with the revenues, retaining eiglity per cent. for their own
advautage. But in the mean time assassination had rid the earth of Plehye, and the over-
whehning defents of Russia in Manehuria were attributed to the Armenian eurse. Grudgingly
the Church property was restored, in utter chaos, and for the moment it is Russia's policy to
favor
the
menians as a balance against the Georgians, whom the St. Petersbarg government
is now del ed to destroy.

trust that the solemn pledges taken by Eugland and other Powers
at Berlin may be fultilied. The Bishop of Erivan, for instance, still Inbors for the appoint-
ment of a Christian governor over the district narked by the ill-omened names of Van, Bitlis,
and Erzeroum. I also found that even among the Georgians there was a large party willing
to concede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian villages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armeniau province, in the happy day when the Cancasus wins federal
autonomi, But the majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and industries. One ennot vet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolutionary parties of The Bell" and "The Flag." Of these,
the Social Democratic "Bell" follows the usual impraeticable and pedantie creed of St. Marx.
The " Flag," or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a great
assembly held in Erivan last August (1906) they adopted a programme of land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected laymen. If the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.
Whatever nay be the political future of the Armeuians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
