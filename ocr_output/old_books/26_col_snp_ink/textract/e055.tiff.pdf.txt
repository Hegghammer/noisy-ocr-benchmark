wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus describes a company of
ladies. They were, says he, "clothed all alike, in kirtles with rich capes
or mantles, parti-coloured, white, and blue, embroidered all over with
various devices." Their bodies are described as being long and small,
and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though each of them

wearing a splendid girdle of beaten gold, embellished with rubies and
emeralds, about her middle small.
Gower, too, when describing a lover who is in the act of admiring
his mistress, thus writes:-
"He seeth hir shape forthwith, all
