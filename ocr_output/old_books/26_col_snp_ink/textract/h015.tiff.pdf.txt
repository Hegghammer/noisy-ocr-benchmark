HORTON ARMS.
A stag's head cabossed, silver;
tinction, a canton ermine.
Crest, out of the waves of the sea prope
filed with a dolphin,
silver, finned, golt.
[Cabossed means cut off short so as not to sho
ermine, means the black spots upon the white fiel
preture the
artist has not given the shell upon the dolphin.]
Motto.- QUOD VULT, VALDE VULT," - What he will
Cordially and without stint.
Arms are hereditary, but the mottoes are not, and may be changed to suit the taste or fancy of
any family. There are other Arms of the Horton family, varying somewhat from the above. The
date of the grant of the arms I have not found-probably many centuries ago.
