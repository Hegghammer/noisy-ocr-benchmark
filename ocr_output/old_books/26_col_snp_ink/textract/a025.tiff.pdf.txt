Further in answer to Ahmed Riza Bey's account of the Armenian
"prétendus patriotards" in connection with the Ottoman Bank ; I cannot do
better than quote from Mr. Bryce's version of the story, and the massacre
that
followed
:
"In the following June serious trouble arose at Van, where
some
sort
of
insurrection is said to have been planned, though in the discre-
pancy of the accounts it is hard to arrive at the truth. Masses
furds
came down threatening to massacre the Christians, and a CD
1 which
many innocent persons perished, was with difficulty bro
end by
the intervention of the British Consul. A little late
11 revolu-
tionary party, emboldened by the rising in Cret
dans, being
well armed and outnumbering the Muslim
successfully
issued appeals to the Embassies and to the
I
t to introduce
reforms, threatening disturbances if the policy OT
and massacre
was persisted in. These threats were repeated in
and ultimately,
on August 26, a band of about twenty Armenians, be
the revolutionary
party, made a sudden attack on the Imperial Ott
Bank in Constan-
tinopie, declaring they were prepared to hold it at
W it up should the
Sultan refuse their demand. They captured the b
by a coup de main,
but were persuaded by the Russian dragoman to
draw upon a promise
of safety. Meanwhile the Government, who thr
their spies knew of the
project, had organised and armed a large mob
Kurds and Lazes-many
of whom had recently been brought to the cit
together with the lowest
Turkish class. Using the occasion, they laung A this mob upon the peace-
ful Armenian population. The onslaught bega in various parts of the city so
soon after the attack on the Bank that it ha obviously been prearranged,
and the precaution had been taken to employ the Turkish ruffians in different
quarters from those in which they dwelt: SV that they might less easily be
recognised. Carts had moreover been prepared in which to carry off the
dead.
For
two
days
an
indiscriminate
slaughter
went
on,
in
which
not
only
Armenian merchants and traders of the cultivated class, not only the indus-
trious
and
peaceable Armenians of the humbler class, clerks, domestic ser-
vants, porters employed on the quays and in the warehouses, but also women
and
children were butchered in the streets and hunted down all through the
suburbs. On the afternoon of the 27th the British Chargé d'Affaires
(whose
action throughout won general approval) told the Sultan he would land
British sailors, and the Ambassadors telegraphed to the Sultan.
Then
the
general massacre was stopped, though sporadic slaughter went on round the
city during the next few days. The Ambassadors, who did not
hesitate
to declare that the massacre had been organised by the Government,
