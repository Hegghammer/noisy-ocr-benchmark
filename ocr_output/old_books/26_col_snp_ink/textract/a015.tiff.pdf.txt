DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE.
I have thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested witnesses.
We are having a perfectly hideous time here. Thousands have been murdered-25,000
in this provinee they say ; but the number is probably greater, for eyery Christian village
was wiped ont In Adana about 5000 have perished. After Turks and Armenians had
made pence, the Turks eame in the night with hose and kerosene. and set fire to what remained

IN THIS HOUSE 115 WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ROASTED ALIVE.
Ilistory repeats itself. In 1895 Turkish soldiers foll upon seventy to eighty young
women and girls in a church, where they had fled for refuge, and after hidcously outraging
