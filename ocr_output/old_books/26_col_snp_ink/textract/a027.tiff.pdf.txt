was a race up to that time among non-Moslen peoples which with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armentan. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engage in
commerce and agriculture, and thus, by demoustrating its fruitfulness, increase the value of
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few among them justly an agitation, these our noble
and industrious brethren were being massacred

melted into tears.
Up to the present time the chers sorrow caused by this
meared, because this
bloody wound in our social body eannot easily be eur
fill our stommehs with
choice morsels, while we rest selfishly in our comfortabl
fatherless and brotherless
orphans, widows hungry, naked, and barefoot wander Il

families are fleeing from the fatherland. We are convin that the government is doing its
work, but what has happened is so great a calamity that it ean keep a government busy for
years. However much sacrifiee we may make, still it will be inadequate, because the
happiness of the fatherland depends on healing such blood wounds as these as soon is possible.
We are convineed that the government and all connected with it are persuaded of this as well as
onrselves. We must now wipe out the traces of the misfortune brought by a eursed period.
We must now comfort weeping hearts. We must understand and teach those who do not
understand that patriotism and brotherhood do not differ from each other. The responsibility
of the government for the Armenians is very great and very weighty. The whole Ottoman
nation is under obligations to proteet this suffering race, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
is
in large part due to the blood shed by the Armenians. We thought that these truthis
were so obvious that we preferred to keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary
from time to time to recall the greatness of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yesterday has endured only barbarism, and for twelve years
has
been constantly oppressed and ground to the earth, and has given thousands of victims.
Hereafter we must work to assure them that the era of massacres has passed, and with all our
strength of mind and soul we must quiet them. The obligation of the government to protect
them
is also very heavy, hecanse our Armenian live among wandering tribes.
We must all assist the government and point out its obligation. It must be declared in
public and periodically that the one of the most important duties of the Ottoman nation is to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and property of the
Armenians as well, since these are their saered rights. Let investigations be made and let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim."
This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare disclose
his identity ; and the account given by an authority like Mr. James Bryce
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as "les Massacres occasionnés par les aventuriers Arméniens."
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
