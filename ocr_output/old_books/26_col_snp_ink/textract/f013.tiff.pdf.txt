PREFACE
ix
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific his-
torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and the villains, for whom of old no
mud was too thick and slab. Beliefs are being
ussailed on every side. To abolish the tradition l
courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the
e
conduct of Captain Hind
be
strokes of the unkindest, a
ed
no such iconoclusm. Even
be-
lieve, I have told the tale
een
worth the telling-as it is
f
nal
trials, or in Smith OF Johnson,
old
sources, decorously stripped of much
age.
For really, where much that seen
lible
may be fully proved, and where
table
turns out not rurely to be fulse, 'tis 3,
way.
To continue the story of the high
from
Smith and Johuson down to the upp.
g end
of all such things in the beginning
nine-
teenth century, is like taking up and
luding
a half-told tale. But it was worth
doing.
Only in respect of the great figure
bin has
always made, has it been found reall
ecessary
to seriously consider and re-state thi
sureer of
that much-overrated scoundrel, and
put him
in his proper place : " very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
