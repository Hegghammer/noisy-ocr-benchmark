PART II.
OUT OF THE DEPTTIS.
Oh that my head were waters and a fountain of tears, that
I might weep day and night for the slain of n people."
A book has been written and publish in Japan, its title 44 Niku Dan'"
translated into English, reads, "Hun Bullets.' This little book, a
narrative of the siege of Port Arthur, being read through the length
and breadth of the empire, found anslators to translate it into the best
known of languages ; and its young uthor, himself an actor in the siege,
was summoned to the presence a is sovereign to be thanked and praised.
The book is a graphic parrative
me most terrible siege in history, wherein
is vividly por rayed the deadly
ugale SS of the besiegers. It contains as an
acknowledger nt of its m
a page on which is recorded the Field
Marshal's app dation, and
her page bearing the Commanding General's
commendation
In simple
nor carries the reader through appalling
scenes of horr
read we are made to realize the slaughter of
the enemy's m
of their ground-mines, electric-wire entangle-
ments, and expl
MS; we are made to hear the roar of the artillery
fire dealing deati
destruction, and there rises before us the mental vision
of the fierce hanato hand conflict, and the dead and dying lying thickly in
the dark ravine.
" For hill and battle plain,
With dying men and slain,
Grew mountain heights of pain,
And mine is boundless woe."
The grim warrior who stormed and took the most impregnable fortress
in the world gives expression to his feelings on his own great achievement,
in saddest words.
"And mine is boundless woe,"
For the grim warrior's heart is cleft in twain for the human bullets that
under his command hurled themselves to their death.
