PREFACE.
No one, we apprehend, would be likely to deny that, to enable the
fairer portion of the civilised human race to follow the time-honoured
custom of presenting to the eye the waist in its most slender pro-

Our
information will show how ancient and almost universal its use has

This difference probably arises from
host
unyielding and stubborn character being
the
time the severest attacks were made upon the
no
reasonable doubt that much which was written
lon

exaggeration. It would also be not stating the whole of
we
omitted here to note that modern authors, who launch
ng
anathemas on the very stays by the aid of which their wives
nd
daughters are made presentable in society, almost invariably quote
largely from scribes of ancient date, and say little or nothing, of their
own knowledge. On the other hand, it will be seen that those
