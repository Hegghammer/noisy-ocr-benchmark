PREFACE
ix
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific his-
torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and excalted the villains, for whom of old no
mud icas too thick and slab. Beliefs ure being
assailed on every side. To abolish the traditional
courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the considerate
conduct of Captain Hind would, therefore, be
strokes of the unkindest, und I have here attempted
no such iconoclusm. Even where I camot be-
lieve, I hace told the tule-icheneber it hus been
worth the telling-as it is found in criminal
triuls, or in Smith or Johnson, and other old
sources, decorously stripped of much vile language.
For reully, whère much that seems incredible
may be fully proved, and where the believable
turns out not rarely to be fulse, 'tis your only way.
To continue the story of the highwaymen from
Smith und Johnson down to the upprouching end
of all such things in the beginning of the nine-
teenth century, is like taking up und concluding
a half-told tale. But it was worth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpin hus
always maile, has it been found really necessary
to seriously consider and re-state the carcer of
that nuch-overruted scoundrcl, and to put him
in his proper place : (l very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
