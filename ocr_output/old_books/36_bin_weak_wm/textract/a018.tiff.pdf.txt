The first and second parts of this litile book were written and printed
in pamphlet form for circulation in the United States, shortly after the

Introduction and Revival of Christianity in Armenia.
The illustrations and the extracts from the periodicals Harper's
Monthly," "The Wide World" and the "Cosmopolitan' have been added
to the and printing.
