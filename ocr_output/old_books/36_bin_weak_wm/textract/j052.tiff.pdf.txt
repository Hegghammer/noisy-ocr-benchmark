SEAT WEAVING
Care must be exercised to keep the strands from overlapping im-
properly at the corners. The strands should fit snugly where thev
go over the rails. To assure this, tap them sharply with a mallet
used over a block of soft wood. This may be done at frequent
intervals or when several strands have been woven over each rail.

Uniform tension on the strand is desirable and this should be tight.
As the work progresses the interior between the upper and lower
rows of strands is stufted. This is done with the same material as
that used in the weaving. The butt ends of rush are used to stuff
the seat of rush; raffia is used to stuff a raffia seat; craft paper to
stuff a fiber seat and so on. The packing should be done in a thoro
manner, for it builds up the seat and prevents its breaking down at
the inner edges of the rails, and sagging with continued use. A
slightly curved hardwood stick about 12 in. long may be used to
advantage to do this work. Fig. 41 shows a sketch of such a stick.
It is 3/4 in. in diameter at one end and tapered to 1/2 in. bv 1/8 in. at
