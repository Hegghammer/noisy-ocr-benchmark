like a round how, a great brown cye revealed the inward spirit’s intelligence and zeal un-
quenched. On his head was a close-titting cap of purple velvet.

Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century’s greatest: men—Merditch
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people—slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called tchmiatzin, or“ The Only-Begotten
is Descended.”” From the window of a neighboring room he might have looked across the
frost hound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were vow all cut close and huried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling suow and hurricane that hid the
conc of Ararat. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of that lake, ecighty-seven years ago, Khrimian was born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land ; the Sultan still counted ag one of the formid-
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byron xct out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the geucrous champion of freedom—a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Near dast. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Watholikos now looked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to last it had been inspired by one absorbing and unselfish aim—the freedom and
regencration of his people. It is true he had failed.

From his carliest years, when he had witnessed the terrors of Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round .Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationalitv—such a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance among the
prosperous and contented of the world. THe began as a poet, wandering far and wide through
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wife’s death, he devoted himself to the building of schouls,
which he generously threw open to Kurds, the hereditary assassins of Armenians. For many
years, while Europe was occupied with Crimean wars, Austrian wars, or French and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying from Van to Constantinople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emblems of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenian patriarch of Constantinople (1809), he was driven from
his oflice after four years.

But the cup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiless staughter of Bulgwiians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. With varied inotives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to plead his people’s cause before the Congress of Berlin. ‘Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Hurope
heforchand, urging them ta create un autonomous neutral state for Armenia, as they had
done with success for the Lebanon. Tn London he became acquainted with Gladstone ; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and,
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey’s definite reforms. It 3s needless to say that uone of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to Londou amid shouts of “ Peace with Honor,”
aud Armenia was left to stew.

So it went on. Detained in Constantinople ax prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake:
