than over a half a century; and lastly Jonathan G. Horton, absut a
half a century; making in all two hundred and thirteen years at the
death of Jonathan G. Hortom, 3 July, 1873- These six generations
all living and dying in the old mansion 1 Could those old walls rc.
echo all the words ever spoken there, and exhibit anew all the seenos
ever witnessed there-the book containing such a record would vastly
exceed in volume the size of the old castle. It would bring to light
much that is now in darkness, and must forever remain hidden from
the generations of the living.
At the death of Jonathan G. Horton, the old homestead became,
by will, the property of the Rev. Mrs. Williams, of Brooklyn, N. Y.
who was the adopted daughter of Jonathan G. Horton, he never
having had issue, so that on the sd of July, 1873. the old homestend
went out of the Horton name.
Mrs. Williams proposes to sell it, and if some of the Hortons do
not bay it, it will indicate a lack of decent respect for the old castle,
if not for the Horton name. It should be bought back into the
Horton name, suitably repaired and preserved for the wonder and
admiration of generations of Hortons yet unborn. Jonathan G.
Horton, the short, thick man, and Stuart T. Terry, are the twno men
seen in the engraving, in front of the old house.
