was a rane up to that tinne among non-Mosien peoples which with and doep freling
homornd the Ottotam fatherland that was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most mearly the national drees, who >pouk and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Berides this it is the Armenians who engage
in
and agrieulture, and thus, by demoastrating ite fruitfulsess, increase the value of
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few among them justly starte) an agitation, these oar moble
and industrions brethren were being masserol. What a terrible scene! When we
left the school building we saw hundrede of the badior of our Armenian compatrinta beioz
removed in carte lege and arns wero hanging dowa ontride. Thie hoody socue will
ever retuaia impresso) on my mind.
se This shocking crime of Vildia formed a deep lake of bload, and this lake, during the
whole coure of a cursed up to the lasi moment, grew wider. Exen during the
past nine monthe of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feeling which had been shown,
ihe awful evente in Adans took place and the soul of all true Ommalia meltal into tears.
Up
to the present time the deep esused by this event has not diapprarol, because this

choice morsels, while we rest selfishly in our comfortable beds, these fotherless and hrotherless
orphans, wádows hungry, naked, and harefoot wander hicher and thither, and thousande of
families are fleeing from the fatherland Il'e are convinced that the government is doing it-
work, bat what has happened is 60 great a calamity that it can keep a government hasy for
years, However much sacrifice we taxy suake, still it will be inadoquate, because the
happiners of the fatherland depende on bealing such blood vounds no there de soon au panible.
I''e
are
convincel that the government and all conneeted with it are persuadod of this as well as
We taunt now wipe out the traces of the misfortune brought by a curio) period.
We now comfort weeping hearts, We tuant undersland and feach those who do not
understand that patriotirm and brotherhool di not differ from each other. The responsibility
of the government for the Arminians is very great and very weighty. The ubole Ottoman
nation is under obligations to protect this suffering nace, the liberty we enjoy
to-day
la in large part due to the blool abod by the Armenisus We thought that thaie traths
were 60 obvious that we preferred to keep vilence, wherea to-day tre understand that
it
is
necorary from tims to time to recail the greatnos of oar obligation. We must not forget
that this anhapps people up to yesterday has endared oaly harbarisa, and for twelre

Hereafter we must work to thene that the ena of masacros has passed, and with all our
strength of mind and sou! we quiet them. The obligation of the goveratement to protect
them is also very heavy, becanse our Armenian live aunong wandering tribes,
We saust all assint the government and poiat out ite obligation, It mast be declared in
pablic and periodically that the one of the most important duties of the Ottoman nation is to
protect, together with those of other racos, the interests, the life, and property of the

This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare disclose
his identity : and the account given by an authority like Mr. James Bryce
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as "les Massacres occasionnés par les aventuriers Arméniens."
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
