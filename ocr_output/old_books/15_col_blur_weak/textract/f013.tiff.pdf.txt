PREFACE
ix
Most of like to keep a few of the illusious
ice belieced in shen schoolboys. Scientific his-
torieus hare degraded many of onr aucient heroes
and exalted the villains, for of old no
mad too thick and slab. Beliefs are being
assoiled ou ecery side. To abolish the traditional
courtesy of Clande Dw Vall or the considerate
conduct of Coptoin Hind would, therefore, be
strokes of the makindeal, and 1 huce here attempted
no snch iconoclasur, Even there I causot be-
liece, I haze told the il has been
morth the telling-(18 il is found in criminal
trials, or in Smith or Johnsow, and other old
sources, decorously stripped of much cile laugunge.
For really, schère much that secma incredible
may be fully proced, and where the believable
tarua out not rarely to be fulse, 'tia your ouly reay.
To continue the story of the higheaymen from
Smith and Johuson doveu to the approaching end
of all such things in the beginning of the mine-
Leenth century, is like toking up and coucluding
a half-told tale. But it soorth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpia has
always made, has it been found really necessary
to serioualy consider and re-state the enreer of
that wnch-operrated sconndrel, and to put him
in his proper place : " cery much lover one
than he usually occupies.
