We give BARNAEAS HORTON as the Proface and Introduction to this
little volume of Chronicles. He was probably the son of Joseph
Horton, of Leicestershire, England, and born in the little hamlet of
Mousely of that shire. or his history before he came to America very
little is known. He came over in the ship in 1633-38.
He landed at Hampton, Maw. How long he remained at Hampton
is
not
known.
But in 1640 we find him with his wife and two chil-
dren in New Haven, Conn., in company with the Rev. John Youngs,
William Welles, Peter Hallock, John Tuthill, Richard Terry,
Thomas Mapes, Matthias Corwin, Robert Ackerly, Jacob Corey, John
Conklin, Issac Arnold, and John Badd, and on the 2111 day of
Oct., 1640, awisted by the venerable Rev. John Davenport and Gov.
Eaton, they organized themselves into a Congregational Church, and
sailed to the east end of Long Island, now Southold They had all
been members of Paritan churches in England, and all had families
with them except Peter Hallock. They doubeless had been on the
island previous to this time and looked out their homes. On nearing
the shore they cas lots to decide who should first set foot on the land.
The lot fell on Peter Hallock, and the place where he stepped upon
the land has ever since been known as Hallock's Landing.
On coming ashore, they all knelt down and engaged in prayer,
Peter
Hallock leading, as had been determined by the lot. These
were the first persons of any civilized nation that had ever attempted
to settle on the end of Long Island. Ser Grifin's fourmal.
Barnabas Horton was a man of deep-toned péety, and a warm advo-
cate of civil and religions froedom. He was one of the most promi-
nent and influential men of Southold. He was for many years a
magistrate, and several times a member of the General Court at New
Haven and Harford. He built the first framed dwelling-house ever
erected on the cast of Long Island, and that house is still (x875)
standing and occupéed. It is a shingle-house, that b, shingles are
used for weather-boards, and the sides have never been reshingled,
and the roof but once, according to the statement of Jonathan Gold-
smith Horton, the last Horton occupant of the old house.
