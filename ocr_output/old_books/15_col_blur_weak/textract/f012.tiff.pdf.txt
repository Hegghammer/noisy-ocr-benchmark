PREFACE
from Smith, icho himself soas prome to include
the most extraragent myths in his pages, calla
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE Laves AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAMOUS
HIGIWAYMEN. Both of them include pirates and
murderera. Of the "truth" of much in Smith
and Johnaon, the less said the better.
No one has eper reprinted those enthora in
their original extraeagance, or their grossness.
Il rould be impossible; and, i possible, il sould
not be enterlaining. Nor has any one ecer edited
them, or ecen scritteu independent history of
the When see consider how astonial-
ingly popular those romances hare ecer been
schich hare had Claude Du Vall, and Turpia,
and their like for heroes, this is not et little
surprising.
Perhaps the task has been abondoned becmuse
of the dificully-the almost insuperable difficulty
of sifting fact from fiction, and beemuse of e
chilling sense that it vould be a thankless thak
to present the as he really : a
fellow rarely heroie, generally foul-mouthed and
ernel, and often No noveliat could
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dig-
service; and I do not think the historian scho came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery could be sidely rend.
