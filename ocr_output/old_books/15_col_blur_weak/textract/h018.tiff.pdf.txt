It is said that Barnalsas Horton 1. was large in stature, and of a
raddy complexion, and of fine social qualities
His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone
was re-lettered about filly or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It h elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. The original base was of brick, but it had all crumbled down
many years ago. The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Hortos.
The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads
as
follows:
- lieve Neth buried the body of Mx. HORTON, who was borm at
Osd England, and diel si Nouthold, on the day of
July, aged So years."
In the centre of the stone we find the Epitaph, as follows:
-
- Here lies my body tombed in dunt
"TII Christ shall to raise is with the jund:
My soul ascreded to the throme of God,
Where with non I moke aboder
Thera alter my wille,
To be of this tife:
Asd you, dear childrem, all Sollow the Lend,
Hew and obey His peblic anored wond:
Amd in your homes call upon His
For of I have you to the
Them God will yom with your childrew all,
Amd to this Meised place tie will you call."

It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the original
thirteen who brought his tomistone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and memory
should not perish from the earth.
