next morning the sheep were gone, and Isaac and his son Roy, went
up the hill at Liberty Falls to look for them. Before they got beyond
the clearing they found dead sheep scattered along the log fence. and
others dying. Nearly all the flock were killed. They even killed a
lamb in the pen adjoining the house.
