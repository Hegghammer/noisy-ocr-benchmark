is necessary before the weaver feels confident of readily caning any
area of odd shape.
In weaving the dispunals it is frequently necessary to run several
in one hole in order to keep the canes as straight as possible. Just
when this should be done can only be determined by the worker,
A diagonal should never be permitted to swing to any great degree
out of a straight line. A close observation of the photograph of
the wing will reveal many diagonal canes in one hole, and several
boles skipped entirely.
Five-Step Caning-Cane weaving of five steps is not com
It may be done in many cases where it will not be subject to hand
wear. It is neat in appearance and is much simpler than seven
step coming. The presumption should not be made that this weave
will in any way supplant the regular weave, but in instances where

show the weave clearly. The first strands are strung in, in the
