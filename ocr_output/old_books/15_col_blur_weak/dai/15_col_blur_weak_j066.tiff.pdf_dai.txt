SEAT WEAVING
splints of various widths may be cut without more to a change
Splints need to be soaked in water for a momber of minutes before
ning. They will be found to be somewhat less pliable than inner
hickory bark, and different in color, varying from almost white to
a light brown. Inner bark is a not brown in color. The splints
stain well, and may be dipped in identically the same manner av
reeds. Inner hark needs no stain; in fact is more pleasing if left
Ash splints are extensively gathered and prepared by the Indians
in certain sections of Canada and the northern states. There they
are woven into baskets of intricate design and beautiful colors,
uually in combination with other materials, as sweet gram. Splints
may be used for almost every purpose for which flat reed is utilized,
and in numerous cases is superior and preferable to reed.
In Fig. Sa is shown in order, two rolls of hickory splines, a
bundle of inner hickory bark strips, and a small hank of flat reed.
These are in the original bundles as they come from the dealers.
