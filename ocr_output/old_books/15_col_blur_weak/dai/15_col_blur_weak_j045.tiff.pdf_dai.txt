RUSH SEATING
Rush seating, employing either genuine rush or substitutes, may
be done to good advantage and with excellent results in manual
training shops. No equipment is needed to maintain such work.
The addition of a woven seat to a chair or stool constructed in the
shops will necessarily employ a new, interesting medium in com-
edge of materials and possible combinations. And, as with caning,
the resultant interest in the work at hand more than justifies its
introduction in mamal trainig shope. Rud seating employs a very
simple weave. Different materiale employed in weaving naturally
require different degrees of skill, and the difficulties encountered
are those resulting from handling materials and not because of the
complexity of the weave. One may very readily undertake the
ruhing of ordinary seat frames after a study of printed directions
and illustrations. It should be understood at the outer that, in
discussing rush seating, materials other than genuine rush are in
Historical.-In the British Museum in London is a seat of
curios shape of Egyptian manufacture, which, it is estimated, was
made previous to gooo B.C. A small amount of rush still clings to
the seat frame. The relative date of the construction and weaving
of the chair seat would indicate that runh seating is by no means a
modern art, altho at present rush is extensively employed in fur
of rush in England dates no earlier than 1720. Several
types of chairs were made there between that date and 1870. In
France rah was used extensively in the seating of furniture of
Normandy and Brittany about 1750 Flanders produced rush
