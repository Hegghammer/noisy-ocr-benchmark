CANING SUGGESTIONS
As weaving progresses difficulty will be experienced in inserting
cane ends in the holes, due to their becoming filled. Force the
watch awl thru and turn it several times. This will effectively
force an opening
In many instances long mds of cane remain from one series to
another. These generally, as previously mentioned, should be used
in accending steps. There is one limitation. They should be
used provided it is not necessary to carry them over more than four
holes on the under side of the frame. The fewer loue m√°s left,
the better for the caning in thereby meater and better. It is gener
ally advisable to use a full length strand to avoid a number of
The amateur will find his greatest difficulty in properly weaving
the diagonals at the edges that is, immediately upon entering or
leaving a bile. Many commendable pieces of caning are spoiled
by ragged, improperly woven edges. Care most be taken to see
that the case goes sevr and under the proper strand or strands ar

Study in carefully.
The addition of a hinder is generally a matter of taste. Perhaps
so per one of modern hand caned furniture does noe employ a
binder of any description. The series of regularly exposed holes
are rather pleasing and in no way detract. However, in chair seat
a binder is evential to protect the ends of canes, for they are subject
Binders of reed or of wood called "splines" may be used on hand-
caned frames. If either is wed a groove in deep and 3/16 in.
