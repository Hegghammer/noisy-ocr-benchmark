Preface-Introduction
It is said that Barnalas Horton I. was large in stature, and of a
raddy complexion, and of fine social qualities
His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It is elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. The original base was of brick, but it had all crumbled down
many years ago. The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Horton.
The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads as
follows:
- Here Nieth buried the body of Mr. Barsanas Horros, who was born at
Monsely, Leicestershire, Old England, and died at Southold, on the 13th day of
July, 1680, aged So years.‚Äù
In the centre of the stone we find the Epitaph, as follows:
- Here lies my body tombed in dust
My soul ascended to the throne of God,
Where with sweet Jesus now I make abode :
Then hasten after me, my dearest wife,
To be partaker of this blessed life
And you, dear children, all follow the Lord,
Her and obey His public sacred word;
And in your houses call upon His name,
For of I have advised you to the IRDE
Then God will Mess you with your children all,
And to this Mesed place He will you call."
Heh, xi 4He being dead, yet speaketh."
It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the original
thirteen who brought his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and memory
should not perish from the earth.
