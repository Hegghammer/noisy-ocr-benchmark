The discussion of the weaving processes to follow is confined
in the main, to stoods or seats. Fig. 53 shows several stools different
in design both in wood contruction and in weaving. In two in-
stances it will be noted that weaving is done over a separate frame,
one being inverted between the rails, the other fastened on top,
leaving a little projection. Reference is made to several possible
weaving designs and the use of various mediums and combinations
The posible combinations of materials are merely suggestive of
designs of varying complexity may be worked out. An excellent
white paper strips in, in width. The design will show up very
clearly because of the contrast of the Mack and white. Experi-
satisfactory. The paper strips are an excellent means to an end.
The stool top illustrated in Fig. 54 employs a simple over-and-
under weave, utilizing flat reed. The worker needs to decide at
the outset on the character of weave to be used unless it be of
unusual design. In this instance the weaver runs over there and
under three strands, and the wrapping done in a series of three.
To begin the operation tack an end of flat reed under a short rail
at a corner, then bring the strand out and over the rail, across the
frame opening to the opposite rail, under this rail, across under
neath the frame opening to the bottom of the first rail. This com
pletes the process once around. Repeat three times; then wrap the
strand around the two rails, without running it across the top
This every fourth strand across the top is omitted. It is not
necesary to cut the strand; the wrapping is continuous Repeat
