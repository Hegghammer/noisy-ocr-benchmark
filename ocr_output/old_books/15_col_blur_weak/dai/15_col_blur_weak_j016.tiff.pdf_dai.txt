in either rail that has been used but sery, working from caned side
toward the open frame. Go over and under the strands necessary
to form the weave, turning the needle from side to side in order to

the end down thru the hole, pairing the cases. Pull the came up
thru the next hole; then start the needle from the opposite side of
the frame and repeat the first operation, this pairing another set
of cames. Continue stil all cames are paired and all holes used.
