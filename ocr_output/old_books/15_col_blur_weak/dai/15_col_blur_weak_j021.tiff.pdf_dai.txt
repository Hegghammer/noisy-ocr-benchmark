CANING SUGGESTIONS
holes are bored and weilized in the came weaving. These are not
abolutely necessary; in fact caned areas on many pieces of period
and modern furniture do not utilize corner holes. In such instances
two diagonal strands are run in each hole on either side of the
corner. A comparices of the areas, the one employing a corner
former appears complete while the latter appears unfinished
It is frequently necessary or desirable

posed to view, and is especially advisable
back chair shown in Fig. 7. This chair CH OF
of William and Mary design was made
in a school shop, is hand caned, and of mahogany. The exposed
came is covered with strips of mahogany 34 in, thick and 1 in, wide
in which a groove 34 in, deep and 16 in, wide has been run. This
groove may be made with saw, chisel, or combination plane. Fig. 8
Many pieces of so-called expensive furniture have ragend, exposed
caming. This is sightly and is not to be commended
sary that the frame be stained before caning is begun. Box fuming
will not permanently color cane. Oll stains make no appreciable
impresion if rubbed off at once. But water, acid, and alcohol
stains produce decided colors. If the worker desires to color the
cace approximately the same shade as the article, the caning may
be done on the white wood and the entire article stained at the one
operation. Cane may be shellacked or varnished or left natural, ,
Irregular Areas-Fig. 9 shows a close view of the back of the
chair illustrated in Fig. 7. This is a typical example of an irregular-
shaped area for coming. The principles of weaving remain the
