Van, and the lowest estimate counted the mandered dead at 100,000. Gladstone_mad: the
last great speech of his heroic life, England attempted some kind of protest. But rather
than in the Liberal demand for action, Lond Rosebery left his party for private leisure, and
Run, France, and Germany combined to secure inaimanity for the great assassin." It

Blow followed bow, Hardly had the remnant of the Armenian people escaped from
massacre when their Church fell under the brutal domination of Russia. Fiebre ordained its
destruction, and Golitzin was sent to Tiflis as governor-general to carry it out. Church
property to the value of 1,000,000 was seized by violeuce, the Katholikos resolutely refusing
to give up the keys of the safe where the title deels were kept (June, 1903). For two years
the Russian officials played with the revenues, retaining cighty per cent. for their own
olvantage. But in the mean time assassination had rid the earth of Plehre, and the over-
whelming defeats of Russia in Manchuria were attributed to the Armenian curse. Grudgingly
the Church property was restored, in niter chacs, and for the moment it is Russia's policy to
favor the Armenians as a balance against the Georgians, whom the St. Petersburg government
is now determined to destroy.
Such was the post upon which the worn old man, stretched on his monastic bed, looked
back that winter's morning. Singleness of aim has its reward in spiritaal peace, but of the
fature he was not hopeful." He no longer even contemplated an autonomous Armenia, either
on Turkish territory or on Russian. On the Russian side of the frontier the Armenian
villages were too scattered, too much interspersed with Georgians and Tartars, to allow
of autonomy. On the Turkish side, he thought, massacre and exile had now left too few of
the race to form any kind of community. Indeed, for the last twelve years the Armenian
villagers have been crawling over the foot of Ararat by thousands a year to escape the Kurds,
and every morning they come and stand in fresh groups of pink and blue rags outside the
monastery door where the head of their Church and race lies dying. They stand there in
mate appeal, as I saw them, passing nothing in the world but the variegated tatters
that cover them, and their faith in their Katholikos, Slowly they are drafted away into
Tiflis, Baku, or their Caucasian villages, but nowhere are they welcomed.
Some of the bishops and monks, who form a council round their chief, still look for
Europe's interference, and trust that the solemn pledges taken by England and other Powers
at Berlin may be fulfilled. The Bishop of Erivan, for instance, still labors for the appoint-
ment of a Christian governor over the district marked by the ill-omene names of Van, Bitlis,
and Erzerum. I also found that even among the Georgians there was a large party willing
to concole all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian villages are thickert,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Caucasus wins federal
autonomy. But the majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and industries. One cannot yet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolutionary parties of "The Hell" and "The Flag" Of these,
the Social Democratic "Bell" follows the usual impracticable and polantic creed of St. Marx.
The "Flag" or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a great
amerably held in Erivan last August (1906) they adopted a programme of land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected laymen. If the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.
Whatever may be the political fature of the Armenians, they seems likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
