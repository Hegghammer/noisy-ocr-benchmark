CANING: THE SEVEN STEPS
open squares are thus formed over the area being caned. Unles
the came is soaked it will prove rather difficult to pair the canes
Step 5. This step is the weaving of one set of diagonals. Start
se strand at any corner hole. Use one hand over and one under
to give the came a slight curve and work with both hands on the
upper surface. Use an end of cane
long mough for convenient hand-
ling: then pull the entire strand
thru the length of the frame, pro-

and will supplement the freehand
sketch. The curners will hind, and the strand will pull with dif-
culty if the cane is incorrectly woven. On parallel canes note that
ither run seur or under the pairs.
Step 6. This step is identical with the preceding one. The cases
are at right angles to the first diagonals. In this step and the
This holds true in all rectangular frames where a corner hole is
bored. It permits the strands to run in as straight a line as pos-
sible. If it is necessary to turn abruptly to enter a hole it is obvious
that an error has been made by the weaver.
Step 7. Pull a case of the same size as used in the cher steps up
A loop is thus formed and the binder secured. Pull taxt, then
