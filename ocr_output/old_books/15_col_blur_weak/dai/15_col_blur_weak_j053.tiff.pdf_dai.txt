Rectangular Seats-As stated, in weaving a square seat the
initial process is repeated at all corners until all openings are filled
In rectangular seats the spaces on the short rails will fill before
those on the long rails. Weaving around corners is then manifestly
impossible. Fig. 42 shows a partly woven sear with the short rails
filled, and the process of filling up the remaining area under way.
The method is this: Go over and under a long rail, across half the
frame opening and up thru them across the remaining distance, and
over and under the other long rail. Repeat until the seat is com

method of filling in the center just described. It supplements the
photograph and makes the method clearer.
