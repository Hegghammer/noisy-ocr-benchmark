xIv Preface —letrniuction,
This book is mainly what tho who have kindly farnished nocords
amd sketches have mace it. The whole has heen carcfully compiled.
That genealogical works, almost of necowlty, contain many errom.
Doabslow this small work has its fell share. Bat when errors are dis-
covered, notice thercof shouk! be given, so that a second! edition may
he made entirely crathfal. ‘Thankful to all who have gencrousdy given
their awistance, this work is sent out a a small contribution to the
genealogical literature of the day, and im the hope that a more full
aml extemive book of Horton chronicles may be iwacd at no very
distant day.
