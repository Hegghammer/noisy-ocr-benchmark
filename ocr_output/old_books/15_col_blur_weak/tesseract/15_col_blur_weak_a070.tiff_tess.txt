In the foregoing pages | have directed my humble efforts to sketch out
what the Powers of Europe have done in the past, and how their actions
have reflected on my unfortunate race.

It is consklered good policy now by a certain class of European writers
to ascribe all the horrors of the Rodiaes Massacres to Hamid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as unassailable and unconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as a sort of superhuman being who swept everything
belore im to the consummation of his own despotic will The reason for
this is not difficult to perceive. They would fain disavow the part Europe
has played in the tragedy, and to do this successfully it becomes necessary
also to present Turkey to the world now as a paradise (from whence the
tyrant once removed) peopled only by saints and angels; so we have also
many roseate colored word pictures of Constitutional Turkey.

â€˜The murders, deportations and imprisonments of the Turkish revolu-
tionaries, or more correctly reformers, were undoubtedly the sole work of
Abdul Hamid and bis palace clique, but Abdul and his minions could not
have carried out that hellish work of wholesale extermination of the
Armenians without the perpetration and participation of the Turkish
people. It is true the massacres were originated and organized in the

lace, the Palace clique stirred up religious a and race hatred, but
the co-operation of the people was necessary ; t oon
in order to plunder Sad enrich theaselves with the worily "goods t the
Armenians always knew how to acquire by their own industry and toil; the
appeal to their marauding and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
