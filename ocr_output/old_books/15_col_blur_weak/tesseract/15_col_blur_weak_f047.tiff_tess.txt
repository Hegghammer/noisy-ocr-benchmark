ROBIN HOOD *%
more pleasant to consider the romantic spirit that
evolved him and gave him his exquisite setting
of mossy glades and giant oaks, where the sun
comes in golden-green shafts through the em-
howering foliage, and you hear the winding of
the hunters’ horns in chase of the deer. There
is a springtime gladness in the old verses, of
which this is typical :

Whan shaws bene sheene and shroddes full fayre,

Awl aves both large and longs,

tuts merry walking in the fayre forrit

To hear the small birds songe.

To se the dere draw to the dale,

And leve the hillés hee,

And shadow hem in the levis grene,

Under the grene-wode tre,
It is the springtime of the year and of the
English nation that you glimpse in these lines;
a picture of that larger rural England of possible
adventure, and uncontaminated skies that is now
a thing of the past.

Nature is portrayed in these ballads with a
vividness and certainty that more ambitious poets
cannot match :

The woodweels sang and wok! not conse,
Sitting wpon the spraye,
See lowde, he wakened Robin Hood,
In the greenwood where he lay.
It is versifieation of the simplest and the most
sincere kind.

Robin Hood, real or imaginary character, has
himself no criminal taint, but he is one of the
Vou. F. 4
