be
orgy, except to call them fiends incarnate ; and who is the bold man who
can guarantee that these same fiends incarnate have become metamorphosed
and changed all of a sudden; or that the handful of liberal Turks ax Con-
stantinople are capable of controlling and restraining them. We have not
even heard that the leaders and participators of last massacres have
been punished as they deserved ; and what is the reason they are left un-
ished ? because the Government is afrakl to punish Mahomumedans for
ing Christians; because the liberal Turks dare not punish the “ true

believers " for killing “ Kaffirs.”

The religion of Mahommed, the religion of the sword, has been infused
into the Turk, and to understand the of the religion of Mahommed
upon the Turk, it is necessary to regard it from four aspects, or from four
ao analysis. First, the fundamental doctrine and law of the religion.

the character of the founder as an example to his followers. “Third,
the racial and ethnographic characteristics of the Turk. Fourth, the effect
which this particular religion would be likely to have on this particular race.
When we have viewed the Turk and his government from these four points
of analysis, we have the explanation of all the woc and desolation which
have lain over the countries under Turkish rule.

“When ye encounter the unbelievers strike off their beads until you
have made a great slaughter of them" is a chapter of the Koran which the
Turk has religiously and steadfastly made his creed.

In conclusion, I will ask my readers to compare one point of difference
between the two races, the oppressor and the oppressed. “Thousands upon
thousands of Armenian women, thousands upon thousands of Armenian
children, have been hounded to death, or savagely, ferociously, horribly and
Se omely maltreated by the Turk, and yet in all the agonizing years when
Massacre has succeeded upon Massacre, has there heen one known case or
one single instance of a Turkish weman or child maltreated by Armenians ?

The last massacres though especially organized from the Palace at
Constantinople, were officially announced to originate from an afiray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed one of the three :
given equal n and arms, the Armenian is always a match for the

urk, but alas for him that unequal numbers and want of arms have always
made him the victim of his oppressor.

through its own fallacious arguments falls to the ground. I will quote one
passage as an example.
