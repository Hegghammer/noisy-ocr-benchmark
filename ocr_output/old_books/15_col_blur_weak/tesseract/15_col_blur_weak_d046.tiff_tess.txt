32 THE CHILD OF THE MOAT

walk up and down the hall. The children were gen-
erally allowed to go out after dinner and amuse them-
selves, but it wae a wet day and Aline was looking
disconsolately out of the window wondering whether
she should go into the library or what she should do,
when the angry dame thought that the child offered
an object for the further exercise of her power. “‘ Why
are you idling there!" she said. “They are all short-
handed today, go you and scour out the sink and then
take out the pig-bucket and be quick aboot it.”

Aline gave a littl gasp of surprise, but rap off at
once. The buttery door was open and she aw Thomas
drinking and offering a tankard to one of the other
servants, and she heard him laugh loudly as he pointed
to « row of goblets, four of them clean and the rest of
them dirty, while he ssid,—-‘‘ Edward cleaned those, and
I am waiting here as long as it would take to clean
them."" Tie caught sight of her and scowled, but she
pawed on.

Aline had soon finished the sink and ran quickly
with the pig-becket, after which she returned to the
dining hall to tell Mistress Mowbray she had finished.
Thomas had just come in, 20 she stood and waited.

He beld ap the four goblets on « tray for Mistros
Mowbray to inspect.

“Yes, those are better, Thomas,"’ she said frigidly.
Thomas could not conceal a faint smile and the lady
became suspicious. ‘‘By the way, Thomas, there are
a dozen of these goblets, bring me the others.”’

“You, Mistrems,’’ said Thomas, triumphantly, “but
they were all dirty and I have just cleaned thee.”

Mistress Mowbray saw that she could not catch him
