at the suggestion of my parents, I decided to learn the backenith

theeship for several years, On the rpth of October, 1827, 1 married
Phebe Tompkins, amd on the oth of March, 1820, we moved to Poeks-

| Lill village, where we have resided ever since. I bought some pro-
perty, and set up the blackwaithing busines. I sacceeded well in the
bexines In the «pring of 1835 1 entered into a co-partnenhip bad-
new with Mr. Traman Minor, wader the firm name of ‘ Minor & Hor-
ton," amt went into the foandry badees, manufacturing agriculreral
implements, principally ploughs and plough<adiags, Our lanines
increased rapidly, and paki ws well. We continued partners for
twenty years, In a8g¢ Mr. Minor retired from bodnow, and I took
in Mr. Geo. W. Depew asa partner, and about two years afterwards,
we admitted cach of ws a son, and the firm then became, ‘ Horton,
Depee & Sons." Our manalactered articles were sold in nearly every
State in the Union, and also in many forcign countries.

“In 1862 we all sold out to a aock company, formed for that par-
pow. Having been in active basines for thirty years, I now retired.
