AMONGST the ethnic writers, Homer appears to be the first who
describes an article of female dress closely allied to the corset. He
tells us of the cestus or girdle of Venus, mother of the Loves and Graces,
and of the haughty Juno, who was fabled to have borrowed it with a
view to the heightening and increasing her personal attractions, in order

poct attributes most potent magical virtues to the cestas, but these are
doubtlessly used in a figurative sense, and Juno, in borrowing the cestus,
merely obtained from a lady of acknowledged clegance of figure a
corset with which to set her own attractions off to the best possible
advantage, so that her husband might be charmed with her improved
appearance; and Juno appears to hare been a very far-seeing and
sensible woman, From periods of very remote antiquity, and with the
gradual increase of civiliation, much attention appears to have been
paid to the formation and cultivation of the female figure, and much the
