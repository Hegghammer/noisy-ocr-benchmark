‘The reader will see at a glance the plan of this book. We com-
mence with the Christian name. Then follows the parentage, genea-
logical data, &c., and then the Christian names of the children and
onder of births In many of the carly families the exact onder of
births cannot be awertained ; bet it has been approximated as nearly
as pomible. ‘The lincage is given in connection with the fing member
of the family. The Koman numerals indicate the order of births.
‘The som ami daughters of the ok! Puritan, Barnabas, comstitate the

| second generation, bat they are spoken by way of eminence as Jowph
1, Hannah J., &c. The book contains much repetition, but none
too much to make it plain and casy to study.

‘This little book contains the chronicles of only about one-half of
the Horton families looked up. Those whose genealogical data are
given only in a wall part, and tho whow correct lineage has not
been satisfactorily ascertained, arc not inchaded in this book.
