| 10 THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINT.

| belles of the tribe were not slow in discovering that, when arrayed
in all the panoply of forest fincry, a belt well drawn in, as shown in the
annexed illustration, served to display the figure to much greater advan-
tage than one carelessly or loosely adjusted. Here, then, we find the
first indication of the use of the corset as an article of becoming atin,
At the very first dawn of civilisation there are distinct evidences of the
use of contrivances for the reduction and formation of the female figure,
Researches among the ruins of Polenqui, one of the mysterious forest cities
of South America, whose history is lost in remote antiquity, have brought
to light most singular evidences of the existence of a now forgotten
race. Amongst the works of art ducovered there is a bas-relief repre-
senting a female figure, which, in addition to a profusion of massive
omaments, wears a complicated and cliborate waist-bandage, which,
by a system of circular and transverse folding and looping, confines the
waist from just below the ribs to the hips as firmly and compactly as
the most unyielding corset of the present day.

At the paied of the dcovery of some of Spe Se
Eastern Archipelago, it was found customary for all young females to
wear a peculiar kind of corset, formed of spirally-arranged ratran
cane, and this, when once put on, was not removed until the celebration
of the marriage ceremony. Such races as were slowly advancing in the
march of civilisation, after discovery by the early navigators, became ,
more and more accustomed to the use of clothing, to adjust and retain d
made sufficiently broad to fit without undue friction, and stiff to
pve fgg nthe at sop gy
about, at once became in effect corsets, and suggested to the
of the ingenious a system of cutting and fitting so as more perfectly to
adapt them to the figure of the wearer. The modes of fastening, as
we shall sec, have been various, from the simple sewing together with
the lace to the costly buckle and jewelled loop and stud.
