Pairies, and attendant ladies are described. Of two of the latter it
is xid—

‘Thore might nome gayer go.” |
In the French version of the same poem it is, we read, more fully =|
expressed, It mays, “They were richly habited and very tightly laced.”
The Lady Triamore is thus described :-—
“The lady was in a porple pull,

Wharton quotes from an ancient poem, which he believes to date as
far back as 1200, in which a lover, speaking of the object of his
admiration, thus throws down the gauntlet of challenge, and exclaims—
™ Maddie ber abe bath meek small.”
The word ment or maint being used instead of very or much. Some
differences of opinion have existed among writers as to the origin of the
word cerut. Some are of opinion that the French words corps, the
body, and uerrer (to tightly inclose or incase), led to the adoption of
the term. Madame La Sante gives it as her opinion, however, that it is
more probably a corruption of the single word corps, which was formerly
written corz, and may be taken as a diminutive form of it. Another
view of the matter has been that the name of a rich material called
corse, which was at one time extensively used in the manufacture of
corsets, may have been thus corrupted. This is sarcely probable, as
the word corset was in use at too carly a period to admit of that origin.
Perhaps as carly an instance of the use of the term corset as any in
existence may be found as a portion of an entry in the houschold register
of Eleanor, Countess of Leicester, which bears the date May 24, 1265 >—
