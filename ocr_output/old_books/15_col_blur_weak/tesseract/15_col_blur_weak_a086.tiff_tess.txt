meaning ; sometimes modes of expression are so difficult to translate from
one language into another, and it can be said that the term “ Hluminator " is
used for want of a better word in English. The Armenians call their
religion “loois havat” the word “loois” means “ lige “and “havat”

The cathedral of Etchmiatzin is identified with Gregory; its name
“Etchmiatzin” means in the Armenian language “the only begotten is
descended,” and the story attached to it is, that ina vision Christ appeared
to Gregory descended in light; Gregory built his church on the spot where
the vision had appeared to him, giving it the name of “ Etchmiatzin” (only
begotten descended). The cathedral also gives its name to the town
Eschmiatzin, the ecclesiastical metropolis of Armenia.
