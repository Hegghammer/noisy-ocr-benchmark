Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and loag grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another cull, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this super-added evil, is, the
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, greater marauders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation of whose lives comprises
murder and robbery, and who have through weary centurics uaremittingly

murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Not the most fertile
