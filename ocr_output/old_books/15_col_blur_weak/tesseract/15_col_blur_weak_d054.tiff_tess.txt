“0 THE CHILD OF THE MOAT

with thin wasted cheeks and hollow sunken eyea She
stretched out her small band as the two children ap-
proached and a amile lit up the white drawn face.

Aline stooped and kimed ber. “Oh, Joan,"’ she said,
“I with you would get well, bat it is always the same,
no sooner are you up than you are back in bed again.
I have been asking Master Mowbray about you and he
has prominnd that the leech from Rarnard Castle shall
come and me you as soon as he can get word to
him.”*

"Tt is good of you to think and plan about me, Mis-
tress Aline, and I believe I am not quite so badly to-day,
but I wish that horrid old ‘Moll o' the graves’ would
not come in here and look at me. She does frighten me
so. Mother was always so frightened of Moll."

“She is a wretched old thing,"’ sald Audry, “‘bat do
not let us think about her.”’

“You mustn't thank us, anybody would do the aame,"’
said Aline; “‘you cannot think how sorry we are to ae
you like this, and you must just call me Aline the same
as I call you Joan. See! Audry and I have brought you
a few flowers and some little things from the Hall that
old Fispeth has pat up for us, and when the leech
comes, he will soon make you well again.”

“"l sometimes wonder whether I shall ever get well
any more; cach time I have to go beck to bed I seem to
be worse. All my folk are gone now and I am the only
one left. The flowers are right bonnie though and the
smell of them does me good,"’ she added, as she lifted
the bunch of carly carnations that the children had
brought.

After she had spoken she let her hand fall and lay
