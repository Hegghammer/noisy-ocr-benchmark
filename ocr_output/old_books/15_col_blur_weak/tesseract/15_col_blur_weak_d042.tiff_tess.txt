a THE CHILD OF THE MOAT

They were almost too excited to sleep and Aline, as
her custom was, when she lay awake, amused hereif
by bailding castles in the air. Sometines she would
imagine hereclf as a great lady, sought after by all the
noble knights of the land, but holding herself aloof with
reserved dignity until one, by some deed of unusual
distinction, should win her favour. As a rule, however,
this seemed rather a dull part to play, though there was
something naturally queenly in her nature, and she
would therefore prefer something more active. She
would take the old Seots romance of Bard Helen, or
Bunt Aline, a her own inspiration, and follow her
knight in the disguise of Â» page over mountain and
torrent and through every hardship. This better eunited
the romantic sclf-cacrifice of her amal moods and, by
its imaginary deeds of heroism, ministered just as much
to her sense of exaltation. To-night had opened vistas
of new suggestion; and she pictured her knight and her-
self fleeing before a boat of enemies and miraculousdy
disappearing at the critical moment into the secret room.
Bat at last she fell into a sound slumber and did not
wake til] it was nearly thee for the morning meal.
