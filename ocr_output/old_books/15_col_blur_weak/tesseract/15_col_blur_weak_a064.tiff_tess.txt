Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
‘Turkish rule? To this question, we must answer an emphatic No!

‘The causes that must operate against any chenge are many and deep-
ns Lees ee
\ (or it may be F ) ar j are going to
the thought and character of the nation. The characteristics of a people
change very slowly, if they ever change at all, and the predominant national
traits of the many-blooded modern Turk have been shown to the world to
be, cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a fierce coe! and what is
more than all, and which has to be remembered most, is, that they are a
people accustomed to the unbridled gratification of their worst passions.

The ethnographic traits of the Turkman which history bears out, are
wildness and fierceness, and it would not be incorrect to argue that with the
instincts of his primitive ancestors have been assimilated the many cross
currents that run in his veins, into all of which has been infused the
doctrines of the religion of the sword, a religion which Coes not make for
the peace or well being of mankind; a religion, also, ee ee ee
the two sexes to the degraded position of being created solely gross
pleasure of the other, does not make for the exaltation of ind.

To quote again the eminent avthority iously referred to: “' No
Mahommedan ie or dynasty has ever Soe ioelt able to govern well
even subjects of its own religion, while to extend equal rights to subjects of
a different creed is forbidden by the very law of its being.

Not the Jewish conceit proclaiming itseli God's elect and chosen, and
originating the name “ heathen" which it scorned. Not the Christian conceit
emanating from the Jewish source, and laying the flatrerieg unction to its
soul of superiority over the “heathen ” of its own time. Not the unbending
caste cxclusiveness of the Brahman across whose meal ig the shadow
the despised Sudra Se ee ee Not any of these,
can equal the intolerant religions prile of the Mahommedan, or reach the
pinnacie of religious self-sufficiency on which he has seated himself. To be
a Mahommedan, is enough—Cela suffit.

To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans, and
intimate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahommedan is above all things a Mahommedan. His
religion is the paramount —— in his life, and remains its predominating
feature above everything else. ‘This should not be surprising, since to the
“faithful” Paradise is secured, and all crimes and transgressions against
“unbelievers " absolved.
