ilies tomlbetone is of Engtnh blac marble, five feet long and about
three fect wile. lt is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone
was re-letiered aboot fifty of sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It i» clevated about cighteen inches from the ground, on a good mone
bax. ‘The original base was of brick, bet it had all cremblad down
many years ago. The preent hae was pet ander the some at the
time ft was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Horton.

The imeription surrounds the border of the one, and reads as
follows :

~thewe Beth barbed the beely of Ma. Hassanas Howton, whe ens here af
Mounely, Letoeterdhire, O84 Rngtumd, amd decd a Southold, om the np day of
Joly, s68o, aged Se your”

In the centre of the mone we find the Epitaph, a follows:

= Bhewe Bees any Reedy teemlere! oe ot .
“Tit Chwhe shall comme to raie it with the jut; *
My woul aucewediod to the theome of (oud,

It is axl that this epitaph was written by hinwelf, and that it, to-
gether with the inecription, date of his death excepted, was all put
npon the stone before he died. He was the only ome of the original _
thirteen who brought hi tomistone with him, aad this fact seems to
indicate 2 commendable deure to we that bis name and memory
should not perish from the carth.
