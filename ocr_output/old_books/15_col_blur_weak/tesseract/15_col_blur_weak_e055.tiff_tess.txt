THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE. 49 :
having only her kirtke upon her back. John Gower, however, who
wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus describes a company of
ladies. They were, says he, “ clothed all alike, in kirtles with rich capes
or mantles, parti-coloured, white, and blue, embroidered all over with
various devices.” Their bodies are described as being long and small,
and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though cach of them
had been a queen. We find that the tight-laced young ladies of the |
court of the Lady Triamore “had mantics of green-coloured velvet, |
handsomely bordered with gold, and lined with rich furs. Their heads
were neatly attired in kerchicfs, and were ornamented with cut work and
richly-striped wires of goki, and upon their kerchiefs they had each of |
them a pretry coronal, embellished with sixty gems or more ;” and of =|
their pretty mistress it is said in the same poem, that her cheeks were as
red as the rose when it first blossoms. Her hair shone upon her head
like golden wire, falling beneath a crown of gold richly ornamented with
precious stones. Her vesture was purple, and her mantle, lined with white
ermine, was also clegantly furred with the same. The Princess Blanche,
the daughter of Edward Ill, the subject of the annexed illustration,
appears to have copied closely the dress above described, and, like the
maids of honour of the Lady Triamore herself, she is not only richly .
habited but thoroughly well-laced as well, Thus we sce, in the year
1365, the full influence of the corset on the costume of that period.
‘There is another pocm, said to be more ancient than even Lawn/fal,
which, no doubt, served to give a tone and direction \to the fashicns of
times following after. Here we find a beautiful lady described as
wearing a splendid girdle of beattn gold, embellished with rubies and
emeralds, about her middle small.
Gower, too, when describing a lover who is in the act of admiring
* He seeth bir shape forthwith, all |
Hir bodye rowed, hir middle sonal."
