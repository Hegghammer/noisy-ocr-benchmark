On the field the ever victorious army of little Japan undermined Russia's
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
defeated and ever retreating army of colossal Russia. At sea the ever
victorious Japanese Fleet in completely annihilating the Russian
Fleet. It was war such as the world had never yet seen. The secret of
such astounding successes should be investigated, and here I beg leave to

from one of a series of articles in which | gave view to my opinions
