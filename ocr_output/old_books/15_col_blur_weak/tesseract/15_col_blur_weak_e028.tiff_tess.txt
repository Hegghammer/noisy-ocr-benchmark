carls down to her feet; her teeth were like the seeds of the pome-
granate; and walk like that of a drunken clephant or a goose.”

The Persians entertain much the same notions with regard to the
necessity for slenderness of form in the belles of their nation, but differ in
other matters from the Hindoos. ‘The following illustration represents a
dancing-gitl of Persia, and it will be scen that her figure bears no
indication of neglect of cultivation. It is somewhat curious that the
Chinese, with all their extraordinary ingenuity, have confined their
restrictive efforts to the feet of the ladies, leaving their waists unconfined.
That their doing so is more the result of long-established custom than
absence of admiration for elegantly-proportioned figures will be clearly
proved by the following extract from a letter published in Chamber?
Journal, written by a genuine inhabitant of the Celenial Empire,
named Woo-tan-zhin, who paid a visit to England in 1844-45. Thus

| he describes the ladies of England —

“Their eyes, having the blue tint of the waters of autumn, are
charming beyond description, and their waists are Jaced as tight and thin
as a willow branch. What, perhaps, caught my fancy most was the

| sight of elegantly-dressed young ladies, with pearllike necks and tight-

__ aced waists; nothing can possibly be so enchanting as to see ladies that
compress themsclves into taper forms of the most exquisite shape, the
like of which I have never seen before.”

By many writers it has been urged that the admiration so generally

felt for slenderly-proportioned and taper waists results from an artificial

| taste set up by long custom; but in Woo-tan-zhin’s case it was

| clearly pot so, as the small-waisted young ladies of the “outer
barbarians” were to him much as some new and undescribed flowers or
birds woukd be to the wondering naturalist who first beheld them.
