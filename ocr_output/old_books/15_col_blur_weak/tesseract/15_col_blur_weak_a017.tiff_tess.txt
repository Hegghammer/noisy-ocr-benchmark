As these sheets are going through the press there comes news of famine
at Zeitoon. The Rev. F. W. Macuilum, Rental Missionary at Marash,
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet, American Missionary at Constantinople, thar
ss,000 sosis in and around Zeitoon are dying of hunger ; they ere wandering
about in rays, mixing bran and water, cooking and eating it, if they can
get even that. Rev. Macullum adds, “ The same story comes to us from all
sides. As we foresaw all along, from now on the distress will be greatest.”

If $0,000 were massacred, the list of those who have died and are dying
of homelessness and starvation will exceed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerated. Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.

The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered in a night attack
Re neat are now reduced to extreme distress Before

outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeatedly appealed
eS the —— Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch

repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec-
don for the villagers of Mush ne a Kurdish attack as Bpprehendat. It is
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
