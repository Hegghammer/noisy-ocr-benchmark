Jrom Smith, who himeelf was prone to inelude
” the most extravagant myths in his pages, calls
hie folio A Guxerat axp True Hisrony or
rue Lives axp Acrioxs or toe Mosr Famous
Hicuwayuesx. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the “truth” of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.

No one has ever reprinted those authors in
their original extravagance, or their grosences.
It would be imposible ; and, if possible, it would
wot be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
them, or ccen writen an independent history of
the highicaymen. When we consider how astoniah-
ingly popular those romances hace ever been
which have had Claude Du Vall, and Turpin,
and their like for heroes, thia ia nol a little
surprising.

Perhaps the task has been abendoned because
of the difficully—the almost inanperable difficulty
—o sifting fact from fiction, and because of a
chilling sense that it would be a thankless task
fo present the highwayman as he really waa: a
Sellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
eruel, and often cowardly. No novelist would
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dis-
service ; and I do nol think the historian who came
to the subject im thie cold scientific apiril of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
