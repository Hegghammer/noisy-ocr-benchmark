PREFACE ix
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we belieced in when schoolboys. Scientific his-
torians hace degraded mang of our ancient heroes
and exalted the cillains, for whom of old no
mad wos loo thick and slab. Beliefs are being
aasciled on ecery side. To abolish the traditional
courtesy of Claude Da Vall or the considerate
conduct of Captain Mind would, therefore, be
strokes of the unkindest, and I hace here attempted
no auch iconoclaam, Even where I cannot be-
liece, I hace told the lale—ichenecer il has been
worth the telling—as it ia found in criminal
trials, or in Smith or Jolson, and other old
sources, decoroualy stripped of much cile language.
For really, where much thal seema incredible
may be fully proced, and where the beliecable
turns out not rarely to be falee, ‘lia your only way.
To continue the story of the highcaymen from
Smith and Johnson down to the approaching end
of all auch things in the beginning of the nine-
teenth century, ia like taking up and concluding
a half-told tale. But it waa worth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpin has
always made, has it been found really necessary
to seriously consider and re-atale the career of
that much-ocerrated scoundrel, and to put him
in hie proper place: a cery much lower one
than he wsaally occupies.
