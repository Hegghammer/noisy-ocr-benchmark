COLONIAL FLORIDA. 13
he ordered his fleet to sail along the coast,
whilst he, by rather a circuitous march, would
advance in the same direction. This parting
Was at once final and fatal. He again reached
the Gulf, somewhere in the neighborbood of St.
Marks, with his command woefully wasted and
diminished by toil, battle and disease; and, as
can well be imagined, with his dreams of avarice
and dominion rudely dispelled.

No tidings of the fleet from which he had so
lucklessly parted being obtainable, despair im-
provised that fleet with moticy sails which we
have seen mooring off the island of Santa Rosa
in the carly days of October, its destination
being Mexico—a destination, however, which
was but another delusion that the winds and
the waves were to dispel.

Narvaez found a grave in the maw of the sea,
as did moat of the remnant of his followers.
Famine swept off others, leaving only four to
reach Mexico after a land journey requiring
years, marked by perils and suffcrings incident
to such a journcy through a vast forest bounded
only by the sea, intersected by great rivers, in-
habited by savages, and infested by wild beasts.
