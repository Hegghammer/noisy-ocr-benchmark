MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE.

fe will be seen by the engraving that the olf home is double. ‘The
western part is that which was beilt by Harnalas in 1659-60. The
cau or two-story part was beilt by Jonathan |, about 1682. The upper
room of this part was mex! for a court-home for nearly twenty years,
as we learn from Thompon'’s History of Long Idand, and woe of
the old benches eux! when it was a court-hoaw are still preserved.
The old “castle,” as Jonathan G. Horton, its lat Horton occepant,
ted to call it, is in all probability the oldest wood hoe in America.
I know of no dwelling home of any kind, stone or brick, now mtand- :
ing, that can date hack as far as this venerable ok mansion. ‘There
were a few hats on the cat of Long ieland previogs to 1640—two oF
three it is mit on Shelter Inland. Hat these, as well as those built by
the Puritans, immediately on their settlement in Southold, wom all
pamed away. Not a vestige of any of the fir generation buiklings
can be found except this one. Ht remained for the howe that Barnabas
bailt to survive the wreck of ages, and to stand to-day a a noble .
representative of the dwellings of two hundred and fifteen year ago.
Bhat the old howe stands to-day not only as peering above all others
by its age, bat ales by its occupancy. It is not very often that we find
two generations of the same name, living and dying in the ame howe —
rarely find three. But here we have six generations in waccesion, all
bearing the Horton name, living and dying in the same howe, and
all born in it except Barnabas [., and his won Jonathan. We may go
to the castles amd palaces of the ok! world, and warch long and dili-
gently, and fai) to find a paralict cae.

| With a few repairs, the old castle may yet stand for generations fr
in the fatare.

It requires wore thought and reflection to realize the Lapse of time
since the old house war built. See the okf Puritan hiomelf there
twenty years; then his son Jonathan, tweaty-<ight yoan ; and then
Jonathan, Jr., about sity years; and pext Lawrence and Ads son Jona-
