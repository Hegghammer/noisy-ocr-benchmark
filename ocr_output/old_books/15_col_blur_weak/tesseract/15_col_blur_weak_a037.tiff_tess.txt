No one doubts that a great forward movement is reaching its culminat-
ing point in the destiny of Asia. ‘The West has learnt its all of religion (the
a ee mankind) from the East, and now the East
would fain learn the law of restraint and the law of freedom (the protecting
ra pred of mankind) from the West. Inspired by this feeling the liberal

decidedly mean a they are re ~ a sincere desire 2
ensure and security of life and property fort erogencous
under the urkish sway, but they themselves have had to contend dnd sul
have to conten! with a fanatical populace.

To the Mahommedan world at large the Caliph of Islam is the envoy of
God, the sacredness of whose person must be inviolate. Abdul Hamil, the
astute politician, knew that the security of his sovereignty depended on his
Caliphal rights, and his main policy during the long period of his execrable
reign had been directed towards preserving and asserting the same; thus
we can see how his dethronement, which the liberal Turks would gladly have
rey. amen simultaneously with the inauguration of the Constitution, had
to be deferred to a later period, and how it was necessary for the She k ul
Islam to pronounce the Ca iph a traitor to his sacred trust, a violator of the
holy law of the Prophet, his dethronement could be dared or
accomplished. ?

The Christian Armenians in Turkey live in the midst of the followers
of a hostile religion, with no power or bree behind them which makes for
a. Who does not know that the sgreat numerical preponderance of

induism keeps the balance of power in India, and restrains bloody religious
hostilities; and when we review the whole religious history of Christian
Europe, and that ee long roll of crimes committed in the name of Him
who expounded His religion with the parable of the Good Samaritan, aad
the precept of loving one's neighbour as one's self, we cannot feel surprise at
the fanatical outbursts of the followers of Mahommed, the founder o! a
religion whose doctrines certainly fall short of the humane principles
“inculcated by the Founder of Christianity. If authentic historical facts prove
to us that horrible and atrocious crucities have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other religionists, but on fellow Christians of different
denominations, then can we expect better things from the Turk unless
some power or force restrain him ?

Christianity has now partly ipated herself from the ferocities
which darkened and poured the Fadl stream of blcod on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at lange, religion is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite.
