CHAPTER III
RESEATING A CHAIR; HAND CANING
In many localities it is impossible to find a professional to reseat
caned chairs either by hand or with cane webbing. Many chairs
in good repair and worthy are relegated to the attic because of
broken or sunken seats. Upholsterers generally will not be troubled
with such jobs of caning for the work does not pay unless there
is an amount sufficient to keep them steadily employed. Usually
they are not adept enough to do such odd jobs as may come to them,
even tho willing to do the work, within a time consistent with
sufficient money returns.
Chairs of ordinary size may be caned for a minimum of $1 and
a maximum of $2. If the holes have previously been bored, much
labor is thus avoided, and the charge is naturally made less. The
professional cane weaver has various ways by which he determines
the cost for recaning a given seat. Perhaps the most common
method employed is that of charging so much per hole. This is
from 1 to 2 cents. The difficulty in handling very fine cane is also
a factor in deciding what to charge. Usually a casual looking over
of the chair by the expert is all that is necessary to fix a price. No
charge of less than $1 on a hand caned seat will sufficiently re-
munerate the worker. Fig. 18 shows a hank of cane and rolls of
machine woven cane.
Any boy who has had instruction and sufficient experience in
caning in the manual training shop may readily undertake jobs of
caning. The boy who will investigate will find that he may
work
up a sizeable trade in chair seating in a short time. In fact several
boys will not overcrowd a given field. Such work will pay the
amateur well. He does not, nor cannot expect professional wages.
It is of considerable value from the pupil's standpoint alone, that
is, this correlation with his manual school activities. The amount
