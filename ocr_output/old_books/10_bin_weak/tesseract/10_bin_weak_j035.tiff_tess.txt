otherwise the final weaving will prove difficult. The finished seat,
when dry, should ring when struck sharply with the fingers.

The method of tying cane, preventing twists, etc., has been ex-

Refinishing.—The refinishing of a chair is a distinct problem,
and one which the cane weaver should understand. He should
