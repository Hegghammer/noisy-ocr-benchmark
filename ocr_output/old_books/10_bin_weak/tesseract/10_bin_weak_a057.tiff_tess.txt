‘Church, but was also a fearless patrigt—a distinguished linguist, an eloquent preacher, nud a
thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between ‘Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the feared fanatien] uprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the winds and took
astep that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history.

At the first inceting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruek to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinaple, sent
hy Monseigneur Nereés, the Patriareh, their object heing to request the signatory Powers of
the Berlin Treaty to foree x guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important improvements in Armenia,

Abdol Hamid and his advisers were furious at this affront, and Monseigneur Nereés was
summoned to the Palace. It is said that when he received the summons he simply smiled
and asked one of of his curates to read the Burial Service to him, as he did not expect to
return alive. However, he went. No one has ever heard what passed between the Sultan
and himself at the interview; suflice it to say that he immediately summoned the Armenian
General Assembly and tendered his resignation. This was not aceepted by the Assembly,
and, amidst enthusiastic cheers, he was carried hack to his apartments at the Patriarchate.
Meanwhile x peremptory order reached him, signed by the Sultan, to reeall the Armenian
delegation from Berlin. This Monseigneur Varjabétian point-blank refased to do, and retired
to his private residence at Haskeuy, a village on the Golden Horn. ‘The sucecss of the dele-
gation, however, did not came up to his expectations. The Armenians, as it happened, could
not be heard, but they were so far successful as to have an artiele inserted in the treaty.

The Sultan and his advisers never forgave the Patriareh this, though they could not
openly do anything to him on account of his cnormons popularity. ‘Time passed on, and to
all appearunee the incident was forgotten, but it was not so. One summery afternoon a most
cordial invitation was sent by a very high dignitary of the Palace, requesting the Arehhishop
to dine with hin informally, An invitation of this kind could not very well be refused, so .
the Archbishop, accompanied only by a body-servant named Vartan, repaired to the Pasha’s
house. The Pasha received him at the door and escorted the visitor with much ceremony and
extreme courtesy toa private apartment of the salamlik of his house (the men’s quarters),
where dimer was served. The gentality displayed lay his host dispelled any fears that the
Archbishop might haye had as to his personal safety.

After dinner, as usual, coftee was served. Now, this serving of the coffee is rather a
ceremonial acc8rding to high Turkish etiquette, and it is not unusal for guests to bring their
own tchooboukdar (the servant who carries his master’s pipe and pouch snd also superintends
the making of his coffee, The Archbishop was presented with a “ tchoebouk ” (pipe) tilled
and lighted for smoking, and a servant followed with coffee. The Archbishop accepted hath
with due compliments to his host, und took a sip at his coffee. Just at that moment the
heavy curtains over the doorway were thrown apart, revealing the ghasUy pale face of his
servant Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, ina voice trembling with emotion, “ Monseigueur,
I did not brew the coffee!”

This was enough for the Archbishop ; he pretended to he startled and spilt the coflee, but,
alas! he had already dtunk a small quantity of it. Meanwhile a seuflle was gotug on behind
the portitre, where his poor servant Vartan was paying the penalty of lus devotion to his
master. Concerning Vartan’s whereabouts or his ultimate end nothing was ever made public
—the poor fellow simply vanished. Monseigneur Varjabétian, after a short interval thanked
the Pusha for his generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily summoned. The Patriarch took to his hed,
and lost all his hair through the effects of the poison. Then, one morning, when a servant
