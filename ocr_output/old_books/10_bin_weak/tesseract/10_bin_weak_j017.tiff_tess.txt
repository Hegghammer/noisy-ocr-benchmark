CANING; THE SEVEN STEPS 13
open squares are thus formed over the area being caned. Unless
the cane is soaked it will prove rather difficult to pair the canes.
Step 5. This step is the weaving of one set of diagonals. Start

the canes either run ever or under the pairs.

Step 6. This step is identical with the preceding one. The canes
are at right angles to the first diagonals. In this step and the
preceding one note that two strands run into the corner holes.
This holds true in all rectangular frames where a corner hole is
bored. It permits the strands to run in as straight a line as pos- |
sible. If it is necessary to turn abruptly to enter a hole it is obvious
that an error has been made by the weaver.

Step 7. Pull a cane of the same size as used in the other steps up
thru a hole, over the binder cane and down thru the same hole.
A loop is thus formed and the binder secured. Pull taut, then
