like a round bow, 2 great brown cye revealed the inward spirits intelligence and zeal an-
quenched. On his head was a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.

Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century’s greatest men—Merditch
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people—slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Ltchmiatzin, or The Ouly-Begotten
is Descended.”” From the window of a neighboring room he might have looked across the
frost hound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were vow all cut close and huried for the
winter, Beyond the plain stood a dark inass of whirling snow and hurricane chat hid the
cone of Ararat. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of that Inke, eighty-seven yeurs ago, Khrimian was born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land; the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byron <ct out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom—a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Near Kast. Long and
stormy bad been the life apon which the Natholikos now Icoked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to last it had been inspired by one absorbing and unselfish aim—the freedom and
regencration of his people. It is truce he had failed.

From his earliest years, when he had witnessed the terrors of Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round wArarat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationalitvy—such a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance amone the
prosperous and contented of the world. He began as a poet, wandering far and wide through
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of «Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wife’s death, he devoted himself to the building of schools,
which he generously threw open to Kurds, the hereditary assassins of Armenians. For many
years, while Europe was occupicd with Crimean wars, Austrian wars, or Freneb and Gernian
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying from Van to Constantinople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emblems of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenian patriarch of Constantinople (1860), he was driven from
his office after four vears.

But the cup of Turkish iniquity was filing. The pitiless stuughter of Bulguiisns and
Armenians alike was more than even Uhe European Powers could] stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to plead his people’s cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the yvreat courts of Murope
heforchand, urging them ta create an autonomous neutral state for Armenia, as they had
done with success for the Lebanon. Tn London be became acquainted with Gladstone ; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and,
in the Congress itsel{ Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkcy’s definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed.  Beaconstield returned to Londou amid shouts of “ Peace with Honor,”
and Armenia was left to stew.

So it went on. Detained in Constantinople ax prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Kutholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake:
