When this book was written, the writer was 7
. ‘
under the supposition then generally current that 5
the Armenian Massacres of April, tgo9, in Cilicia < '
were instigated by Abd-ul Hamid and his Yildiz
. ey: = . : |
Clique. Babikian Effendi, the Armenian deputy '
4
who went to Adana from Constantinople to in- , 4
. : e
vestigate into the massacres, plainly reported that I |
all investigations had failed to trace them to Abdul |
Hamid and his Yildiz Clique. Babikian Effendi, . ,
as was to be expected, died suddenly on his return ‘
to Constantinople, but later on it became known ‘
thatthemassacres ol April, 1909, had been planned, ° \
prepared, organized and carried into execution by -
. . ve
| the Constitutional Government of what has been fe ‘
\ called ‘Liberal Turks” or ‘* Young Turks.”
