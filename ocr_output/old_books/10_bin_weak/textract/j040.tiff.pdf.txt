plane and chisel before permanently assembling the parts. In fact
this is a necessary procedure in grade schools and other schools
where special machine tools are unavailable. The necessary tools
for pressing in the webbing lie near the frame, Fig. 28. These
are a small mallet, a chisel, and several hard wood wedges. The
wedges are made in several widths, to enable them to enter the

groove at the abrupt curves, are + in. long of 1/4 in. stock, tapered
to 1/3 in. on the faces.
Step 2. The cane should be boiled in water for a minute or so,
or allowed to soak for several minutes in warm water until thoroly
pliable. Then lay it on the frame and cut it to the shape of the
seat, allowing half an inch excess around the entire piece.
A
pattern of card or bristol board will prove of material assistance to
the amateur as well as the expert. The front line or edge of the
pattern must run parallel with the horizontal or vertical strands of
cane. Pull out all weavers at the edges of the piece of cane where
they run over and parallel with the groove. Then lay the webbing
over the frame, and see that the weavers run parallel with the
front of the frame. With wedge and mallet as illustrated in Fig.
29 begin at the front and force the webbing into the groove. Insert
on the opposite side next, then the other two sides in order. The
curves may be done last.
