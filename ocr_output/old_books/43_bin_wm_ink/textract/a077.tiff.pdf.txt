I will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and relate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
1796 after ruling over Armenia fifty-eight years.
He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his deminions, and
grew to be so mighty in battle that the neighbouring nai
IS
called
his
country Aramia and the people were called Aramians
names as
Armenia or Armenians being no doubt later corruptions.
The first victory of Aram was over Neuchar king
whom he
took prisoner and put to death, and made a large part
y of the
defeated prince tributary to his own. The second vi
as over
Barsham king of Babylon, whom also he took p
death.
The next victory was over the king of Capp
f the
Cappadociar
pursued to the very shores of
the
whole of Cappadocia
nus
king of Assyria, at one time an eage
m,
sought to cultivate his friendship.
No doubt if the volumes and scripts of I
or parchment of the famous
Alexandrian library, which burned for six n
as fuel in the four thousand
baths of the city, had escaped that most at

preserved instead, vast treasures of kno

the ancient kingdoms of Western Asia mi

when the tide of Islam victory rolled 0)
the kingdom of Armenia, how
much of the story and history of the pe e was lost and destroyed along
with the destruction of their independend would be difficult now to calculate
or assert, but in taking up link by link whatever knowledge has been left
to us, there scems to be grounds f supposing that the " Aramzaans'
designated by foreign writers as "a cople of Semitic race language and
religion, coming from Northern Aral la and settling in the region between
the western boundaries of Babylonia and the highlands of Western Asia'
were no other than the Hai who under their King Aram had spread their
conquests and their kingdom into Mesopotamia and even to the shores of
the Medit terranean.
Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when he includes
Northern Mesopotamia, together with the mountainous country of Ararat,
under the name of Armenia, and in writing of the Armenian boats that
brought merchandise to Babylon, he remarks that they were constructed in
Armenia, in the parts above Assyria.
Archaeological researches have laid the claim that the modern Armenians
are the descendants of the old Hittites ; the modern Armenian being supposed
