the skull, and capable only of very limited motion : the eye is almost uniformly mild, and the lips
unmoved by passion.
" It is in carnivorous animals, with whose habits and manner of life, ferocity is instinctively
connected, as the great means of their subsistence, that rage is distinguished by the most
remarkable strength of expression. The eye-ball is terrible, and the retraction of the flesh of the
lips indicates the most savage fury. But the first, is merely the exerted attention of the animal

and the other a preparatory exposure of the canine teeth. The great animals of prey-the Lion
and the Tiger-are quite incapable of any other expression of featuré, than this particular display
of ferociousness. When they fawn upon their keeper, there is no motion in their features that

In this assertion, that the countenances of the great
