and humour blended.
There is nothing neater in all the history of
highwaymen than this anecdote, twinkling brightly
amid the matter-of-fact records of a degenerate

There is plentiful evidence that when Captain
Alexander Smith in 1719-20 wrote and publishe
his work upon the highwaymen and other evil-
doers, he based his book upon the n ny chap-

do not mind searching for t
whether
they will repay the troub

Captain Alexander Smith took an immense
delight in his villains. You cannot fail to per-

heart's core of him, he expends his most loving
labours upon the freebooters who displayed his
own political bias, and there can be little doubt
