CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
OF THE PLATES.
THAT there
Engravings of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the prog't
it of Art, is to be regretted The talents
of Mr. JOHN Sco.
If GILPIN, COOPER and the REINAGLES,
have presented the
tions of the distinguished ornaments of the
turf: the sports of
manners of the canille race, were also duly
honoured : but of the
lordly LION, we have nothing extant that
would bear critical if
mints : - nothing like a collection of
figures, whose justne
Macter, and expression, might be
relied on.
Does any reader i
mis's which have been performed-chiefly
abroad-by Artists of no
ered as exceptions? They are not exceptions :
or at best, the number wl
il is but small, and those, for the most part, of
dimensions not accommoda
he cabinet, or the shelf of the library.
But they are not obje
und alone. Speaking of them in the aggregate, the
heavier charge lies against
afficient to those purposes of taste and information
which are the ends of Art. Ever
TITIAN and after RUBENS (the latter of whom has
perhaps painted a greater number than
er of the old masters) are far more deficient in
form, character, and expression, than is generally supposed, or than will be easily believed, by
those who have not actually compared them with the Lions, Leopards, and Tigers of Nature.
They have been taken too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
- -Nor is this intended to impugn the merits, as historical or poetical painters, of those distinguished
Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that as a painter of allegory, RUBENS
might consider that strong infusion of human form, character, and expression, by which his Lions,
for example, are distinguished, as necessary, or conducive, to his allegorical purposes: or, it is pos-
sible that his knowledge of this animal may not have been thoroughly well-grounded, and that he
may havi laboured under early prejudice of mind, or of vision, in this part of lis education as a
Painter, and may not have seen Lions as they really are. This is what the writer is most inclined
to believe, (though not to insist) ; for even in treating the subject of Daniel in the den of Lions-
