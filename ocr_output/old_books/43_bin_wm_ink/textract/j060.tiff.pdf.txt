Primitive Methods.-Brieﬂy the primitive process of convert-
ing the rattan, or raw material, into cane and reeds, or the finished
product, is this: The rattan stems are thoroly dried or seasoned,
and the nodules are pared off with a peculiar native knife. hen the
rattan is sorted into sizes and selection made as to grade.
he sort-
ing is based upon exter color and diameter of the rattan. The
rattan is then immero
and the stem is rubbed vigorously
with sand and coc
nove dirt and foreign substances.
It is then bleache

These are rounded by

perforated with holes
ters. The rounded cores
are called reeds.
Considerable rattan is still
into the finished products
by hand processes thru these la
stages. Machines have been
perfected which do practically
ntire work. Particularly have
the Germans brought this to a perfected state. Still in
various sections of India, China and the Philippines hand working
of rattan is a thriving industry an industry seemingly peculiarly
adapted to the natives. The Philippine method of preparing the
raw material varies somewhat from the Chinese method in that the
natives do not bleach the rattan.
Reed may be procured in large or small hanks, in coils and in
bundles, with the cost determined by weight. Schools generally
will find it advantageous to buy it in small hanks, because of ease in
handling and for economic reasons. Round reeds are shown
three-fourths size in Fig. 49, from No. o to and including No. 7,
also winding, half-round and flat reeds. Winding reed is thin and
