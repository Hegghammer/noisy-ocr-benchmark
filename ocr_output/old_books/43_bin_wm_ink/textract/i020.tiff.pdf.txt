THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
Friday noon (May 7) we made only 462 miles.
This was partly accounted for by the fact that
we picked up Greenwich time at Cape Clear
O
and put the clock ahead 1 hour and 40
minutes.
The reason this small run impressed itself
upon my mind was that I expected that
yhen we sighted the Irish Coast the "Lucy"
buld show a burst of "top speed" and that
should go flying up at not less than 25
hour. The run up to Thursday noon
d been 484 miles, and so confident
would put on steam that I
gh number in the pool (for
was 499. It was the only pool
d I couldn't help it, for the
0 and at that price it
