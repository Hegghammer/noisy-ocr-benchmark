WHY AND WHEREFORE.
In making a study of my race, Ihave found three marked characteristics
X
Intelligence-Energy-Industry. Combined with these three characteristics
is an intense Love of Nationality. We live in a complex world. In an
independent people these characteristics and this sentiment are laudable
Virtues. In a subject people they are Crimes.
After I had laid this bitter Truth to heart, I did not have to seek for the
Why a
The
Mel in history. The
human mind S.
rgies of which they have
been the victims,
a
horrors : and this helpless
christian people are to
dly peril as they have been since
the famous Treaty of Ber
them bound hand and foot to the
mercy of their executioners.
The Armenians may
to the slaughter" and the
work of extermination n
eted-Jesus Christ was crucified on
Calvary and the serva
greater than his Lord-but the work of their
extermination can
completed when the evil influences in the Turkish
Empire have
ened their culminating point. Hitherto the Powers of
Europe have by their jealousies and rivalries cultivated these evil influences,
they have watered them and made them grow, but when their culminating
point is reached, they must re-act on Christendom and the natural
consequence must follow. Those who SOW the wind, must reap the whirl-
wind. It is in the natural order of things.
1 will allow that Liberty, Justice, Equality, Fraternity are the watchwords
of Young Turkey, but Young Turkey is only a small minority ; the great
majority of the Turkish nation are not Young Turks.
The question therefore resolves itself into this critical point : "What will
Christendom do even now?'
