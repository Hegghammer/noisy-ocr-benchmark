CHAPTER VII
SEATS OF REEDS AND SPLINTS
The discussion of the weaving processe to follo is confined,
in the main, to stools or seats. Fig. 53 shows sever stools different
in design both in wood construction and in we Ing. In two in-
stances it will be noted that weaving is done O
a separate frame,
one being inserted between the rails, the
er fastened on top,
leaving a little projection. Reference is de to several possible
weaving designs and the use of various
nums and combinations.
The possible combinations of mater
are merely suggestive of
possible other ones, and the in divid
vorker will find that many
designs of varying C
lexity
n
worked out. An excellent
method for working
Igns is that of using black and
white paper strips
The design will show up very
clearly because of
of the black and white. Experi-
menting with the
ne seat itself is rather tedious and
unsatisfactory.
strips are an excellent means to an end.
The stool top
ed in Fig. 54 employs a simple over-and-
under weave, u,
flat reed. The worker needs to decide at
the outset on
faracter of weave to be used unless it be of
unusual design
h this instance the weaver runs over three and
under three S nds, and the wrapping done in a series of three.
To begin the peration tack an end of flat reed under a short rail
at a corner, then bring the strand out and over the rail, across the
frame opening to the opposite rail, under this rail, across under-
neath the frame opening to the bottom of the first rail. This com-
pletes the process once around. Repeat three times; then wrap the
strand around the two rails, without running it across the top.
Thus every fourth strand across the top is omitted. It is not
necessary to cut the strand the wrapping is continuous. Repeat
