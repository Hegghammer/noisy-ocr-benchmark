CHAPTER VI
REED AND SPLINT WEAVING
Reeds which are used extensively for bask I-making and weaving
in general are procured from the species
IIm described in Chap-
ter I. These reeds should not be
fed with the term reed
applied to several distinct specia
ge water loving grasses.
Such reeds are usually designa
he name grasses. There
are a thousand species of
ed tropical regions
of the entire world, bu
natiy m the United States,
and these are of ne
al
The rattan or cane
palms of India
da
ow to an unusual height,
and are im
reat quantities. These rat-
tans an
Decies Calamus have as main
exp
utta. These palms are stripped
round and flat strips of different
widths.
uter bark, when stripped into proper
sizes, is known as chair
; the entire palm, with leaves removed,
is commercially know
rattan and the flat reeds are frequently
sold as flat rattan a
(th cane. Inasmuch as these flat and round
strips, split from
palm plant and exported under the name of
rattan are called ceds, we shall refer to them under that name in
all discussions follow. There are two qualities of reed on the
market sold der the names of China reed and German reed. The
former is inferior in quality and the latter is superior, being strong,
tough and durable. The Philippine Islands give promise of pro-
ducing a liberal supply of reed of good quality that is claimed to
equal the German product. The problem, however, is one of gath-
ering and marketing the product. The government has made a
partial survey of the rattan supply, and this justifies the belief that
the Islands will eventually compete with the world market.
