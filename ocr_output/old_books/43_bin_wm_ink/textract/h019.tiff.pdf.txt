and genealogy of the early settlers of Southold-cxamining all the deeds and wills,
and other authentic documents to be found, and also copying the inscriptions from
every headstone, not only in Southold, but over nearly the whole Island-makes it
very evident that some of those named were not there at so early a date, and he
also says that Peter Hallock, who is named as one of the thirteen, was the grandson
of the Puritan Hallock who settled at Southold, and whose Christian name was
William. Mr. Moore is one of the best genealogists of the country, and in relation
to Long Island, he is the best authority extant.
MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE.
Il be seen by the engraving that the old house is double.
The
wes
part is that which was built by Barnabas in 1659 6o. The
east
story part was built by Jonathan I., about 1682. The upper
room
part was used for a court-house for nearly twenty years,

all born in it except Barnabas I., and son Jonathan. We may go
to the castles and palaces of the old WON and search long and dili-

With a few repairs, the old castle may yet stand for generations far
in the future.
It requires some thought and reflection to realize the lapse of time
since the old house was built. See the old Puritan himself there
