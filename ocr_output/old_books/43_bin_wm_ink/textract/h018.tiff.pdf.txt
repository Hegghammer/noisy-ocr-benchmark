Proface.-Introduction.
It is said that Barnabas Horton I. was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities.
His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years b by Jonathan G. Horton.
It is elevated about eighteen inch ne ground, on a good stone
base. The original base
it had all crumbled down
many years ago:
put under the stone at the
time it was re-lette.
orton.
The inscription sur
of the stone, and reads as
follows
"Here lieth buried the body of MR.
HORTON who was born at
Mousely, Leicestershire, Old England, and
l, on the 13th day of
July, 1680, aged 8o years."
In the centre of the stone we find t)
ph, as follows :
" Here lies my body tomb
'Till Christ shall come to
vith the just ;
My soul ascended to the th
God,
Where with sweet Tesus nov
ke abode :
Then hasten after me, my de
wife,
To be partaker of this blessed
And you, dear children, all foll the Lord,
Hear and obey His public sacred ord;
And in your houses call upon His lame,
For oft I have advised you to the same:
Then God will bless you with your children all,
And to this blessed place He will you call."
Heb. xi : 4 " He being dead, yet speaketh."
It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the original
thirteen who brought his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and memory
should not perish from the earth.
