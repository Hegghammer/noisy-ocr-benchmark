That the Armenians should be constantly appealing to the Power that
had pledged itself for their protection, and that the same Power should be
constantly rallying the others, and making Ambassadorial demonstrations,
was enough to rouse the vilest passions of a nature in which no feelings
except vile passions existed.
Of all sins in this world, perhaps the sin of foolishness receives the
severest punishment and of all crimes, the crime of failure meets with the
heaviest doom. For heir f lishness in trusting in European protection
and hoping for Europa
intion the unfortunate Armenians paid with
rivers of their own bld
r their crime of failure they were made to
wallow in that blood.
T
ges of their history have been written
in the closing years of the
the early years of the twentieth
century ; never since the lo
ence, nine centuries ago, had
they hoped for so much, and
so dearly for their folly.
If they had carefully laid
history of Europe's inter-
course with Asia, beginning with
Macedonian Alexander;
they would have read in the light
t, self-interest, and self-
interest only written on every line
page
committed the folly of
GENERAL
GOUKASSOFF.
Relieved the ber ered Russian garrison
at Bayazid during the usso-Turkish war of
1877, captured the for ; and otherwise
distinguished himself during the war.
The other Armenian General who dis-
tinguished himself during the Russo-Turkish
war was General Lazaroff.
