THE ZONE
Avert Thy gaze, O God, close tight Thire eyes!
am,
turn
heir souls
Kel
rity
That
give,
And p
not when
To paus
crifice
Restra
Id keep Thine hand in
S
ot, no
cely thrust without the pale
ose who candare to strew the ocean waste
With fello W creatures, innocent of wrong.
Forget the studied purpose to destroy;
The launching of the missile through the deep;
Theshattered hull; the crushed and bleeding forms;
The seething swirl of wreckage, women, men.
