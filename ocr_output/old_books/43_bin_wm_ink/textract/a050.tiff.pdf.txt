two, the wall of iron that rises between them is the position of woman. The
Armenian has accepted whole-heartedly the position in which woman has
been placed by the Great Founder of his faith. For seventeen hundred
years unremittingly since Christianity was revived in Armenia by Gregory
th Illuminator, the Christian law with regard to the position of woman has
mo ulded the thought of the nation, it has left its impress on the nation, and
it is this vital and essential difference between the law of Mahommed and the
law of Christ that like a two-edged sword has cleaved apart Christian
from Moslem Turk and Persian.

East is East, and West is West" it is on iccount of the social plane

Ich woman stands, a social plane that is never so degraded in any
corne of Asia, as it is in the countries where the law of Mahommed governs.
I Armenians in Asiatic Turkey are scattered and dispersed among
Turks

world as Ri

fetters Ha

toward which,
g and torn, we have been striving, and still are striving?
These are quel
which we must ask ourselves ; looking them soberly in

ity, we must lod
to ourselves, we must search out and probe our national
failings and our
nal weaknesses, and find out in what essential character-
istics we are wa

us weigh ourselv in the balance, and supply what in us is found wanting.
In the period of less than a decade a Great Power has risen in the
Orient. The people of a small island empire with an empty Treasury have
beaten successfully and disastrously a colossal empire of whom the Powers
of Europe had stood in awe, and against whom not one had ventured single-
handed to engage.
