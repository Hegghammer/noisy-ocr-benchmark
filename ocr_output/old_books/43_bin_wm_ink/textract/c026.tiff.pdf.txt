went in and stood on the floor of our house my
heart was thumping within me at the thought of
what was before.
And there was the pot boiling over the fire with
a few green herbs in it. There was Saba my
mother, stirring the last handful of mea. amongst
the green herbs. And there were my brothers,
all older than I, sitting by the fire, waiting for
herbs and the meal to be ready.
my mother looked toward us she saw the

some crim

She and my br

were poor, and th

"Good fortune has com

your son with me as an apprentice, and I shall
instruct him in arts and crafts and mysteries."
My mother said, "The boy is young, sir, and we
thought he would be with us for a time longer."
