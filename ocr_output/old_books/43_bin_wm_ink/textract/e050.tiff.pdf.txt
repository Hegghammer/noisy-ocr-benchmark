THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.
British Museum bears on it the strange and anomalous figure represented
in the annexed illustration. Opinions vary somewhat as to whether
its origin might not have been Italian, but we see no reason for adopting
this view, and consider it as of decidedly home production. It will be
seen that the shoulder, upper part of the arm, and figure are those of a
well-formed female, who wears an unmistakable corset, tightly laced, and
stiffened by two busks in front, from one of which the lace with a tag
at the end, depends. The head, wings, tail, feet, and claws are all those

knots in it requisite to prevent dragging on the ground. The ing held
in the left claw is of gold and probably intended to ren nt a massive

practised by the ladies even in early times, and especially by such
of them as were inclined to be corpulent." He then, in order to
