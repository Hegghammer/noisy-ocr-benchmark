DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE.
I have thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested witnesses.
" We are having a perfectly hideous time here. Thousands have been murdered-2
000
in this province they say ; but the number is probalyly greater, for every Christian village
was wiped out In Adana about 5000 have perisled. After Turks and Armenians had
made peace, the Turks eame in the night with hose ai kerosene. and set fire to what remained
of the Armenian quarter. Next day the French and Ar phian schools were fired. Nearly every-
one in the Armenian school perished, anybody trying t seape being shot down by thesoldiers.
" The Turkish Authorities do nothing except arrel
(noffending Armenians, from whoni
by torture they extort the most fanciful confessions.

their injustice. A man was being carried in to me yes

For fiends incarnate commend me to the Turks.

" The authorities did nothing, and the soldiers wer
han the crowd, for they were
better armed. One house in our quarter was burned
people inside. We counted
the bodies. The soldiers set fire to the door, and
lows had iron bars, nobody

They were all women and
children and old neople."-Extraet from letter of N°
Vylie, wife of British Consul
at Adana ; published in the London Daily Mail
IN THIS HOUSE 115 WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ROASTED ALIVE.
History repeats itself. In 1895 Turkish soldiers fell upon seventy to eighty young
women and girls in a church, where they had fled for refuge, and after hidcously outraging
them, barricaded them in, setting fire to the building at the same time, and derisively shouting
to their victims as they were being roasted alive, to call upon their Christ to save them now
