Remember that they know not what they
Who strike in deadly fear and ghastly hat
Remember that somehow, and at some tit
Each crime exacts its human penalty.
Remember that man's conscience and ma
Are agents of Thy purpose and Thy plar
Which work within a deadlier revenge
Than any shrapnel shot or sabre thrust.
Remember that new generations come
Upon whom fall the burden and the cui e,
The anguish of old hatreds and past WI
The crushing debt, the struggle and de pair.
Restrain, O God, the sweep of this vast hate;
Recall the nations to their sense of shame:
To those in blinding war, to us at peace,
Reveal anew the message of the Christ.
