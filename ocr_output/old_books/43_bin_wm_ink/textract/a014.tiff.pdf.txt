The trouble
beg
ghtened and augmented by soldiers
fell in overwhell
tians. The Armenian population of
Antioch
ad the Armenian villages in the
Alexa
e. Hadjim, Kessab and the neigh-
Tarsus was ruined and ill-omened
hians. Zeitoon was desolated. The
entire population of Kirikon between Aleppo and Alexandretta were massacred to the last
habe. The mob and the soldiers burned what they could not carry away, so that the material
loss has been enormous. In place of the former abundance and thriving industries there are
instead desolated provinces and the charred and blackened remains of pillaged and ruined
homes, and the residue of those who escaped massacre are reduced to homelessness and
starvation.
