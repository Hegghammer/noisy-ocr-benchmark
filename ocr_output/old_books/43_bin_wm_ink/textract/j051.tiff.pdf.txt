The strand is twisted as the weaving progress
done with the palm of the hand and thigh, in much
ner as a shoemaker waxes his thread. If one leaf of rush
make the strand, new leaves are added by tying the two em
square knot at a corner, or wherever such joining will not show
the finished seat. When more than one piece of rush is used for a
strand the pieces should be of uneven lengths initially. One leaf or
piece at a time is then added. The upper or top end of the leaf is
used to begin the seating and each leaf added is attached at its top
end.
Some expert rush seaters do not tie knots in making strands, but
add leaves by twisting the end of the preceding leaf about the added
one, "like the color on a barber pole," as one old rush weaver re-
marked. Adding by twisting only is difficult, and requires great
patience and dextrous handling of the material. In fact rush
should be used by the more skilful boys only. Others may use the
excellent substitute, fiber.
