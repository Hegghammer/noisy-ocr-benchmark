Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engage in
commierce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase the value of
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few ainong them justly started an agitation, these our noble
and industrious brethren were being massacred. What a terrible scene! When

left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our Armenian compatriots being
removed in manure carts; legs and arms were down outside. This bloody scene will
ever remain impressed on my mind.

This article of the Tureish officer, who however does not dare disclose
