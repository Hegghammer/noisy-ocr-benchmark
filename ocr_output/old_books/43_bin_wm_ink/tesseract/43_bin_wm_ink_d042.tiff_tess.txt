28 THE CHILD OF THE MOAT

They were almost too excited to sleep and Aline, as
her custom was, when she lay awake, amused herself
by building castles in the air. Sometimes she would
imagine herself as a great lady, sought after by all th:
noble knights of the land, but holding herself aloof wii
reserved dignity until one, by some deed of unusual
distinction, should win her favour. As a rule, however
this seemed g@ither a dull part to play, though there was
somethin rally queenly in her nature, and she
would therefo efer something more active. She
would take the omance of Burd Helen, or
Burd Aline, a on, and follow her
knight in the ountain and
torrent and thro Yr suited
the romantic sel by
its imaginary dee just as much
to her sense of e: â€˜Lo-night had opened vistas
0 she pictured her knight and her-
self fleeing c= host of.enemies and miraculously
disappearing at the critical moment into the secret room.
But at last she fell into a sound slumber and did not
wake till it was nearly time for the morning meal.
