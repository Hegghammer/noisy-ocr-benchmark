‘Church, but was also a fearless patriot—a distinguished linguist, an eloquent preacher, and a
thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the feared fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history,

At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantiiaple,
by Monseigneur Nereés, the Patriarch, their object heing to request the signatory Powers of
the Berlin Treaty to foree a guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.

Abdul Hamid and his advisers were furious at this affront, and Monseigneur Nercés was
summoned to the Palace. It is said that when he received the summons he simply smiled
and asked one of of his curates to read thasBurial Service to him, as lie did not expect to
return alive. However, he went. No on ever heard what passed bety the Sultan
and himself at the interview; suffice it to sa immediately summoned the Armenian
General Assembly and tendered his resignatiot ee not accepted by the Assembly,
and, amidst enthusiastie cheers, he was carried hd ‘ccments at the Patriarchate.
Meanwhile x peremptory order reached him, sign an, fo reeall the Armenian
delegation from Berlin. ‘This Monseigneur Varjabé 1k refused to do, and retired
to his private residence at Haskeuy, « village on t . ‘The suceess of the dele-
gation, however, did not come up to his expectations. The A ns, as it happened, could
not be heard, but they were so far successful as to have an artie srted in the treaty.

The Sultan and his advisers never forgave the Patviareh thWjhough they could not
openly do anything to him on account of his enormous popularity. e passed on, and to
all appearance the incident was forgotten, but it was not so. One sulNjQer afternoon a most
cordial invitation was sent by a very high dignitary of the Palace, requd@{ng the Arehhishop
to dine with him informally, An invitation of this kind could not very ell be refused, so :
the Archbishop, aceompanied only hy a body-servant named Vartan, repai%l to the Pasha’s
house. The Pasha received him at the door aud eseorted the visitor with muQb ceremony and
extreme courtesy to a private apartment of the salamlik of his house (the m\n’s quarters),
where dinner was served. The geniality displayed by his host dispelled any Mars that the
Archbishop might have had as to his personal safety.

After dinner, as usual, cofiee was served. Now, this serving of the coffee K rather a
ceremonial accdrding to high Turkish etiquette, and it is not unusal for guests to bring their
own ichooboukdar (the servant who carries his master’s pipe and pouch snd also superintends
the making of his ecoftee). The Archbishop was presented with a “ tehoobouk ” (pipe) filled
and lighted for smoking, and a servant followed with coffee. ‘The Archbishop accepted hoth
with due compli to his host, and took a sip at his coffee. Just at that moment the

avy curtains over the doorway were thrown apart, revealing the ghastly pale face of his
servant Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, in a yoice trembling with emotion, “ Monseigneur,
I did not brew the coftee!”

This was enough for the Archbishop ; he pretended to he startled and spilt the coffee, but,
alas! he had already drunk a small quantity of it. Meanwhile a seuille was goig on behind
the portitre, where his poor servant Vartan was paying the penalty of his devotion to his

the Pusha for his generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily summoned. The Patriarch took to his hed,
and lost all his hair through the effects of the poison. Then, one morning, when a servant
