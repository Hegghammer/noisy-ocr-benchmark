right consistent, the reed will dry rapidly and the color will be
sharp and clea om muddy effects.

A woven artic basket or woven top footstool may be

Other Materials.— Reed is good medium adapted
to weaving, either in correlatio when used alone.
On the stools itlustrated several other M7 pave been used,

rope, and even willow may be utilized with success. Paper fiber
was discussed in detail in Chapter V and needs no elaboration.
Fig. 60 shows a stool partly woven with this serviceable material.
Sufficient to say that this fiber adapts itself admirably to almost
all work where reed is commonly employed, and in many instances
is, commercially, supplanting reed.

Inner hickory bark may be obtained of manufacturers of rustic
furniture either directly or indirectly. ‘They may be obtained first
hand if hickory trees grow in the locality, thus enhancing the edu-
cational value of weaving. In the spring or early summer when
the sap is up and the bark slips easily, a hickory tree may be cut
down, and the rough outer bark shaved with a draw knife from
