VIII Preface.—Introduction.

than over a half a century; and lastly Jonathan G. Horton, about a
half a century; making in all two hundred and thirteen years at the
death of Jonathan G. Horton, 3 July, 1873. These six generations
all living and dying in the old mansion! Could those old walls re-
echo all the words ever spoken there, and exhibit anew all the scenes
ever witnessed there—the book containing such a record would vas
exceed in volume the size of the old castle. It would bring t t
much that is now in darkness, and must forever remain hi rom
the generations of the living.

At the death of Jonathan G. Horton, the old h yecame,
by will, the property of the Rev. Mrs. Williams klyn, N. Y.,
who was the adopted daughter of Jonath yrton, he 3
having had issue, so that on the 3d of = old homestead
went out of the Horton name.

Mrs. Williams proposes to se Bue of the Hortons do
not buy it, it will indicate a respect for the old castle,
if not for the Horton id be bought back into the
Horton name, suitah preserved for the wonder and
admiration of gi ortons yet unborn. Jonathan G.
Horton, the g and Stuart ‘l’, Terry, are the two men
seen in t nt of the old house.

, Mr. Stuart T. , of Southold, L. I., has kindly copied and for-
warded to me, many interesting facts from the New Haven Colonial
Records, some of which are here inserted :

“Concerning some farmers neere Southold, at a place called Hash-
amamock, aboute whom Barnapgas Horton, one of ye Constables last

~ yeare, which was 1656, also, Constable in 1659. 29 May, 166x, Bar-
nabas Horton was a Deputy to the New Haven Court—also, 31 May,
1654, the Deputies from Southold, presented to ye court a wrighting
from their towne, wherein it is desired that BARNABAS Horton and
JoHN PEAK the two present Deputies of Southold, may be chosen
Constables for that plantation; which was done. Barnabas Horton
was a Deputy to the Court in Néw Haven, in 1654—’56—’ 58-59 and
1661. In 1655 there was no election, but he wrote a letter to the
Court on public affairs. In 1662 he was admitted a Freeman of Con-
necticut Colony, at Harford, and in 1663 and 1664 he was a Deputy
