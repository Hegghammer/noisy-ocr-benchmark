victims in thy Yildiz Kiosk, found its way to thy treacherous heart. No
poisoned cup of coffee like the countless cups brewed in thy palaces trickled
down thy throat to end thy vampire existence.

Thou hast lived! Protected from the Nemesis of thy crimes by the
jealousies and rivalries of great powers which thou artfully played one against
another ; by the combined forces of religion and plunder which thou cunning]
wielded into one. Even so thou livest! Peerless living example in the
civilized twentieth century of the Triumph of Crime.

Lâ€™AVENIR.

In the foregoing pages I have directed my ts h out
what the Powers of Europe have done in thy ctions
have reflected on my unfortunate race.

It is considered good policy now b rriters
to ascribe all the horrors of the Arm espot,
to represent him as a tyrant as ung le was
implacable, in short as a sort ything
before him to the consummat, on for
this is not difficult to perc Europe
has played in the traged rts successfully 1 ssary
also to present Turke re world now as a paradise ( e the
tyrant once removegPpeopled only by saints and angels; so also
many roseate col#ed word pictures of Constitutional Turkey.

The murders, deportations and imprisonments of the Turkis volu-
tionaries, or more correctly reformers, were undoubtedly the sole k of
Abdul Hamid and his palace clique, but Abdul and his minions co not
have carried out that hellish work of wholesale extermination the
Armenians thout the perpetration and participation of the Tijkish
people. It is true the massacres were originated and organized if the
Palace, the Palace clique stirred up religious fanaticism and race hatred but
the co-operation of the people was necessary ; and the people co-operated
in order to plunder and enrich themselves with the worldly goods that the
Armenians always knew how to acquire by their own industry and toil; the
appeal to their marauding and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
