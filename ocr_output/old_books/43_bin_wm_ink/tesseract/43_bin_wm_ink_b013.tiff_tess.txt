. CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
SOF THE PLATES.

Tat there Eneravings of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the prog’ tof Art, is to he regretied. The talents
of Mr. Joun Sco’ f GitPIN, Cooper, and the RErnaGLEs,
have presented the' ions of the distinguished ts of the
turf: the sports of manners of the canine race, were also duly
honoured: but of th lordly Lion, we have nothing extant that
would bear critical i ants :—nothing like a collection of
figures, whose justnel facter, and expression, might be
relied on. :

Does any reader } hg’s which have been performed—chiefly
abroad—by Artists of no ed as exceptions? They are not exceptions:
or at best, the number w is but small, and those, for the most part, of
dimensions not accommodi 1e cabinet, or the shelf of the library.

But they are not obje nd alone. Speaking of them in the aggregate, the
heavier charge lies against ficient to those purposes of taste and information
which are the ends of Art. Eve Trrran and after Rupens (the latter of whom has
perhaps painted a greater number than’ rc of the old masters) are far more deficient in
form, character, and expression, than is genera upposed, or than will be easily believed, by
those who have not actually compared them with the Lions, Leopards, and Tigers of Nature.
They have been taken too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
—Nor is this intended to impugn the merits, as historical or poetical painters, of those distinguished
Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that as a painter of allegory, RubENs
might consider that strong infusion of human form, character, and expression, by which his Lions,
for exainple, are distinguished, as necessary, or conducive, to his allegorical purposes ; or, it is pos-
sible that his knowledge of this animal may not have been thoroughly well-grounded, and that he

nay have laboured under early prejudice of mind, or of vision, in this part of his education as a
Painter, and may not have seen Lions as they really are. This is what the writer is most inclined
to believe, (though not to insist); for even in treating the subject of Daniel in the den of Lions—
