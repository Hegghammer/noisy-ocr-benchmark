PROLOGUE
THE HORSES OF KING MANUS
As for the youth who had tried to steal the white
horse that the King owned, he was bound hand
and foot and taken into the castle of the King.
There he was thrown down beside the trestles of
the great table, and the hot wax from the candles
that lighted the supper board dripped down upon
nd it was told to him that at the morrowâ€™s
would be slain with the sword.

King called upon one to finish the
story as being told when the neigh of
the whi e was heard in the stable. The
story could n@ be finished for him, however,
because the one w ad been telling it was now
outside, guarding the irdwdoor of the stable with
a sword in his hand. And Kung Manus, sitting
at the supper board, could not Sat nor refresh
himself because there was no one at haft_to finish
the story for him.
