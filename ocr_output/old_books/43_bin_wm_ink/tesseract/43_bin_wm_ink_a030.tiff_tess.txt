The efforts of the Armenians, and the entreaties of their Patriarch
Nerses had procured the insertion of Article 16 in the Treaty of San
Stefano signed between Russia and Turley in March 1878. In fact the
wording of the Article had been suggest{™\ by the Patriarch himself It
provided the following stipulation for the pjM&ction of the Armenians :—

“As the evacuation by the Russian t of the territory which they
now occupy in Armenia, and which is to b red to Turkey, might give
rise to conflicts and complications detri: o the maintenance of good
relations between the two countries, the orie engages to carry into
effect without further delay the improv | reforms demanded by
loc . in the provinces inh the Armenians, and to
guarant ssians.””

What follo itish Government of
which Lord Beacon mier, and Lord Salis-
bury Foreign Secretary, on 1 yy of baffling Russian
agerandizement in Turkey. A r own realor fancied interests
would thereby become imperilled, [ng rew in the weight of her power,
and virtually commanded the substitution 0 Treaty of Berlin in lieu of
the Treaty of San Stefano. Thus the substantiaM¥wgrantee of a natural and
immediate protector, both able and desirous of enforcitt he protection which
the Armenians then had in Russia, was taken away, and the security of im-
potent words given in its stead, namely :—

“The Sublime Porte undertakes to carry out without further delay the
improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces
inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the
Circassians and Kurds. It will periodically make known the steps taken to
this effect to the Powers, who will superintend their application.”

“Tt will periodically make knowit the steps taken to this effect to the
fowers, who will superintend their application,” How this last proviso
could furnish food for laughter were it not for the terrible tragedy involved
in it

The insertion of Article 61 in the Treaty of Berlin, granted, or rather
seemingly granted, by the six Powers of Europe, proved in reality, as sub-
sequent events bore out, an instrument of death and torture, It was as if
the reversal of the figures had reversed the possibilities of succour and
protection, and with the death of the Czar Liberator, the last chance of the
Armenians died.

The Turkish Massacres of 1875 and 1876 which led up to the Russo-
Turkish War of 1877 are historical facts too well known to need further
