I will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and relate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
1796 after ruling over Armenia fifty-eight years.

He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his dgminions, and
grew to be so mighty in battle that the neighbouring n s called his
country Aramia and the people were called Aramians names as
Armenia or Armenians being no doubt later corruptions.

The first victory of Aram was over Neuchar king vhom he
took prisoner and put to death, and made a large pary y of the

designated by foreign writers as “a Mople of Semitic race language and
religion, coming from Northern Arafffa and settling in the region between
the ivestern boundaries of Babylonigfand the highlands of Western Asia ”’
were no other than the Hai who ufler their King Aram had spread their

onquests and their kingdom into Mesopotamia and even to the shores of
the Mediterranean.

Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when he includes
Northern Mesopotamia, together with the mountainous country of Ararat,
under the name of Armenia, and in writing of the Armenian boats that
brought merchandise to Babylon, he remarks that they were constructed in
Armenia, 72 the parts abowe Assyria,

Archeological researches have laid the claim that the modern Armenians
