CHAPTER VI
REED AND SPLINT WEAVING
Reeds which are used extensively for baskgf/making and weaving
in general are procured from the species lm described in Chap-
ter I. These reeds should not be d with thYterm reed
applied to several distinct spec] e water Pying grasses.
Such reeds are usually design e name gf grasses. There
are a thousand species of d ovey@me tropical regions
of the entire world, b nati the United States,
and these are of . The rattan or cane
palms of Indi w to an unusual height,
and are i eat quantities. "These rat-
tans a ecies Calamus have as main
ex) tta. These palms are stripped
round and flat strips of different
idths. ter bark, when stripped into proper
sizes, is known as chai F the entire palm, with leaves removed,
is commercially kno rattan; and the flat reeds are frequently
sold as flat rattan th cane. Inasmuch as these flat and round
strips, split from palm plant and exported under the name of
rattan are calleg@ieds, we shall refer to them under that name in
all discussions4 follow. There are two qualities of reed on the
market sold ffder the names of China reed and German reed. The
former is iferior in quality and the latter is superior, being strong,
tough and durable. The Philippine Islands give promise of pro-
ducing a liberal supply of reed of good quality that is claimed to
equal the German product. The problem, however, is one of gath-
ering and marketing the product. The government has made a
partial survey of the rattan supply, and this justifies the belief that
the Islands will eventually compete with the world market.
