XIV Preoface.â€”Iutroduction,

This book is mainly what those who have kindly furnished records
and sketches have made it. The whole has been carefully compiled.
But genealogical works, almost of necessity, contain many errors.
Doubtless this small work has its full share. But wien errors are d
covered, notice thereof should be given, so that a sqcond edition may
be made entirely truthful. Thankful to all who havp generously giv:
their assistance, this work is sent out as a small qdpntribution to the
senealogical literature of the day, and in the hoy that a more tt

extensive book of Horton chronicles may bg issued at no very
dist .
Terry an., 1876.
