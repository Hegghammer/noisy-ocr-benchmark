Preface.—lutroduction. VII
and genealogy of the early settlers of Southold—examining all the deeds and wis,
and other authentic documents to be found, and also copying the inscriptions from
every headstone, not only in Southold, but over nearly the whole Island—makes it
very evident that some of those named were not there at so early a date, and he
also says that Peter Hallock, who is named as one of the thirteen, was the grandson
of the Puritan Hallock who settled at Southold, and whose Christian name was
William. Mr. Moore is one of the best genealogists of the country, and in relation
to Long Island, he is the best authority extant.

MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE.
wll be seen by the engraving that the old house is double. The
we' art is that which was built by Barnabas in 1659-60. The
east tory part was built by Jonathan I., about 1682. The upper
room art was used for a court-house for nearly twenty years,
as we Thompson’s History of Long Island, and some of
the old used when it was a court-house are still preserved.
The old s Jonathan G. Horton, its last Horton occupant,
used to cal | probability the oldest wood house in America.
tI know of house of any kind, stone or brick, now stand-
ing, that ca far as this venerable old mansion. There
were a few hut f Long Island previous to 1640—two or
three it is said d. But the well as those built by
the Puritans, in heir settlement in Southold, soon all
passed away. ny of the first generation buildings
can be found exce remained for the house that Barnabas
-built to survive th¥jme es, and to stand to-day as a noble .
representative of th el two hundred and fifteen years ago.
But the old house st o- only as peering above all others
by its age, but also by ccu It is not very often that we find
two generations of the saJNe name g and dying in the same house—
rarely find three. But here we ha generations in succession, all
bearing the Horton name, living an¥jlying in the same house, and
all born in it except Barnabas I., and son Jonathan. We may go
to the castles and palaces of the old woMd, and search long and dili-
gently, and fail to find a parallel case.
With a few repairs, the old castle may yet stand for generations far
in the future. .

It requires some thought and reflection to realize the lapse of time
since the old house was built. See the old Puritan himself there
twenty years; then his son Jonathan, twenty-eight years; and then
Jonathan, Jr., about sixty years; and next Lawrence and Azs son Jona-
