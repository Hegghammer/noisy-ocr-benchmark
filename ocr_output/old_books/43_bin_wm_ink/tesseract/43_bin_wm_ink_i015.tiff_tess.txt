Remember that they know not what they,
Who strike in deadly fear and ghastly ha
Remember that somehow, and at some ti
Each crime exacts its human penalty.
Remember that man’s conscience and m
Are agents of Thy purpose and Thy play
Which work within a deadlier revenge
Than any shrapnel shot or sabre thrust.
Remember that new generations come
Upon whom fall the burden and the ec .
The anguish of old hatreds and past wings,
The crushing debi, the struggle and de§pair.
Restrain, O God, the sweep of this vast hate;
Recall the nations to their sense of shame:
To those in blinding war, to us at peace,
Reveal anew the message of the Christ.
