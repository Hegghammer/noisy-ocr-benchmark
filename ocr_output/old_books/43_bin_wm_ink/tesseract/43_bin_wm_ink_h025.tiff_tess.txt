The reader will see at a gla the plan of this book. We com-
mence with the Christian nam Then follows the parentage, genea-
logical data, &c., and then theffChristian names of the children and
order of births. In many of fhe early families the exact order of
births cannot be ascertained; Wht it has been approximated as nearly
as possible. The lineage is givgn in connection with the first member
of the family. The Roman nifmerals indicate the order of births.
The sons and daughters of thefold Puritan, Barnahas, constitute the
second generation, but they are]spoken by way of eminence as Joseph
I, Hannah I., &c. The book contains much repetition, but none
too much to make it plain and easy to study.

This little book contains the chronicles of only about one-half of
the Horton families looked up. Those whose genealogical data are
given only in a small part, and those whose correct lineage has not
been satisfactorily ascertained, are not included in this book.
