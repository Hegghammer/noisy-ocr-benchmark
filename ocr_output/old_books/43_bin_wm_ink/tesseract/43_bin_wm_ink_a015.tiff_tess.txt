DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE,
Thave thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested witnesses.

“Weare having a perfectly hideous time here. ‘Thousands have been murdered—25,000
in this provinee they say ; but the number is probahly greater, for every Christian village
was wiped out In Adana about 5000 have perisld. After Turks and Armenians 1
made peace, the Turks came in the night with hose aij kerosene. and set fire to what remained
of the Armenian quarter. Next day the French and Arfjnian schools were fired. Nearly every-
one in the Armenian school perished, anybody trying teeape being shot down by thesoldiers.”

“The Turkish Authorities do nothing except arrefnoffending Armenians, from whom
by torture they extort the most fanciful confessions. the wounded are not safe from
their injustice. .A man was being carried in to me yeg y when lie was seized and taken
off to gaol. I dare not think what his fate may be.

‘For fiends incarnate commend me to the Turks ly is safe from them. They
murder babies in front of their mothers ; they half muy id violate the wives while
the husbands are lying there dying in pools of blood.”

“The authorities did nothing, and the soldiers we han the crowd, for they were .
better armed. One house in our quarter was burned people inside. We counted
the bodies. The soldiers set fire to the door, and ows had iron bars, nobody
could get out. Everybody in the house was. ros Chey were all women and
children and old people.”—Extract from letter of Mi Vylie, wife of British Consul
at Adana; published in the London “ Daily Mail

IN THIS HOUSE 115 WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ROASTED ALIVE.
llistory repeats itself. In 1895 Turkish soldiers fell upon seventy to eighty young
women and girls in a church, where they had fled for refuge, and after hidcously outraging
them, barricaded them in, setting fire to the building at the same time, and derisively shouting
to their victims as they were being roasted alive, to call upon their Christ to save them now
