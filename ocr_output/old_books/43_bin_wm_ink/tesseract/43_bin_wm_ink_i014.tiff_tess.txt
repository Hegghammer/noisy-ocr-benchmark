Avert Thy gaze, O God, c isht Thigfe eyes!

K ity
Tha “IVE,
And not when
To pau rifice
Restr, d keep Thine hand in
ni ely thrust without the pale
Se who ¢ are to strew the ocean waste
7ith fellow creatures, innocent of wrong.
Forget the studied purpose to destroy;
The launching of the missile through the deep;
The shattered hull; the crushed and bleeding forms;
The seething swirl of wreckage, women, men.
