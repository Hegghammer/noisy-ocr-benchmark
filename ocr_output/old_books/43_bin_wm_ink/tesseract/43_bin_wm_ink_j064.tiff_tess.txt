in indefinite lengths must be made pliant by a thoro soaking just
previous to use. In weaving they should be pressed close together
with the fingers or with the aid of a hammer, as there is an appreci-
able shrinkage especially in their width upon drying. Such strips
are used mainly by builders of rustic outdoor and porch furniture
for the weaving of the backs, arms and seats of chairs, and have
at present no general use in school shops. Their use here should
be encouraged. If bought of the manufacturer these strips cost 40
cents per pound, dry. They are put up in coils, and are 34 in. wide
and 1/16 in. thick. They may be stripped into narrower widths
by means of a hand stripper, soon to be described.
