82 Seventh Generation.—Joseph I.

He possesses fine social qualities, and, since retiring from business, he °
occasionally amuses himself in hunting and fishing. His integrity,
industry and great business capacities, during the active part of his
life, rendered him a most valuable acquisition to the community in
which he carried on his business, and the articles he manufactured
were of sterling value to the farming interests of the country.

Mr. Horton, on sending me his photograph for an engraving
accompanied it with the following very modest and unassuming sketc
of his life :

“I was born in Yorktown, Westchester County, New York, 15
September, 1806. My parents were farmers, in moderate circu
stances. I remained with them until I was seventeen, working on th
farm in the summer, and going to school in the winter, thus acquiring
ngerely a common-school education. When I was seventeen years old,
at estion of my parents, I decided to learn the blacksmith
trade, ced the business at once, and served an appren-
ticeship fo n the 17th of October, 1827, I married

Mr. Horton is not a public professor of Christianity, but is a gen-
tleman of correct moral deportment, and very temperate in his habits.
