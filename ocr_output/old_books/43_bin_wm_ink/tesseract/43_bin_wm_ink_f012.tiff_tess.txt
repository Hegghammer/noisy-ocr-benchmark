viii PREFACE
from Smith, who himself was prone to include
* the most extravagant myths in his pages, calls
his Mglio A GENERAL AND TRUE HiIsrory OF
THE ES AND AcTIONS OF THE Most Famous
Hieuy EN. Both of them include pirates and
murdere YP the “truth” of much in Sith
and Joh less said the better. j

No on er reprinted those ors in
their origin vagance, or thg POSSESS.
It would be - and, if » it would
not be entertair has a! er edited
them, or even 2 W history of
the highwaymen. low astonish-
ingly popular th ever been
whieh have had C and Turpin,
and their like for not a little
surprisin,

Perhaps the task h ndoned because
of the diffieulty—ihe al erable difficulty
—of sifting fact from fi d because of a
chilling sense that it woul thankless task
to present the highwayman really was: a
fellow rarely heroic, general ul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. novelist would
be likely to thank the frank histo¥ian for this dis-
service ; and I do not think the historian who came
to the subject im this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
