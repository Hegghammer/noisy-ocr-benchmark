10 THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.

belles of the tribe were not slow in discovering that, when arrayed
iu all the panoply of forest finery, a belt well drawn in, as shown in the
annexed illustration, served to display the figure to much greater adyan- |

by a system of circular a! olding and looping, confines the
waist from just below th e hips as firmly and compactly as
the most unyielding corse present day.

At the period of th¥jW#Wscovery of some of the islands of the
Eastern Archipelago, it was found customary for all young females to
wear a peculiar kind of corset, formed of spirally-arranged rattan
cane, and this, when once put on, was not removed until the celebration
of the marriage ceremony. Such races as were slowly advancing in the

| march of civilisation, after discovery by the early navigators, became
more and more accustomed to the use of clothing, to adjust and retain ;
which, waistbands would become essentially requisite. ‘These, when
made snfficiently broad to fit without undue friction, and stiff enough to
prevent folding together in the act of stooping, sitting, or moving
about, at once became in effect corsets, and suggested to the minds
of the ingenious a system of cutting and fitting so as more perfectly to
adapt them to the figure of the wearer. The modes of fastening, as
we shall see, have been various, from the simple sewing together with
the lace to the costly buckle and jewelled loop and stud.
