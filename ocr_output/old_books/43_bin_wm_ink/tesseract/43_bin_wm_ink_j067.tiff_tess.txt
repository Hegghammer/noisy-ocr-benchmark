CHAPTER VII
SEATS OF REEDS AND SPLINTS

The discussion of the weaving processes to follgff is confined,
in the main, to stools or seats. Fig. 53 shows severgMstools different
in design both in wood construction and in wang. In two in-
stances it will be noted that weaving is don: ra separate frame,
one being inserted between the rails, th fastened on top,
leaving a little projection. Reference i: e to several possible
weaving designs and the use of various ums and combinations.
The possible combinations of mateg@ifire merely suggestive of
possible other ones, and the indivi rorker will find that many
designs of varying ¢ ity worked out. An excellent
method for workin gns is that of using black and
white paper strips The design will show up very
clearly because of f the black and white. Experi-
menting with th e seat itself is rather tedious and
unsatisfactory. stfips are an excellent means to an end.

The stool top ed in Fig. 54 employs a simple over-and-
under weave, u flat reed. ‘The worker needs to decide at
the outset on aracter of weave to be used unless it be of
unusual desi this instance the weaver runs over three and
under three ds, and the wrapping done in a series of three.
To begin theperation tack an end of flat reed under a short rail
at a corner, Phen bring the strand out and over the rail, across the
frame opening to the opposite rail, under this rail, across under-
neath the frame opening to the bottom of the first rail. This com-
pletes the process once around. Repeat three times; then wrap the
strand around the two rails, without running it across the top.
Thus every fourth strand across the top is omitted. It is not
necessary to cut the strand; the wrapping is continuous. Repeat
