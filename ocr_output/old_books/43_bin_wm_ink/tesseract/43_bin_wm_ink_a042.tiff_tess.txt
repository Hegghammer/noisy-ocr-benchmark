last great speech of his heroic life. England attempted some kind of protest. But rather
than join the Liberal demand for action, Lord Rosebery left his party for -private leisure, and
Russia, France, und Germany combined to secure immunity for the “ great assassin.” It
was the lowest point of Surope’s shame.
