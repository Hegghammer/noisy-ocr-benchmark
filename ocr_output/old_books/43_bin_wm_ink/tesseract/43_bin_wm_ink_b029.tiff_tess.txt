CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. ?
an opposite theory, in which instinctive agency is rejected, and the appearances are explained from
a consideration of the necessities and voluntary exertions of the animal. With regard to the
observer, it has been asserted, that it is by experience alone that he distinguishes the signs of the
passions ; that we learn, while infants, to consider smiles as expressions of kindness, because they
are accompanied by acts of beneficence and by endearments; and frowns as the contrary, because
we find them followed by blows ; that the expression of anger in a brute, is only that which has
been observed to precede his biting ; and that of fondness, his fawning and licking of the hand.
With regard to the creature itself, it is said, what has been called the external signs of passion, are
merely the concomitants of those voluntary movements, which the passions or habits suggest ; that

‘the glare of the Lion’s eye, for example, ishe consequence of a voluntary exertion to see his prey
more clearly —his grin, or snarl, the na’ otion of uncasing his faugs before he uses them.
This, however, is not quite true of all of all expression of passion

“ Attending merely to the evid by anatomical investigation, all that I shall
venture to affirm is this: that a re is to be found between the anatomy and
range of expression, in man and i former there seems to be a systematic
provision for that mode of com 1 which is to be read in the
changes of the countenance: f man which has not its
appropriate signs ; and that 110 other use can be
assigned than to serve as t is in the lower
animals no range of expr 0 the voluntary

“There appears to me (continues Mx. BELL) to be no expression in ace of any animal
lower in the scale of being than quadrupeds; and in them the stronge& d most marked
expression is that of rage; the object of which is opposition, resistance, and ence. But on
examination it will be for onsistently with the position, that this is merely accessary of
the motions natural to the accomplishment of the object which the animal has in vy that the
strength of the expression is in exact proportion to the strength of the principal acWn in the
creature when tlius excited.

“The gramniyorous animals, which seek their subsistence, not by preying upon others, Myr by
the ferocity, contest, and victory which supply the carnivorous with food, have in their featureX\no
strong expres of rage. Their expression is chiefly confined indeed to the effect produced on t
general system. the inflamed eye and the breathing nostrils of the Bull, are induced only

y the general excitement. His only proper expression of rage, is in the position of the head,
with the b urned obliquely to the ground, ready to strike: and indeed it may be observed
in general that animals which strike with the horns, shew little indication of fear or rage, except in
