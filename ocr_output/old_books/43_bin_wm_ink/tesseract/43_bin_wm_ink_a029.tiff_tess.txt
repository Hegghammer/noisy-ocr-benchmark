PART IL
TIE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN.

Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the still more famous Treaty
of Bertin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel in history.

In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of Europe,
but in the interests of Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of thg Treaty of Berlin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).

It was a curious irony Fate, that although the taking of ‘the
terrible stronghold of Kars,’ versally admitted to be one of the greatest
and most difficult military s ever achieved, and the crowning success
of the Russian arms in As urkey, should have been accomplished by

nenian General; t ugh Armenian Generals in the Russian
d to conqug Armenian soldiers fought, conquered and
die & succg aly was no amelioration attained of the
hard under Turkish rule, but that fate, hard
before, ven a thousandfold harder.
