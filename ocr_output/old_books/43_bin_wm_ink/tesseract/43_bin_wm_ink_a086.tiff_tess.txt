Illuminator who built the Church in the third century of the Christian era.

The cathedral of Etchmiatzin is identified with Gregory; its name
“*Etchmiatzin’? means in the Armenian language ‘the only begotten is
descended,” and the story attached to it is, that ina vision Christ appeared
to Gregory descended in light; Gregory built his church on the spot where
the vision had appeared to him, giving it the name of “ Etchmiatzin ” (only
begotten descended). The cathedral also gives its name to the town
Etchmiatzin, the ecclesiastical metropolis of Armenia.
