THE LUSITANIA’S LAST VOYAGE

I mean those in the staterooms. I cannot
speak with certainty in regard to the port-
holes on deck E. I believe that the first list
the ship took brought her down to these
open ports on the starboard side and that
she sank much more quickly from filling
thyough them.

y return to the deck I felt tk e
stea. ust make her final plum mo-
ment as there was noj rethat -
could the port there was
no disci to do it—I
passed rd side. Men
were siri e boats and were
putting wo en into them, but it
seemed to only added horror to
the whole s! nm to put people into a
boat that you” knew never would be cleared
and which would go down with the steamer;
better leave them on the deck to let them
take their chance at a piece of wreckage.
