PREFACE
a

Tue subject which we have here treated is a sort of figurative
battle-field, where fierce contests have for ages been from time to time
waged; and, notwithstanding the determined assaults of the attacking
hosts, the contention and its cause remain pretty much as they were at the
commencement of the war. We in the matter remain strictly neutral,

. merely performing the part of the public’s “ own correspondent,” making

it our duty to gather together such extracts from despatches, both ancient
and modern, as may prove intggesting or important, to take note of the
vicissitudes of war, mark i nis phases, and, in fine, to do our best
to lay clearly before ou historical facts—experiences and
arguments—relating t« “ Corset question.”

As most of ou leading journals especially
intended for tl of ladies have many years the media
for the exch of a vast number of let nd papers touching
the use of fle Corset. The questions relatin the history of
this appafntly indispensable article of ladies’ attire, construction,
applicaffon, and influence on the figure have become so num®&ous of late
thayAve have thought, by embodying all that we can glean anW garner

ating to Corsets, their wearers, and the various costumes worn by :
ladies at different periods, arranging the subject-matter in its due order |
as to dates, and at the same time availing ourselves of careful illustration |
when needed, that an interesting volume would result.
