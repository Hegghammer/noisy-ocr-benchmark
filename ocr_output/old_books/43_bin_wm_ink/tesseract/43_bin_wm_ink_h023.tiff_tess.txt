Jeremiah also settled in Massachusetts. ‘There was a John Horton in
New York, in 1645, but no one has been found claiming descent from
him. He probably returned to England.

nabas was not the oldest son, and not inheriting real estate, may have
been one reason for his emigrating to America.

It is known that Capt. Jeremy Horton, 18 Aug., 1626, was the
master and owner of the ship ‘‘ Swad/ow,’’ of Barnstable, and that he
made voyages to New England, in 1633 and 1638, and ina subsequent
voyage hé was shipwrecked and several lives lost—the crew and master
came to Boston, but the vessel was lost.

Capt. Roger Horton, about this time, had a prisoner delivered to
