As for the youth who had tried to steal the white
horse that the King owned, he wa

There he was thrown down beside the trestles of
the great table, and the hot wax from the candles
that lighted the supper board dripped down upon
And it was told to him that at the morrow's
I would be slain w
King called upon one to finish the
story
as being told when the neigh of
the whit e was heard in the stable. The
story could no
be finished for him, however,
because the one who had been telling it was now
outside, guarding the iron door of the stable with
a sword in his hand. And King Manus, sitting
at the supper board, could not eat nor refresh
himself because there was no one at hand to finish
the story for him.
