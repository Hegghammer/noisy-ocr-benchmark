CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

of pace, by which they advance unperceived till within a spring of their prey; as because it is also
the means of that celerity of motion which is necessary to the very existence of animals that can

Their claws are exceedingly powerful; and they are enabled to draw them up into sheaths
between their toes, so as to prevent their points from touching the ground; whence they are
called retractile; and those claws are, in consequence, always kept sharp, unworn, and ready for
ctive service.

ELL treats learnedly, and we believe with much originality, of the facial-muscles of
of quadrupeds, in his "Anatomy of Expression."-We shall offer a few extracts, by
reader will perceive how limited are their powers of expression of countenance, when
pared with those of human nature, notwithstanding their superiority over all other quadrupeds.
"The violent passions mark themselves so distinctly on the countenances both of men and
of animals, that we are apt in the first instance to consider the movements by which they are
indicated, as certain signs or characters provided by Nature, for the express purpose of intimating
the internal emotion; and to suppose that they are interpreted by the observer in consequence of a
peculiar and instinctive faculty. This view of things, however, so natural at first sight, is not
altogether satisfactory to philosophy; and a more jealous observation of the facts, seems to suggest
