CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

Every artist does best, that which he is best qualified and best disposed to do. In com-
pleting the number of plates that has been found necessary for the Work, Mr. EDWIN Landseer
has chosen to proceed toward the same purpose, upon a different principle. He has
gone,
without
any introductory medium, directly to the living animals, and has exhibited the savage manners and
habits of these quadrupeds, according to his own ideas and observations.
On the distinction between CHARACTER and EXPRESSION, we shall now deliver our opinion.
By the Character of an animal, we mean those permanencies of his look and features which he
always offers to view when in a placid, or unimpassioned state by his Expression, the variations
of muscula action superinduced on character, to which he is liable, as the storms of passion sweep
by, and his becomes agitated by external circumstances acting on the ardours of his instinct.

obliterate, chara

their sequestered haunts, as is s n his grand forest back-grounds; and who, generally
speaking, left little or no room for rs to improve, except on some few of his inferi√≥r works.

characterised in his countenance, and we might ask, in the language of Job, "Who shall dare to
