earth as other nations? Does Humanity, does Christianity allow that tender
babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and butchered
before the eyes of their mothers, or that the ears of mothers should be rent
with the cries of the dying agony of their murdered children? Does
Humanity, does Christianity allow that helpless women should be forcibly
subjected to the most hideous, the most loathsome, the most revolting, and
the most cruel outrages? Does Humanity, does Christianity, allow all this?
Christian Governments have organized a Hague Conference of Peace
and Civilization, but they have. closed its doors to the cause of a bleeding
christian race groaning under the yoke of the cruellest oppressors that the
world has yet known. Christian men and women have held up their hands
in horror at the Indian Juggernauth; but alas! the political wheels of
Christian Governments have been a Greater Juggernauth for a helpless
christian race.
It is by Christian Governments that we are made as the
filth of the world, and as the offscouring of all things unto this day.‚Äù It is

of Berlin your
blood and tears, as the history of

and
know that the sum total of
your wro

the very hea

and we each one
separate political and
commercial interests in the

not regard you. It may be the
tendom that we
Christian Powers should be a gathered

Empire of your Oppressors s eagles gather

really there is no help for and if you must die
a hellish
extermination, why then you must die, and we have to com
hellish
extermination, for in any ase, each one of us must secure his litical
and commercial interests in this same Empire of your Oppressors.

there occurs in the chapter entitled "Some Political Reflections" the follow-
ing passage:
"The attention of the West was so much drawn towards Herzegovina
and Bulgaria by the events of 1876 that the miseries of the Asiatic subjects
