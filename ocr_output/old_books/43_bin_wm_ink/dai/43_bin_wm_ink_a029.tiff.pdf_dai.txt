PART I.
THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN,
Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the still more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel in history.
In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of Europe,
but in the interests of Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).
It was a curious irony Fate, that although the taking of "the
terrible stronghold of Kars,' versally admitted

of the Russian arms in As urkey, should have been accomplished by
Armenian General; t' ough Armenian Generals in the Russian

by Alexander II. The liberal policy which
char ed the reign of that excellent monarch, and
the Contion that he was on the eve of granting to
his people were influenced by Melikoff; but after the
death of Alexander II he was not allowed to continue in
his good work of reforming Russia, being overthrown
from office early in the reign of Alexander III.
