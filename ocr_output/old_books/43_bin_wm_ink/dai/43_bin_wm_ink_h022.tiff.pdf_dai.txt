about eight or ten inches of the muzzle cut off.
The CASK, in which he packed a portion of his household goods,
and brought over with him, is still in existence, and is owned by
Gilbert W. Horton, of Bay View, Southold. It is doubly historic
from the fact that when the British invaded Long Island it was filled
with wheat and buried, thus securing the wheat from the foraging
