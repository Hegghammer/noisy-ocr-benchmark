THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE

speak with certainty in regard to the port-
holes on deck E. I believe that the first list
the ship took brought her down to these
open ports on the starboard side and that
she sank much more quickly from filling
through them.
O my return to the deck I felt theme
stea ust make her final plung mo-
ment
as there was not
ore that
could
the port
there was
to do it-I
passed t
ard side. Men
were stri
e boats and were
putting wo
ren into them, but it
seemed to
only added horror to
the whole si on to put people into a
boat that you knew never would be cleared
and which would go down with the steamer;
better leave them on the deck to let them
take their chance at a piece of wreckage.
