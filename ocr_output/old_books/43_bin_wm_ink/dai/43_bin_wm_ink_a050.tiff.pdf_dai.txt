wo, the wall of iron that rises between them is the position of woman. The
Armenian has accepted whole-heartedly the position in which woman has
been placed by the Great Founder of his faith. For seventeen hundred
years unremittingly since Christianity was revived in Armenia by Gregory
the Illuminator, the Christian law with regard to the position of woman has
moulded the thought of the nation, it has left its impress on the nation, and
it is this vital and essential difference between the law of Mahommed and the
law of Christ that like a two-edged sword has cleaved apart Christian
Armenian from Moslem Turk and Persian.
East is East, and West is West” it is on account of the social plane
on wch woman stands, a social plane that is never so degraded in any
corne of Asia, as it is in the countries where the law of Mahommed governs.
Te Armenians in Asiatic Turkey are scattered and dispersed among
Turks d other antagonistic races; they are without any military force or
organiz on to wrest autonomy from the military and governing power.
That Epe should aid their endeavours, or that Turkey should make them
a free gf autonomy, are both of them absolutely out of the question.
Then wh emains for us?
To to our own nationality and to be subject-Subject to Russia,
subject to key, subject to Persia-What shall it profit us? What will
it profit?
t doth it profit us? Our strong, clever, energetic men, our
beautiful, i nt women, when neither chance nor opportunity can enable
to reach the higher rungs of the world's ladder, and
when as a
le we must ever remain hewers of wood and drawers
of water, e
asowskis and our Melikoffs have been known to the
world as R
as Armenians. Have we a chance of bursting the
fetters? Ha trength to break the chains? Can we reach the goal
toward which, gand torn, we have been striving, and still are striving?
These are que
which we must ask ourselves; looking them soberly in
the face.
But this is enough: if we must persist in holding to our our national-
ity, we must loo to ourselves, we must search out and probe our national
failings and our mal weaknesses, and find out in what essential character-
istics we are wai as a nation, and so build up national character. Let
us weigh oursely in the balance, and supply what in us is found wanting.
In the period of less than a decade a Great Power has risen in the
Orient. The people of a small island empire with an empty Treasury have
beaten successfully and disastrously a colossal empire of whom the Powers
of Europe had stood in awe, and against whom not one had ventured single-
handed to engage.
