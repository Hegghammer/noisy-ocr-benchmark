THE CHILD OF THE MOAT
They were almost too excited to sleep and Aline, as
her custom was, when she lay awake, amused herself
by building castles in the air. Sometimes she would
imagine herself as a great lady, sought after by all the
noble knights of the land, but holding herself aloof with
reserved dignity until one, by some deed of unusual
distinction, should win her favour. As a rule, however,
this seemed ther a dull part to play, though there was
something urally queenly in her nature, and she
would therefor prefer something more active. She
would take the
romance of Burd Helen, or
Burd Aline, as
tion, and follow her
knight in the
mountain and
torrent and throu
ter suited
the romantic self
by
its imaginary deed
ered just as much
to her sense of e.
To-night had opened vistas
of now
she pictured her knight and her-
self fleeing beror
host of enemies and miraculously
disappearing at the critical moment into the secret room.
But at last she fell into a sound slumber and did not
wake till it was nearly time for the morning meal.
