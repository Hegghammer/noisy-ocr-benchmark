CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

the skull, and capable only of very limited motion: the eye is almost uniformly mild, and the lips
unmoved by passion.
"It is in carnivorous animals, with whose habits and manner of life, ferocity is instinctively
connected, as the great means of their subsistence, that rage is distinguished by the most
remarkable strength of expression. The eye-ball is terrible, and the retraction of the flesh of the
lips indicates the most savage fury. But the first, is merely the exerted attention of the animal;
and the other a preparatory exposure of the canine teeth. The great animals of prey-the Lion
and the Tiger-are quite incapable of any other expression of feature, than this particular display
of ferociousness. When they fawn upon their keeper, there is no motion in their features that
indicates affection."
In this assertion, that the countenances of the great

Or what can be said of the circumstance mention ENECA (of which he was personally
witness), of a Lion, to whom a man, who had formerly be his keeper, was exposed for destruction
in the amplitheatre at Rome; and who was not only instantly recognised, but defended and
protected by the grateful beast?-Or of the story related by Dr. SOUTHEY, of the Lion who had
broken loose, submitting to the Cid, and allowing himself to be led back peaceably to his place of
