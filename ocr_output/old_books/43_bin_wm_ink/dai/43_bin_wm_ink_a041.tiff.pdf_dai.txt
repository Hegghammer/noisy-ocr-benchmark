as a poet, wandering far and wide through
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian secti menia, visiting Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his po scenes and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his death, he devoted himself to the building of schools,
which he generously threw open to K, the hereditary assassins of Armenians. For many
years, while Europe was occupied with Crimean wars, Austrian wars, or French and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying from Van to Constantinople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, sacred emblems of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenian patriarch of Constantinople (1869), he was driven from
his office after four years.
But the cup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiless slaughter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more tha even the European Powers could stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to plead his people's cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Europe
beforehand, urging them to create an autonomous neutral state for Armenia, as they had
done with success for the Lebanon. In London he became acquainted with Gladstone; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and,
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey's definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London amid shouts of "Peace with Honor,"
and Armenia was left to stew.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake
