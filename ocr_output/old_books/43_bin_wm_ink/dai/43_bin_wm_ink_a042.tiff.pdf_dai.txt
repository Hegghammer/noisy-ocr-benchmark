and Erzeroum. so found that even among the Georgians there was a large party willing
to concede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian villages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Cancasus wins federal
autonomy. But the majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and industries. One cannot yet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolutionary parties of "The Bell" and "The Flag." Of these,
the Social Democratic "Bell" follows the usual impracticable and pedantic creed of St. Marx.
The "Flag," or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a great
assembly held in Erivan last August (1906) they adopted a programme of land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected laymen. If the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.
Whatever may be the political future of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
