poisoned cup of coffee like the countless cups brewed in thy palaces trickled
down thy throat to end thy vampire existence.
Thou hast lived ! Protected from the Nemesis of thy crimes by the
jealousies and rivalries of great powers which thou artfully played one against

the co-operation of the people was necessary; and the people co-operated
in order to plunder and enrich themselves with the worldly goods that the
Armenians always knew how to acquire by their own industry and toil; the
appeal to their marauding and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
