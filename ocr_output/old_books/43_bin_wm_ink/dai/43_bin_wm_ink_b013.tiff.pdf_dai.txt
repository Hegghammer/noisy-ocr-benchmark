CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
ON OF THE PLATES.

Engravings of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the prog
it of Art, is to be regretted. The talents
of Mr. JOHN SCO
of GILPIN, COOPER, and the REINAGLES,
have presented the
tions of the distinguished ornaments of the
turf: the sports of
manners of the canine race, were also duly
honoured: but of the
lordly LION, we have nothing extant that
would bear critical in

figures, whose justne

Does any reader i

But they are not obje

which are the ends of Art. Even
TITIAN and after RUBENS (the latter of whom has

those who have not actually compared them with the Lions, Leopards, and Tigers of Nature.
They have been taken too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
-Nor is this intended to impugn the merits, as historical or poetical painters, of those distinguished
Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that as a painter of allegory, RUBENS
might consider that strong infusion of human form, character, and expression, by which his Lions,
for example, are distinguished, as necessary, or conducive, to his allegorical purposes; or, it is pos-
sible that his knowledge of this animal may not have been thoroughly well-grounded, and that he
may have laboured under early prejudice of mind, or of vision, in this part of his education as a
Painter, and may not have seen Lions as they really are. This is what the writer is most inclined
to believe, (though not to insist); for even in treating the subject of Daniel in the den of Lions-
