On the stools illustrated several other mas have been used,

rope, and even willow may be utilized with success. Paper fiber
was discussed in detail in Chapter V and needs no elaboration.
Fig. 60 shows a stool partly woven with this serviceable material.
Sufficient to say that this fiber adapts itself admirably to almost

is, commercially, supplanting reed.
Inner hickory bark may be obtained of manufacturers of rustic
