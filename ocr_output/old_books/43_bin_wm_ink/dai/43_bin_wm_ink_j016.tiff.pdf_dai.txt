FIG. 5. METHOD OF TYING
ENDS OF CANE.
This operation is repeated until all holes have been
utilized on the two parallel rails, except those on the corners.
Thruout the seven operations it is necessary that the cane be ke'
from twisting by drawing the remaining part of the strand th
thumb and forefinger.
Step 2. The second step is identical with the first, with the dif-
ference that the other two parallel rails are used, and that the
canes run over the first set of parallel
canes. If the first strand of cane ha
not been entirely used up in the firs
step, the remainder is used to begi
the second step.
Step 3. T
epetition of the first two. The canes o

first. As ea
sed up bind the end by pulling it under
a cane, crossing e hole to another underneath the frame
and cutting off ab fin. from the cane. Fig. 5 shows how this
binding is done. The nd at the starting point is tied in thi
way, and all subseque es should be tied as they come, thu.
avoiding interference by ny pegs, and insuring neat binding.
Step 4. The actual ving begins with this step. It may
b
done entirely by hand, w out resort to the needle, but it is slov
work. The needle should used. Start at a hole next to a corner
on either rail that has been sed but once, working from caned side
toward the open frame. Gover and under the strands necessary
to form the weave, turning the needle from side to side in order to
catch the canes behind the point. When across thread the needle
with the strand and pull thru, being careful to avoid a twist. Pull
the end down thru the hole, pairing the canes. Pull the cane up
thru the next hole; then start the needle from the opposite side of
the frame and repeat the first operation, thus pairing another set
of canes. Continue until all canes are paired and all holes used.
Soak the woven cane with a wet sponge, and with two pegs
straighten the strands of cane and force all pairs together. Small,
