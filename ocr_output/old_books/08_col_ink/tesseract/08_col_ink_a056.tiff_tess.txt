and mangled shuttle-cock of powerful bats.
Much has been written and much has been said by great authorities,

efforts could aspire to reach) against the selfishness and callousness, the
inhumanity and cynicism of those great powers which have coldly looked on
and permitted the hellish atrocities and horrors of the Armenian Massacres.
The name of William Ewart Gladstone is loved and revered by Armenians
all over the world; but the thunderings of that veteran statesman and the

humanity have made themselves heard in sounding language, have Dllggon
stony ground ; they have been like the voices of men cryjg rilder-
ness. Europe has turned a deaf ear to the conde ice and
truth, even as she has turned a deaf ear to the yg veeping for
her slaughtered children.
