was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples whieh with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engage in
eommerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase the value of
the Ottoman Empire. Beeause a few among them justly started an agitation, these our noble
and industrious brethren whre being massacred. What a terrible scene! When we
left the school building we saw\ hundreds of the bodies of our Armenian compatriots heing
removed in manure carts ; legs pnd arms were hanging down outside. This bloody scene will
ever remain impressed on my nfind. |
“This shocking erime of Ybldiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a cursed absolutism, up to the last moment, srew wider. Fven during the
past nine months of the Constitifjion, in spite of the brotherly feelings which had been shown,
the awful events in Adana took Face and the souls of all true Osmanlis melted into tears,
Up to the present time the\yy rrow caused by this event has not disappeared, because this
bloody wound in our social nnot easily be cured. While we fill our stomachs with
choice morsels, while we resf \\ Wn our comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans, widows hungry, nal i Wioot wander hither and thither, and thousands of
families are fleeing from the ec convinced that the government is doing its
work, but what has happened that it can keep a government busy for
years. However much sacrif} fl it will be inadequate, because the
happiness of the fatherland dep} ood wounds as these as soon as possible.
We are convineed that the gover ed with it are persuaded of this as well as
ourselves. We must now wipe o misfortune brought by a eursed period.
We must now comfort weeping h Pinderstand aud teach those who do not
understand that patriotism and br liffer from cach other. The responsibility
of the government for the Arment: N Sand very weighty. The whole Ottoman
nation is under obligations to proted \ W racc, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
is in large part due to the blood } i Armenians. We thought that these truths
were so obvious that we preferred to \ Me, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary from time to time to reeall \\ ess of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yesterd IVarea only barbarism, and for twelve years
has been constantly oppressed and grou \ he earth, and has given thousands of victims.
Hereafter we must work to assure them! \ 1e era of massacres has passed, and with all our
strength of mind and soul we must quiet N\ The obligation of the government to protect
them is also very heavy, because our A@™#Mian countrymen live among wandering tribes.
We must all assist the government anf§Wpoint out its obligation. It must be declared in
public and periodically that the one of theWhost important duties of the Ottoman nation is to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and property of the
Armenians as well, since these are their saered rights. Let investigations be made and let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim.”

This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare disclose
his identity ; and the account given by an authority like Mr. James Bryce
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as “les Massacres occasionnés par les aventuriers Arméniens.”
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
