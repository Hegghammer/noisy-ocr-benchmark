DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE.
Thave thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested witnesses.

“Weare having a perfectly hideous time here. Thousands have been murdered—25,000
in this province they say ; but the number is probably greater, for every Christian village
was wiped out In Adana about 5000 have peyished. After Turks and Armenians had
made peace, the Turks came in the night with hosQggnd kerosene. and set fire to what remained
of the Armenian quarter. Next day the French andQjpcnian schools were fired. Nearly every-
one in the Armenian sehool perished, anybody tryiX scape being shot down by thesaldiers.”

“he Turkish Authorities do nothing except x offending Armenians, from whon
by torture they extort the most fanciful confessionsy ne wounded are not safe from
their injustice. A man was being carried in to me ¥ en he was seized and taken
off to gaol. I dare not think what his fate may be.

‘“‘ Por fiends inearnate commend me to the Tur afe from them. ‘They
murder babies in front of their mothers ; they half mi ate the wives while
the husbands are lying there dying in pools of blood.”

“The authorities did nothing, and the soldiers wer for they were ;
better armed. One house in our quarter was burned We counted
the bodies. The soldiers set fire to the door, and as Bs, nobody
could get out, Everybody in the house was roasted gen and
ehildren and old people.”—Extraet from letter of Mrs. ylie, wits ponsul
at Adana ; published in the London “ Daily Mail.”

IN THIS HOUSE 115 WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ROASTED ALIVE.
llistory repeats iteelf. In 1895 Turkish soldiers fell upon seventy to eighty young
women and girls in a church, where they had fled for refuge, and after hidcously outraging
them, barricaded them in, setting fire to the building at the same time, and derisively shouting
to their victims as they were being roasted alive, to call upon their Christ to save them now
