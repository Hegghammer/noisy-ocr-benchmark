CANING; THE SEVEN STEPS 18
open squares are thus formed over the area being caned. Unless
‘the cane is soaked it will prove rather difficult to pair the canes.

the canes either run over or under the pairs.

Step 6. This step is identical with the preceding one. The canes
are at right angles to the first diagonals. In this step and
preceding one note that two strands run into the corner

that an error has been made by the weaver.

Step 7. Pull a cane of the same size as used in the other steps up
thru a hole, over the binder cane and down thru the same hole.
A loop is thus formed and the binder secured. Pull taut, then
