British Museum bears on it the strange and anomalous figure represented
in the annexed illustration, Opinions vary somewhat as to whether
its origin might not have been Italian, but we see no reason for adopting
this view, and consider it as of decidedly home production. It will be
seen that the shoulder, upper part of the arm, and figure are those of a
