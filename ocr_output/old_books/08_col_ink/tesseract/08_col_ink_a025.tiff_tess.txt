‘‘prétendus patriotards ” in connection with the Ottoman Bank ; I cannot do
better than quote from Mr. Bryce’s version of the story, and the massacre
that followed: ‘‘In the following June serious trouble arose at Van, where
some sort of insurrection is said to have been planned, though in the discre-
pancy of the accounts it is hard to arrive at the truth. Masses of Kurds
came down threatening to massacre the Christians, and a conflict in which
many innocent persons peNshed, was with difficulty brought to an end by
the intervention of the BritiN Consul. A little later the Armenian revolu-
tionary party, emboldened b\\the rising in Crete, where the Christians, being
well armed and outnumbering \he Muslims, held their ground successfully,

suburbs. On the afternoon of the 27th the British Chargé d’Affaires (whose
action throughout won general approval) told the Sultan he would land
British sailors, and the Ambassadors telegraphed to the Sultan. Then the
general massacre was stopped, though sporadic slaughter went on round the
city during the next few days. The Ambassadors, who did not hesitate
