VI Preface.—ILntroduction.

It is said that Barnabas Horton I. was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities.

His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It is elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. The original base was of brick, but it had all crumbled down
many years ago. The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Horton.

The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads as
follows :

“Here lieth buried the body of Mr. BARNABAS Horroy was born at
Mousely, Leicestershire, Old England, and died at Sout 13th day of
July, 1680, aged 80 years.”

In the centre of the stone we fi ollows :

“ Here lies r
THI ¢ :
M. Meecnided to the throne of G
Where with sweet Jesus now I make
Then hasten after me, my dearest
To be partaker of this blessed ]j
And you, dear children, all fg he Lord,
Hear and obey His public sf word;
And in your houses call upon His name,
For oft I have advised you to the same:
Then God will bless you with your children all,
And to this blessed place He will you call.”

Heb. xi: 4.‘ He being dead, yet speaketh.”

It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted,-was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the original |
thirteen who brought his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and memory _
should not perish from the earth.
