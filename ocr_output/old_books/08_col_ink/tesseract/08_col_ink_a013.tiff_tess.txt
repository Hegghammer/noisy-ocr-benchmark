WHY AND WHEREFORE.

In making a study of my race, I have found three marked characteristics
Intelligence—Energy—Industry. Combined with these three characteristics
is an intense Love of Nationality. We live in a complex world. In an
independent people these characteristics and this sentiment are laudable

After I had laid this r Truth to heart, I did not have to seek for the
Why and Wherefore of menian Massacres.

work of extermina st was crucified on
Calvary and the s ord—but the work of their

Europe have b sles and rivalries cultivated these evil influences,
they have wat em and made them grow, but when their culminating
point is reached, they must re-act on Christendom and the natural
consequence must follow. Those who sow the wind, must reap the whirl-

of Young Turkey, but Young Turkey is only a small minority ; the great
majority of the Turkish nation are not Young Turks.

The question therefore resolves itself into this critical point: “What will
Christendom do even now?”
