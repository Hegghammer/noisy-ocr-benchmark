It is considered g ‘uropean writers

many roseate colored word pictures of Constitutional Turkey.

The murders, deportations and imprisonments of the Turkish revolu-
tionaries, or more correctly reformers, were undoubtedly the sole work of
Abdul Hamid and his palace clique, but Abdul and his minions could not

Armenians without the perpetration and participation of the Turkish

Palace, the Palace clique stirred up religious fanaticism and race hatred, but
the co-operation of the people was necessary ; and the people co-operated

Armenians always knew how to acquire by their own industry and toil; the
appeal to their marauding and bestia] instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
