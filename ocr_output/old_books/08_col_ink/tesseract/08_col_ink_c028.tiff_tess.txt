arms from around my neck, and my brothers
kissed me farewell. Then the man from the
strange boat opened the door of our wattled house

where there was a harbor with ships. There we
found a ship ready to sail for Urth.

sailors what was the Magnetberg, and he told me

iron out of ships that came near it and left them
loosened timbers upon the water.
