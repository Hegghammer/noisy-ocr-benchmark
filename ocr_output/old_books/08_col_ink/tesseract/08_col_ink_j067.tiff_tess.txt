CHAPTER VII
SgaTs oF REEDS AND SPLINTS

The discussion of the weaving processes to follow is confined.
in the main, to stools or seats. Fig. 53 shows several stools different
in design both in wood construction and in weaving. In two in-
stances it will be noted that weaving is done over_a separate frame,
one being inserted between the rails, the other fastened on top,
leaving a liktle projection. Reference is made to several possible
weaving desitns and the use of various mediums and combinations.
The possible\combinations of materials are merely suggestive of
possible other Qnes, and the individual worker will find that many
designs of var¥ing complexity may be worked out. An excellent
method for worfiing out possible designs is that of using black and
white paper strif™¥4 in. in width. The design will show up very
clearly because he contrast of the black and white. Experi-
menting with the™Keave on the seat itself is rather tedious and
unsatisfactory. T) aper strips are an excellent means to an end.

The stool top il ated in Fig. 54 employs a simple over-and-
under weave, utiliz at reed. The worker needs to decide at
the outset on the c er of weave to be used unless it be of
unusual design. In tance the weaver runs over three and
under three strands, wrapping done in a series of three.
