THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE. 49 |
having only her kirtle upon her back. John Gower, however, who
wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus describes a company of
ladies. ‘They were, says he, “clothed all alike, in kirtles with rich capes
or mantles, parti-coloured, white, and blue, embroidered all over with
various devices.” Their bodies are described as being long and small,
and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though each of them
had been a queen. We find that the tight-laced young ladies of the |
court of the Lady Triamore “had mantles of green-coloured velvet, | .
handsomely bordered _vgmlgugetd, and lined with rich furs, Their heads
were neatly att Selle) were ornamented with cut work and
richly-striped w heir kerchiefs they had. each of
them a pretty cd . sixty gems or more ;” and of
their pretty mistres rr we that her cheeks were as
. as " rose ae My y ype Ben her head
ike golden wire, falli yp richly ornamented with
. precious stones. Her v y er mantle, lined with white
ermine, was also elegant Ysame. The Princess Blanche,
the daughter of Edward Rect of the annexed illustration,
appears to have copied c ress above described, and, like the
maids of honour of the ] amore herself, she is not only richly
habited but thoroughly we as well, Thus we see, in the year
1361, the full influence of brset on the costume of that period.  .
There is another poem, sai be more ancient than even Launfal,
which, no doubt, ‘served to git tone and direction to the fashicrs of
times following after. Here WAfind a beautiful lady described as
wearing a splendid girdle of beat®\ gold, embellished with rubies and
emeralds, about her middle small.
Gower, too, when describing a lov& who is in the act of admiring
his mistress, thus writes:— — -
“He seeth hir shape forthwith, all
Hir bodye round, hir middle small.”
