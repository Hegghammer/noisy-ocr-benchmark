viii PREFACE
Srom Smith, who himself was prone to include
* the most extravagant myths in his pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HiIsToRY OF
THE Lives aNnD Actions oF THE Most Famous
HiegHwayMEN. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the “truth” of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better. 5

No one ever reprinted those authors im
their origin atravagance, or their grossness.
It would be sible ; and, if possible, it would
not be enterta Nor has any one ever edited
them, or eve an independent history of
the highwaym we consider how astonish-
ingly popular vances have ever been
which have h u Vall, and Turpin,
and their lik his is not a little
surprising.

Perhaps th i". abandoned because
of the difficult t insuperable difficulty
—of sifting fe ction, and because of a
chilling sense would be a thankless task
to present the ayman as he really was: a
fellow rarely vic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and n cowardly. No novelist would
be likely rank the frank historian for this dis-
service ; Wud I do not think the historian who came
to the subject im this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
