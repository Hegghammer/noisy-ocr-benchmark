Vian, and the lowest estimate counted the murdered dead at 109,009. Gladstone made2 the
last great speech of his heroic life. England attempted some kind of protest. But rather
than join the Liberal demand for action, Lord Rosebery left his party for .private leisure, and
Russia, France, and Germany combined to secure immunity for the “ great assassin.” It
wus the lowest point of ISurope’s shame.

Blow follo blow. Hardly had the remnant of the Armenian people escaped from
massacre when t Shnureh fell under the bratal domination of Russia, Plehve ordained its
destruction, and in was sent to Tiflis as governor-general to carry it out. Church
property to the valu 4.000,000 was seized by violence, the atholikos resolutely refusing
to give up the keys o Bb where the title deeds were kept (June, 1905). For two years
the Russian officials ] h the revenues, retaining eighty per cent. for their own
advantage. But in the 1 ssassination had rid the earth of Plehve, and the over-
whelining defeats of Russia ya were attributed to the Armenian curse. Grudgingly
the Church property was res chaos, and for the moment it is Russia’s pagicy to
favor the Armenians as a bal! Georgians, whom the St. Petersbyg iment
1s now determined to destroy.

Some of the bishops and monks, who form a counei , still look for
Europe’s interference, and trust that the solemn pledges taken d other Powers
at Berlin may be fulfilled. The Bishop of Erivan, for instanee, $ Hor the appoint-

to coneede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian Willages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Caucasus wins federal
autonomy, But the majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and industries. One cannot yet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolutionary parties of ‘The Bell” and “The Flag.” Of these,
the Social Democratic “ Bell ” follows the usual impracticable and pedantic creed of St. Marx.
The “Flag,” or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a great
assembly held in Erivan last August (1906) they adopted a programme of land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected laymen. Jf the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.

Whatever may be the political future of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, | think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could he
