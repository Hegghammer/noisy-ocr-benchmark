Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have clung to their christian faith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure.

The cathedral of Etchmiatzin built by Gregory still stands to-day ; it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, until perhaps
little of the original building may be left, butgtstill claims to be the church
built by the patron saint of Armenia. I sha m
“ Historical Sketch of the Armenian Church, lan
priest :

‘Owing to political circumstances the Armeniat d at
times to be transferred to metropolises and to o ms of
Armenia. In the year A.D. 452 it was remove o Ani,
in r1r4 to Rémklah, and in 1294 to Sis. The K coming
extinct, and, we having no more a kingdom and town, it
was natural and proper to re-transfer the See to place, as
the entire nation unanimously desired it. Accordn r144f, it

* was decided by an ecclesiastical meeting that the seat icus should
return to Holy Etchmiatzin, where to this day h served the
proper unbroken succession from our Apostles and holy Father,
St. Gregory the Illuminator.”

I read the other day in one of the foreign papers ished in Japan,
the following piece of news : ;

“ An Armenian Church pronounced by experts to dM from the second
century of the Christian era, has been discovered in a fai state of preserva-
tion in the neighbourhood of Bash-Aparnah.”

Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light on Armenian history.
