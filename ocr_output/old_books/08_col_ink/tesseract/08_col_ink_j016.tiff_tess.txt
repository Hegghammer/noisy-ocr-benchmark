utilized on the two parallel rails, except those on the corners.
Thruout the seven operations it is necessary that the cane be ker

Step 2. The second step is identical with the first, with the dif-
ference that the other two parallel rails are used, and that the

canes run over the first set of parallel

the second step.

Step 3. This step is a repetition of the first two. The @ges o
this series run over the first and second series and parallel the
first. As each strand is used up bind the end by pulling i 7
a cane, crossing from one hole to another underneath the
and cutting off about 14 in. from the cane, Fig. 5 shows ho
binding is done. ‘The loose end at the starting point is tied i
way, and all subsequent ones should be tied as they come,
avoiding interference by many pegs, and insuring neat binding’

Step 4. The actual weaving begins with this step. It m
done entirely by hand, without resort to the needle, but it is
work. The needle should be used. Start at a hole next to a co
on either rail that has been used but omce, working from caned
toward the open frame. Go over and under the strands neces
to form the weave, turning the needle from side to side in order
catch the canes behind the point. When across thread the nee
with the strand and pull thru, being careful to avoid a twist. P
the end down thru the hole, pairing the canes. Pull the cane up
thru the next hole; then start the needle from the opposite side of
the frame and repeat the first operation, thus pairing another set
of canes. Continue until all canes are paired and all holes used.
Soak the woven cane with a wet sponge, and with two pegs
straighten the strands of cane and force all pairs together. Small,
