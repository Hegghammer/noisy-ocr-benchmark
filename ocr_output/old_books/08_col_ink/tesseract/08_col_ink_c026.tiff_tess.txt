THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
I went in and stood on the floor of our house my
heart was thumping within me at the thought of
what was before.

And there was the pot boiling over the fire with
a few green herbs in it. There was Saba, my
mother, stirring the last handful of meal amongs
the green herbs. And there were my brothegf,
all older than I, sitting by the fire, waiting #r
the herbs and the meal to be ready.

When my mother looked toward us she he
man from the strange boat. She thou hat
some crime had been committed by me or ther
to bring a man of such high degree t us.
She and my brothers were greatly af th
were poor, and those who were hj
to them. But the stranger spok
“Good fortune has come to
to-day.” And when they all im
he said, “I who am very kn ul take
your son with me as an and I shall
instruct him in arts and mysteries.”

My mother said, “Th young, sir, and we
thought he would be s for a time longer.”
