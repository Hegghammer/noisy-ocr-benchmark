10 THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE,

| belles of the tribe were not slow in discovering that, when arrayed
in all the panoply of forest finery, a belt well drawn in, as shown in the
annexed illustration, served to display the figure to much greater advan-
tage than one carelessly or loosely adjusted. Here, then, we find the
first indication of the use of the corset as an article of becoming attire. |
At the very first dawn of civili there are distinct evidences of the
use of contrivances for the re |. formation of the female figure.
Researches among the ruins of pf the mysterious forest cities |
of Sonth America, whose hy yj ntiquity, have brought
to light most singular e yp Yy a now forgotten
race. Amongst fhe wg W7pas-relief repre-

At the period of tha ome of the islands of the

Eastern Archipelago, it wa. Stomary for all young females to
wear a peculiar kind of cd ormed of spirally-arranged rattan
cane, and this, when once put O&M, was not removed until the celebration
of the marriage ceremony. Such races as were slowly advancing in the

|} march of civilisation, after discovery by the early navigators, became
more and more accustomed to the use of clothing, to adjust and retain
which, waistbands would become essentially requisite. These, when
made sufficiently broad to fit without undue friction, and stiff enough to
prevent folding together in the act of stooping, sitting, or moving
about, at once became in effect corsets, and suggested to the minds
of the ingenious a system of cutting and fitting so as more perfectly to
adapt them to the figure of the wearer. The modes of fastening, as
we shall see, have been various, from the simple sewing together with
the Jace to the costly buckle and jewelled loop and stud.
