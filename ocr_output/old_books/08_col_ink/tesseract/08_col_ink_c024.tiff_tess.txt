THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
came on without sails or oars. It was a shining
boat, a boat of brass. I called to my father and
my father straightened himself up and watched it.
In the boat that came toward us of its own accord
there was 4 man standing.

The boat came into the full water between the
rocks, and then it sank down, this boat of brass, un-
til its rim touched the water. It }emained still as
if anchored. The man who was inghe prow of the
boat stepped out on the sand be n my father
and me.

He looked a man of high degre e a prince
or a potentate. He had a dark f a dark,
curly beard, and he had eyes that h j
eyes. He had on a straight Â¢c e
material covered all over with .
and in his hand he held a lon ne ff
that had the shape of two serpe isting T-
gether. He looked at me and I w htened of
him, and J turned to my father. my father
was standing there, holding the ng pole in
his hands, his mouth open, gasping fe one of the
fishes upon the rocks.
