Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this super-added evil, is, the
large nefMouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, greater marauders and
depreda n the Turks, the regular occupation of whose lives comprises
murder ¢ 7, and who have through weary centuries unremittingly
quartere on the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits nd toil. Indeed as the Hamidieh cavalry which
was estab r the Hamidian massacres was composed of
these Kur er of speculation what outlet these warriors,
trained an nurder, can now find for those habits in
which the rained to indulge by the Hamidian
régime.

Under er days can be forthcoming,
no prospect hat unhappy portion of the
Armenian keeps on the soil of the
fatherland.

The api over the provinces in-
habited by th s, or the other alternative,
of allowing espective of creed or
nationality, \ fence against the raids
and barbaritie ors; but even if suclP concessions were granted,
life for the chr subject to Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his enemies, n one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depre offences of the worst nature. Notthe most fertile
soil, not the n rable climatic conditions, not the most assiduous
industry, not th peace loving, law abiding instincts, can bring to the
Armenian peas der Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
happiness, and sity of life and property, which the law of all civilized
countries guaran@s to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil.
