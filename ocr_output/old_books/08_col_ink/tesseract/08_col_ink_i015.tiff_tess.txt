Remember that they know not what they do
Who strike in deadly fear and ghastly hate;
Remember that somehow, and at some time,
Each crime exacts its human penalty.
Remember that man’s conscience and man’s mind
Are agents of Thy purpose and Thy plan,
Which work within a deadlier revenge
Than any shrapnel shot or sabre thrust.
Remember that new generation
Upon whom fall the burde
The anguish of old h
The crushing debt, t
Restrain, O God, the sweep of thr
Recall the nations to their sense of sha:
To those in blinding war, to us at peace,
Reveal anew the message of the Christ.
