of blackened ruins, the stark walls of the churehes and houses rising up out of the ashes and
charred timbers heaped on every side. Whiut must it mean to the five thousand men and
wonien and little children who have survived a painful flight to the seacoast and have uow
returned to their mountain home, only to find their houses sacked and burned! ‘There were
nine Christian villages whieh elustered about Kessab in the valleys below. Several of these
have been completely destroyed by tire. All have been plundered and the helpless people
driven out or slain.”

“Can you imagine the feelings of the Kessab people as they climbed on foot the long trail
up the mountain, and then as they eame over the ridge into full view of thgg charred and
ruined dwellings? Their stores of wheat, barley and rice had been bur othing, cooking
utensilz, furniture and tools had _— . = : stolen ; their silk
industries stamped out ; their belo aps. The bodies of
their friends and relatives who hi r iind yet the love of
home is so strong that the people hay etermination to clear up
the debris and rebuild their houses.” — Kessab,” Stephen Van h.
Trowbridge.

As these sheets are going throug comes news of famine
at Zeitoon. The Rev. F. W. Macul lissionary at Marash,
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet, Americ t Constantinople, that
12,000 souls in and around Zeitoon are d ; they are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran and water, and eating it, if they can
get even that. Rev. Macullum adds, ‘The s omes to us from all
sides. As we foresaw all along, from now on s will be greatest.”

If 50,000 were massacred, the list of those v died and are dying
of homelessness and starvation will exceed 150, is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerated. Last year the peop] dno harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.

The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous ArmenW@gvillage that had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plunder@Mn a night attack
by armed Kurds, and the villagers are now reduced to extreme@stress. Before
the outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repe&tedly appealed
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec-
tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It is
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
