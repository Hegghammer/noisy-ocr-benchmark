like a round bow, a great brown eye revealed the inward spirit’s intelligence and zeal un-
quenched. On his head was a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.

Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century’s greatest men—Merditch
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people—slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Mtchmiatzin, or “ The Ouly-Begotten
is Descended.” From the window of a neighboring room he might have looked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now all cut close and buried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark inass of whirling snow and hurricane that hid the
cone of Ararat. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of that lake, eighty-seven years ago, Khrimian was born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land; the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom—a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Nggammast. Jong and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos now not unhappy, for
from first to last it had been inspired by onc abe iIn—the freedom and
regeneration of his people. It is true }

From his earliest years, when he ha urkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round cArarat, he wé it of nationality—such a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, bu weoing tolerance among the
prosperous and contented of the world. He audering far and wide through
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of « w Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems tl] vlories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wife’s ed himself to the building of schools,
which he generously threw open to Kurds, 'y assassins of Armenians. For many
years, while Europe was occupied with Cri Austrian wars, or French and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeyin un to Constantinople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding In the contest, ntinually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenian pa f Constantinople (1869), he was driven from
his office after four years.

But the cup of Turkish iniqug Ms filling. The pitiless slaughter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more thane ie European Powerx could stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to plead higffieople’s cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but ArmgMian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Europe
heforchand, urging them to create an autonomous neutral state for Armenia, as they had
done with success for the Lebanon. In London he hecame acquainted with Gladstone ; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and,
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey’s definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London amid shouts of “ Peace with Honor,”
and Armenia was left to stew.

So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake:
