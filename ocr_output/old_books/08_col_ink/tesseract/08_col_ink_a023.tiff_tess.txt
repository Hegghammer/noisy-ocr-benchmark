orgy, except to call them fiends incarnate; and who is the bold man who
can guarantee that these same fiends incarnate have become metamorphosed
and changed all of a sudden; or that the handful of liberal Turks at Con-
stantinople are capable of controffing and restraining them. We have not
even heard that the leaders ang@Jparticipators of the last massacres have
been punished as they deservegff and what is the reason they are left un-
punished ? because the Gov, entfis afraid to punish Mahommedans for

In conclusion, I will ask my readers to compare one point of difference
between the two races, the oppressor and the oppressed. Thousands upon
thousands of Armenian women, thousands upon thousands of Armenian
children, have been hounded to death, or savagely, ferociously, horribly and
loathsomely maltreated by the Turk, and yet in all the agonizing years when
Massacre has succeeded upon Massacre, has there been one known case or
one single instance of a Turkish weman or child maltreated by Armenians ?

The last massacres though especially organized from the Palace at
Constantinople, were officially announced to originate from an affray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed one of the three :
given equal numbers and arms, the Armenian is always a match for the
Turk, but alas for him that unequal numbers and want of arms have always
made him the victim of his oppressor.

Ahmed Riza Bey in the first part (Ses Causes) of his book ‘‘ La Crise de
