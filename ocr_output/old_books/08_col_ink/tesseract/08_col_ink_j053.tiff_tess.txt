caution used to avoid breaking strands.

Rectangular Seats.—As stated, in weaving a square seat the
initial process is repeated at all corners until all openings are filled.
In rectangular seats the spaces on the short rails will fill before

The method is this: Go over an ng rail, across half the

It should be noted that the strands in crossing at the center
be compressed one-half of their diameters. They will need to b
