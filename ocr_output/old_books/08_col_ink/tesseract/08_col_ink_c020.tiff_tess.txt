THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
story-teller’s place and fresh candles were lighted
and set upon the table.

“Your danger is great,” said the King, “and it
will be hard for you to show us that you were
ever in such danger before. Begin your story.
And if it is not a story of a narrow and a close
escape there will be little time left for you to pre-
pare for your death by the sword.”

Thereupon the youth in the foreign dress looked
long into the wine cup that was handed }fim, an
he drank a draught of the wine, and salut
the King and the lords who sat by th g,
he said:

“Once I was in greater danger, mouth
was close to me, and no hope wha as given
me of my saving my life. I wi the story,
and you shall judge whether 1 ger then was
greater than is my danger ng,

And thereupon the youtl the foreign dress,
who had tried to steal thef#Mfite horse that King
Manus owned, began the4M#Mory which is set down
here in the very words iMwhich he told it.
