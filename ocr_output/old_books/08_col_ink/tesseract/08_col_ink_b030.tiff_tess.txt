8 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

author Jas before mentioned. If, however, we should grant that they may not be capable of

afiegfonate expression toward their keeper, we can scarcely doubt that—toward their young —if

wf could observe them in their wild state, and in their moments of playful intercourse and

njoyment among each other—they are: at least, we think there are motions in their features that

indicate affection, as well as fear, enquiry, surprise, gratitude, pleasurable wantonness, and some

other sentiments, or emotions. This is our conviction: at the same time, we perceive that the

range of their ferocious expression far exceeds the savage circle of their domestic charities. Are

not even the least of these observable in the habits and manners of the domestic Cat, who belongs

to the Tiger genera? But we have even seen a Tiger in his den, who looked good-natured enough

to be stroked and patted: and of the Lion, of whom Mr. Grirriv relates the following anecdote,
what can be said or thought ? i

“ Hearing some noise under his cage, the Lion passed his paw between the bars, and actually
hauled up his keeper who was cleaning beneath ; but as soon as he perceived that he had thus ill
used his master, he instantly lay down upon his back in an attitude of complete submission.”

Or what can be said of the circumstance mentioned by SENECA (of which he was personally
witness), of a Lion, to whom a man, who had formerly been his keeper, was exposed for destruction
in the amphitheatre at Rome; and who was not only instantly recognised, but defended and
protected by the grateful beast ?—Or of the story related by Dr. Souruey, of the Lion who had .
broken loose, submitting to the Cid, and allowing himself to be led back peaceably to his place of
confinement ?
