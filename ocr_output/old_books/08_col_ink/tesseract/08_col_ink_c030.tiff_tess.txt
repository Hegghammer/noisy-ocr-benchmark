and again my master took the steering gear into
his own hands and steered the ship by a star that
he alone knew of. And when the morning came
there were no masts and spars of ships, and no
loosened timbers afloat on the waters. The
captain laughed and made

loadstone that drew the iron out of

to sail it where he would.

pack had been carried off the ship, he said to me:

you. Go on the land. Stay by a pool that is
close to the forest. Birds will come down to that
