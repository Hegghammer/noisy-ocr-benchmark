“Oh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that
I might weep day and night for the slain of my people.”

translated into English, reads, “Human Bullets.” This little book, a
narrative of the siege of Port Arthur, after being yéad through the length
and breadth of the empire, found translators translate it into the best
known of languages ; and its young author, Y@fself an actor in the siege,

In simple narra ufhor carries the reader through appatling
scenes of horror, a we read we are made to realize the slaughter of
the enemy’s machig#euns, of their ground-mines, electric-wire entangle-
ments, and explodifg shells ; we are made to hear the roar of the artillery
fire dealing death and destruction, and there rises before us the mental vision
of the fierce hand to hand conflict, and the dead and dying lying thickly in
the dark ravine.

“ For hill and battle plain,
With dying men and slain,
Grew mountain heights of pain,
And mine is boundless woe.”

The grim warrior who stormed and took the most impregnable fortress
in the world gives expression to his feelings on his own great achievement,
in saddest words.

“And mine is boundless woe,”

For the grim warrior’s heart is cleft in twain for the human bullets that

under his command hurled themselves to their death.
