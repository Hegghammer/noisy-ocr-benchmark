Further in answer to Almed Riza Bey's account of the Armenian
"prétendus patriotards" in connection with the Ottoman Bank ; I cannot do
better than quote from Mr. Bryce's version of the story, and the massacre
that followed : " In the following June serious trouble arose at Van, where
some sort of insurrection is said to have been planned, though in the discre-
pancy of the accounts it is hard to arrive at the truth. Masses of Kurds
came down threatening to massacre the Christians, and a conflict in which
many innocent persons perished, was with difficulty brought to an end by
the intervention of the British Consul. A little later the Armenian revolu-
tionary party, emboldened by the rising in Crete, where the Christians, being
well armed and outnumbering he Muslims, held their ground successfully,
issued appeals to the Embassies and to the Turkish Government to introduce
reforms, threatening disturbances if the policy of repression and massacre
was persisted in. These threats I re repeated in August, and ultimately,
on August 26, a band of about twent Armeniand belonging the revolutionary
party, made a sudden attack on the imperia Ottoman Bank in Constan-
tinopie, declaring they were prepared

Sultan refuse their demand. They ca

of whom had recently been broug,

Turkish class. Using the occasio,

and children were butchered in the streets and hunted down all through the
suburbs. On the afternoon of the 27th the British Chargé d'Affaires (whose
action throughout won general approval) told the Sultan he would land
British sailors, and the Ambassadors telegraphed to the Sultan. Then the
general massacre was stopped, though sporadic slaughter went on round the
city during the next few days. The Ambassadors, who did not hesitate
to declare that the massacre had been organised by the Government,
estimated the number of killed at from 6000 to 7000 ; the official report
