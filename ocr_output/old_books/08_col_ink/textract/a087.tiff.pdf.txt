Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have clung to their christian faith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure.
The cathedral of Etchmiatzin built by Gregory still stands to-day; it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, until perhaps
little of the original building may be left, but it still claims to be the church
built by the patron saint of Armenia. I shah
m
"Historical Sketch of the Armenian Church,
lian
priest :
"Owing to political circumstances the Armeniar
ad at
times to be transferred to metropolises and to of
vns of
Armenia. In the year A.D. 452 it was removed
to Ani,
in III4 to Rômklah, and in I294 to Sis. The Ki
ecoming
extinct, and, we having no more a kingdom and n
1
town, it
was natural and proper to re-transfer the See to
place, as
the entire nation unanimously desired it. Accordir
ar 1441, it
was decided by an ecclesiastical meeting that the seat)
licus should
return to Holy Etchmiatzin, where to this day h.
eserved the
proper unbroken succession from our Apostles and
holy Father,
St. Gregory the Illuminator."
I read the other day in one of the foreign papers
lished in Japan,
the following piece of news :
"An Armenian Church pronounced by experts to da C from the second
century of the Christian era, has been discovered in a fair state of preserva-
tion in the neiglbourhood of Bash-Aparnah."
Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light on Armenian history.
