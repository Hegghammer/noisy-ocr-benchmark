FIG.
59. WOVEN DESIGN IN FLAT REED.
These four strands comprise the unit, and it is repeated until the
frame is entirely woven. Complete half of the frame first, then
weave the other half, which is just the reverse of the first half.
In starting the weave for the second half
and I is omitted, for
it is the center of the frame. After t)
has worked out
the unit according to the method de
1 find it good
practice to write it out graphically
reaving th
seat. The unit above applies to t
hold good on seats utilizing mo
easily made in weaving this pat
watching at two places. TY
