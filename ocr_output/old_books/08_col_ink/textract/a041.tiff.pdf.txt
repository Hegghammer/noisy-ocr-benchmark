like a round bow, : great brown eye revealed the inward spirit's intelligence and zeal (111-
quenched. On his head was a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.
Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest men-Morditeh
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people-slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or The Ouly-Begotten
is Descended. From the window of a neighboring l'oom he might have looked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now all eut close and buried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling suow and hurricane that hid the
cone of Ararat. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of that lake, eighty-sevel years ago, Khrimian was born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land; the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able Powrers of Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom-a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Cast. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos now loo!
L not unhappy, for
from first to last it had been inspired by one
mithe freedom and
regeneration of his people. It is true ]
From his carliest years, when lie hat
urkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round Ararat, he wa
rit of nationality-such a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, bu
ygoing tolerance among the
prosperous and contented of the world. He
andering far and wide through
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of
gr Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems th
glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wife's
oted himself to the building of schools,
which he generously threw open to Kurds,
ry assassins of Armenians. For many
years, while Europe was occupied with Cril
Austrian wars, Or French and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying
an to Constantinople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest,
ontinually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred e
of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenian pat
of Constantinople (1869), he was driven from
his office after four years.
But the cup of Turkish iniqui
us filling. The pitiless slaughter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than et the European Powers could stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight t way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to plead his people's cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armedian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Europe
beforchand, urging them to create :111 autonomous nentral state for Armenia, as they had
done with success for the Lebanon. In London he became acquainted with Gladstone ; but
Gladstono was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and,
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey's definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London amid shouts of " Peace with Honor,'
and Armenia was left to stew.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake-
