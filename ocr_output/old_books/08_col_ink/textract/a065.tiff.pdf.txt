religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this super-added evil, is, the
large ne ouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, greater marauders and
depredat

murder a

quartered
upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits
and toil. Indeed as the Hamidieh cavalry which
was estab
