THE ZONE
Avert Thy gaze, O God, close tight Thine eyes!
Glance down no longer on the ocean foam,
Lest Thou behold such horrors as can turn
Men's burning hearts to ice, and chill their souls.
Keep Thine heart warm and full of charity
That Thou mayst yet be able to forgive,
And pity feel for those who know not when
To pause in deeds of ruthless saurifice.
Restrain Thy wrath, and keep
hand in
check;
Smite not, nor fiercely thrust witl
Those who can dare to strew the
With fellow creatures, innocent of
Forget the studied purpose to desti
The launching of the missile throug
eep;
Theshattered hull; the crushed and b
: forms;
The seething swirl of wreckage, won
len.
