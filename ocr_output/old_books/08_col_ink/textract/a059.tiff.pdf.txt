PART II.
OUT OF THE DEPTHS.
"Oh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that
I might weep day and night for the slain of my people."
A book has been written and published in Japan, its title "Niku Dan"
translated into English, reads, 'Human Bullets." This little book, a
narrative of the siege of Port Arthur, after being read through the length
and breadth of the empire, found translators yo translate it into the best
known of languages ; and its young author, an actor in the siege,
was summoned to the presence of his sover gn to be thanked and praised.
The book is a graphic narrative of the mos terrible siege in history, wherein
is vividly portrayed the deadly strugg the besiegers. It contains as an
acknowledgement of it
re
on which is recorded the Field
Marshal's appreciation
ge bearing the Commanding General's
commendation.
In simple narra;
author carries the reader through appalling
scenes of horror, ay
we read we are made to realize the slaughter of
the enemy's machiu guns, of their ground-mines, electric-wire entangle-
ments, and exploding shells ; we are made to hear the roar of the artillery
fire dealing death and destruction, and there rises before us the mental vision
of the fierce hand to hand conflict, and the dead and dying lying thickly in
the dark ravine.
'For hill and battle plain,
With dying men and slain,
Grew mountain heights of pain,
And mine is boundless woe."
The grim warrior who stormed and took the most impregnable fortress
in the world gives expression to his feelings on his own great achievement,
in saddest words.
"And mine is boundless woe,"
For the grim warrior's heart is cleft in twain for the human bullets that
under his command hurled themselves to their death.
