can guarantee that these same fiends incarnate have become metamorphosed

In conclusion, I will ask my readers to compare one point of difference
between the two races, the oppressor and the oppressed. Thousands upon
thousands of Armenian women, thousands upon thousands of Armenian

one single instance of a Turkish wcman or child maltreated by Armenians ?
The last massacres though especially organized from the Palace at
Constantinople, were officially announced to originate from an affray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed one of the three :

Turk, but alas for him that unequal numbers and want of arms have always
made him the victim of his oppressor.
