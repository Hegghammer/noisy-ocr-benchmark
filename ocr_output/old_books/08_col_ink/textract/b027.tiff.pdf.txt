CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

No. VI.
IN this GROUP by MR. EDWIN LANDSEER there is much of violent alimal Expression, and
Character fades before it, or rather, is absorbed in it. It tells a story of the past as well as the
present,
with a catastrophe not difficult to anticipate from the actions and
expressions
mored. A FAWN has been seized by a LEOPARD, who has been
despoiled of his
TICER. The Tiger in his turn becomes the victim of an
enraged LION.
The expression
Inful suffering mingled with dread.
Together, they amount
nits. The Tiger is still enraged and
resisting, though astounde

energy of resistance, and is b

while his expression is that of ter

yet subdued.
The Lion, who has just made IT hur
appears conscious of having fatally seized
his adversary, and luxuriates fearlessly in h
and with a powerful and just expression of
carnivorous enjoyment.-Meanwhile the cha
of the animals, severally, are faithfully and
specifically represented.
Although our main purpose be to exhibit her a pictorial than a physiological view of the
subject having descanted on the word Charactor, we shall probably be expected to add, at least
a word or two, on the leading characteristics of the carnivorous class of quadrupeds.
The generic characters of the Feline, or Cat, kind, are easily enumerated in the concise
language of the naturalists. Their heads are round; their visages short : they have six cutting
teeth, and two canine, in either jaw : their tongues are aculeated, the prickles inclining backward ;
their claws sharp, hooked, and retractile ; their ears small and acuminated they have five toes on
each of the fore-feet, and four only on those behind.
Of this grenera of Cats, we here exhibit the four principal species, Lions, Tigers, Leopards,
and Panthers, of which the Lion is justly placed at the head-at least, the unanimous voice of ages
has pronounced him to be the king of beasts, and we have enthroned him accordingly in our Title-
page, (No. I.) They form a tribe that is especially and properly Carnivorous, being the only
class of quadrupeds that are exclusively flesh-caters. Their jaws are very completely armed for
this purpose ; their canine teeth being very long and angular, with the edges of the angles turned
toward the inside of their mouths so that when the animal has caused them to meet, or cross each
other in the flesh of its prey, these formidable teeth will cut or tear a way through, by drawing
them back without opening his mouth.
Their claws, and the formation of their feet, too, are eminently conducive to their predacious
