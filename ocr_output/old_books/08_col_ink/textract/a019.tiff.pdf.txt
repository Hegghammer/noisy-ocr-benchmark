INTRODUCTION
TO 2ND PRINTING.
My object in writing this little book is to lay the hard case of my un-
fortunate race before the men and women of the United States ; it is
from the United States that the American Missionaries have gon orth, who
have been the only helping influence from without for my suff g people in
Asiatic Turkey. To the earnest and devoted men a

that
way ; t's subterranean fires are always there, but all of a sudden
the sulphur flames of religious fanaticism burst, the lava floods of race hatred
and lust of plunder, break forth and run in fiery streams the unfortunate
victims are pounced upon, swooped upon, pillaged, plundered, butchered,
slaughtered, subjected to outrages so hideous, cruel, loathsome, and revolt-
ing, that no pen could depict their horrible realities and the details can never
go into print. The human mind is staggered and asks itself the question if
even the imaginations of fiends and devils could originate such horrors.
Then this orgy of the hnman fiends is arrested. For the time being the
appetite for blood, lust, and plunder is satisfied ; for the time being, the eye
is content with the scenes of havoc and desolation lying under the sun ; the
