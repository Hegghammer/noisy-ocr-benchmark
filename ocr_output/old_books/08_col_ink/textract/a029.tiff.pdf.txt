THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN.
Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in IS7S, and the signing 0 still more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Ai

GENERA PRINCE LOHIS MELIKOFF.
Commanded the Russian forces in Asiatic Turkey
during the Russo-Turkish war and captured the im-
pregnable fortress of Kars. Appointed Prime Minister
of Russia by Alexander II. The liberal policy which
characterized the reign of that excellent monarch, and
the Constitution that he was on the eve of granting to
his people were influenced by Melikoft ; but after the
death of Alexander II he was not allowed to continue in
his good work of reforming Russia, being overthrown
from office early in the reign of Alexander III.
