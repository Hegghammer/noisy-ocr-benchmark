CHAPTER VII
SEATS OF REEDS AND SPLINTS
The discussion of the weaving processes to follow is confined,
in the main, to stools or seats. Fig. 53 shows several stools different
in design both in wood construction and in weaving. In two in-
stances it will be noted that weaving is done over a separate frame,
one being inserted between the rails, the other fastened on top,
leaving a little projection. Reference is made to several possible
weaving desions and the use of various mediums and combinations.
The possible combinations of materials are merely suggestive of
possible other nes, and the individual worker will find that many
designs of varying complexity may be worked out. An excellent
method for wor ing out possible designs is that of using black and
white

clearly because O the contrast of the black and white. Experi-
menting with the yeave on the seat itself is rather tedious and
unsatisfactory. T paper strips are an excellent means to an end.
The stool top ill tated in Fig. 54 employs a simple over-and-
under weave, utilizi

the outset on the ck
er of weave to be used unless it be of
unusual design. In
stance the weaver runs over three and
under three strands, a
wrapping done in a series of three.
