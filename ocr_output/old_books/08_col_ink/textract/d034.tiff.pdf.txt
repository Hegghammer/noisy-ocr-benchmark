maid, do not trouble your head about it now; when you
are older we can talk about it.'?
"Are the heretics such very wicked people then, do
you think, Aline!'.
Aline put her little white hand to her chin and looked
down. "I do not know what to think about it," she
said. "I suppose that they are, but they do not seem
to be treated fairly."
"I hate unfairness," said Audry in her impulsive way.
"I do not see why they should not be allowed to speak
for themselves, and I do not see how people can condemn
them when they do not know what their reasons are for
thinking what they do. Of course I am very young and
do not know an thing about it; but it sounds as though
the priests were
id that the truth can not take care
of itself; but sure
not be the truth if it is afraid
to hear the other si

t and will
prevail. If it is the truth i
win ;
can do it
no harm to have objections
sed agains
as it will
only make their error more clear."
"What about the book, Aline?" said Audry, changing
the subject; "no one is likely to come up here now, they
never do; so I think we could have another look at it."
