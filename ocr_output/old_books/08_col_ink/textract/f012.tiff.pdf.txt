PREFACE
from Smith, who himself was prone to include
the most extraragant myths in his pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE LIVES AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAMOUS
HIGHWAYMEN. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the "truth" of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.
No one / S ever reprinted those wuthors in
their origina extravagance, or their grossness.
It would be
?
sible; and, if possible, it would
not be enterta
Nor has any one ever edited
them, or even
an independent history of
the highwayme
we consider how astonish-
ingly popular
mances have ever been
which have he
Du Vall, and Turpin,
and their like
this is not " little
surprising.
Perhaps th
n abandoned because
of the difficult
st insuperable difficulty
-of sifting fo
fiction, and because of a
chilling sense
would be a thankless task
to present the
bayman as he really was. : a
fellow rarely foic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and en cowardly. No novelist would
be likely * mank the frank historian for this dis-
service, and I do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
