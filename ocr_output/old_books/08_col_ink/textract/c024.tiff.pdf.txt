boat, a boat of brass. I called to my father and
my father straightened himself up and watched it.
In the boat that came toward us of its own accord
there was á man standing.
The boat came into the full water between the
rocks, and then it sank down, this boat of brass, un-
til its rim touched the water. It remained still as
if anchored. The man who was in he prow of the
boat stepped out on the sand bet en my father
and me.

or a potentate. He had a dark f
a dark,
curly beard, and he had eyes that y
