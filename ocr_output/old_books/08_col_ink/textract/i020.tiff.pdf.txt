THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
Friday noon (May 7) we made only 462 miles.
This was partly accounted for by the fact that
we picked up Greenwich time at Cape Clear
and put the clock ahead 1 hour and 40
minutes.
The reason this small run impressed itself
upon my mind was that I expected that
when we sighted the Irish Coast the "Lucy"
would show a burst of "top speed" and that
we should go
ing up at not less than 25
miles an hour. Th
up to Thursday noon
(May 6) had been 484
and so confident
was I that she would pu
eam that I
bought the high number in
ol (for
Friday), which was 499. It was t'
I went into and I couldn't help it,
number sold at £3.0.0 and at that pric
looked like a "bargain."
During the forenoon of Thursday (May 6)
we swung out and uncovered 22 lifeboats, 11
on each side, showing Captain Turner's pre-
( 4 )
