story-teller's place and fresh candles were lighted
and set upon the table.
"Your danger is great," said the King, "and it
will be hard for you to show us that you were
ever in such danger before. Begin your story.
And if it is not a story of a narrow and a close
escape there will be little time left for you to pre-
pare for your death by the sword."
Thereupon the youth in the foreign dress looked
long into the wine cup that was handed Mim, and
he drank a draught of the wine, and l salute
the King and the lords who sat by the
ng,
he said :
"Once I was in greater danger,
mouth
was close to me, and no hope wha;
was given
me of my saving my life. I wi
the story,
and you shall judge whether mi
higer then was
greater than is my danger noi
And thereupon the youth
the foreign dress,
who had tried to steal the nite horse that King
Manus owned, began the .ory which is set down
here in the very words i which he told it.
