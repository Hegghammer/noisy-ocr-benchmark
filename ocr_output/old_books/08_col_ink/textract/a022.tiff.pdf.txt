as wretched as the Slavs or Cretans have been ; and in so far worse off,
that in Europe there exists no large body of tribes making murder and
robbery its regular and daily occupation as the Kurds, and latterly the
Circassians also, have done in Armenia. If anyone will take the trouble to
read the complaints of oppressions and cruelties presented to the Porte by
the Armenian Patriarchate in I 1872 (since reprinted in England) and some of
the more recent statements printed by the Armenians in England on the
same topic, he will see that the state of Turkish Asia presents as grave and

the reform party does not comprise the whole Turkish nation, and until the
Turk learns to become liberal, civilized and human, there may be no more
Armenians left, unless some Christian Power such as the United States
demands their protection and enforces it. No my Christian friends, it can
be well for other Christians in the Turkish Empire with their powerful
Governments at their back ; but alas ! there is no security for a subject
people alien in race and religion.
The massacres in April last raged from Adana to Alexandretta, and
according to authenticated reports about fifty thousand men, women and
children were hideously exterminated; more than this, the last massacres
