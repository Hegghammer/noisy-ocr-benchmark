spite of the feared fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history.
At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nereès, the Patriareh, their object being to request the signatory Powers of
the Berlin Treaty to force a guarantee from the Turkish G inment to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.
Abdul Hamid and his advisers were furious at this
lonseigneur Nercès was
summoned to the Palace. It is said that when he

and asked one of of his curates to read the Bur

After dinner, as usual, coffée was served. Now, this

guests to bring their

and also superintends
the making of his coffee). The Archbishop was presented y

This was enough for the Archbishop ; he pretended to be startled and spilt the coffée, but,
alas ! he had already drunk a small quantity of it. Meanwhile a seuflle was going behind
the portiere, where his poor servant Vartan was paying the penalty of his devotion to his
master. Concerning Vartan's whereabouts or his ultimate end nothing was ever made public
--the poor fellow simply vanished. Monseigneur Varjabétian, after a short interval thanked
the Pasha for his generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
