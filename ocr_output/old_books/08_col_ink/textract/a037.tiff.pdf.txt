No one doubts that a great forward movement is reaching its culminat-
ing point in the destiny of Asia. The West has learnt its all of religion (the
moral and guiding principle of mankind) from the East, and now the East
would fain learn the law of restraint and the law of freedom (the protecting
principles of mankind) from the West. Inspired by this feeling the liberal
Turks decidedly mean well, and they are animated with a sincere desire to
ensure peace and security of life and property for the heterogeneous peoples
under the Turkish sway, but they themselves have had to contend and still
have to contend with a fanatical populace.
To the Maho medan world at large the Caliph of Islam is the envoy of
God, the sacrednes
f whose person must be inviolate. Abdul Hamid, the
astute politician, kne
the security of his sovereignty depended on his
Caliphal rights, and li
policy during the long period of his execrable
reign had been direc
ds preserving and asserting the same; thus
we can see how his det
thich the liberal Turks would gladly have
accomplished simultaned
inaugure on of the Constitution, had
to be deferred to a lat
necessary for the She K ul
Islam to pronounce the
trust, a violator of the
holy law of the Pro
t
could be dared or
accomplished.

Turkey
1st of the followers
of a hostile religion, with no power or force behind which makes for
protection. Who does not know that the great numerical preponderance of
Hinduism keeps the balance of power in India, and restrains bloody religious
hostilities; and when we review the whole religious history of Christian
Europe, and that terribly long roll of crimes committed in the name of Him
who expounded His religion with the parable of the Good Samaritan, and
the precept ofloving one's neighbour as one's self, we cannot feel surprise at
the fanatical outbursts of the followers of Mahommed, the founder of a
religion whose doctrines certainly fall short of the humane principles
inculcated by the Founder of Christianity. If authentic historical facts prove
to us that horrible and atrocious cruelties have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other religionists, but on fellow Christians of different
denominations, how then can we expect better things from the Turk unless
some power or force restrain him ?
Christianity has now partly emancipated herself from the ferocities
which darkened and poured the red stream of blood on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at large, religion is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite.
