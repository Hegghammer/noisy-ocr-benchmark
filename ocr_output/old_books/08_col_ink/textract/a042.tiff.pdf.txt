last great speech of his heroie life. England attempted some kind of protest. But rather
than join the Liberal demand for action, Lord Rosebery left his party for private leisure, and
Russia, France, and Germany combined to secure immunity for the "great assassin." It
was the lowes point of Europe's shame.

massacre when th
Church fell under the brotal domination of Russia. Plehve ordained its
destruction, and

Arge party willing
to concede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian llages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armeniam province, in the happy day when the Cancasus wins federal
autonomy. But the majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and industries. One cannot vet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolutionary parties of The Bell' and "The Flag." Of these,
the Social Democratic Bell" follows the usual impracticable and pedantic creed of St. Marx.
The Flag," or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a great
assembly held in Erivan last August (1906) they adopted a programme of land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected laymen. If the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.
Whatever nay be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as il race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
