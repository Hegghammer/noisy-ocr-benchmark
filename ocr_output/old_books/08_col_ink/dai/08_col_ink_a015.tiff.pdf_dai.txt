DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE.

I have thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested witnesses.
We are having a perfectly hideous time here. Thousands have been murdered-25,000
in this province they say; but the number is probably greater, for every Christian village
was wiped out In Adana about 5000 have perished. After Turks and Armenians had
made peace, the Turks came in the night with hos and kerosene, and set fire to what remained
of the Armenian quarter. Next day the French andmenian schools were fired. Nearly every-
one in the Armenian school perished, anybody tryi scape being shot down by thesoldiers."
“The Turkish Authorities do nothing except a
offending Armenians, from whom
by torture they extort the most fanciful confessions
he wounded are not safe from
their injustice. A man was being carried in to me
hen he was seized and taken
off to gaol. I dare not think what his fate may be.
"For fiends incarnate commend me to the Turk
afe from them. They
murder babies in front of their mothers; they half mu
late the wives while
the husbands are lying there dying in pools of blood."
"The authorities did nothing, and the soldiers wer
for they were
better armed. One house in our quarter was burned
We counted
the bodies. The soldiers set fire to the door, and as
nobody
could get out. Everybody in the house was roasted
children and old people."-Extract from letter of Mrs.
Sonsul
at Adana; published in the London “Daily Mail."

IN THIS HOUSE 115 WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ROASTED ALIVE.
History repeats itself. In 1895 Turkish soldiers fell upon seventy to eighty young
women and girls in a church, where they had fled for refuge, and after hideously outraging
them, barricaded them in, setting fire to the building at the same time, and derisively shouting
to their victims as they were being roasted alive, to call upon their Christ to save them now
