Van, and the lowest estimate counted the murdered dead at 100,000. Gladstone made the
last great speech of his heroic life. England attempted some kind of protest. But rather
than join the Liberal demand for action, Lord Rosebery left his party for private leisure, and
Russia, France, and Germany combined to secure immunity for the "great assassin." It
was the lowest point of Europe's shame.
Blow follow blow. Hardly had the remnant of the Armenian people escaped from
massacre when the Church fell under the brutal domination of Russia. Plehve ordained its
destruction, and in was sent to Tiflis as governor-general to carry it out. Church
property to the valu
000,000 was seized by violence, the Katholikos resolutely refusing
to give up the keys of where the title deeds were kept (June, 1903). For two years
the Russian officials p

advantage. But in the
Assassination had rid the earth of Plehve, and the over-

to concede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian lages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Cancasus wins federal
autonomy. But the majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and industries. One cannot yet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolutionary parties of "The Bell" and "The Flag." Of these,
the Social Democratic "Bell" follows the usual impracticable and pedantic creed of St. Marx.
The "Flag," or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a great
assembly held in Erivan last August (1906) they adopted a programme of land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected laymen. If the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.
Whatever may be the political future of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
