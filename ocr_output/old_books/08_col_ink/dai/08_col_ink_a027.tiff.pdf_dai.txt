was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples which with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engage in
commerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase the value of
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few among them justly started an agitation, these our noble
and industrious brethren were being massacred. What a terrible scene! When we
left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our Armenian compatriots being
removed in manure carts; legs and arms were hanging down outside. This bloody scene will
ever remain impressed on my mind.
"This shocking crime of ildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a cursed absolut sm, up to the last moment, grew wider. Even during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feelings which had been shown,
the awful events in Adana took lace and the souls of all true Osmanlis melted into tears.
Up to the present time theep rrow caused by this event has not disappeared, because this
bloody wound in our social nnot easily be cured. While we fill our stomachs with
choice morsels, while we rest
our comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans, widows hungry, nak
foot wander hither and thither, and thousands of
families are fleeing from the i

work, but what has happened
that it can keep a government busy for
years. However much sacrif

happiness of the fatherland dep

We are convineed that the gover

ourselves. We must now wipe of
misfortune brought by a eursed period.
We must now comfort weeping h
nderstand and teach hose who do not
understand that patriotism and br
differ from each other. The responsibility
of the government for the Armenia
and very weighty. The whole Ottoman
nation is under obligations to prote
race, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
is in large part due to the blood
Armenians. We thought that these truths
were so obvious that we preferred to
whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary from time to time to recall
of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yester ndured only barbarism, and for twelve years
has been constantly oppressed and grou the earth, and has given thousands of victims.
Hereafter we must work to assure them he era of massacres has passed, and with all our
strength of mind and soul we must quiet The obligation of the government to protect
them is also very heavy, because our Aian countrymen live among wandering tribes.
We must all assist the government and point out its obligation. It must be declared in
public and periodically that the one of the most important duties of the Ottoman nation is to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and property of the
Armenians as well, since these are their sacred rights. Let investigations be made and let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim.”
This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare disclose
his identity; and the account given by an authority like Mr. James Bryce
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as "les Massacres occasionnés par les aventuriers Arméniens."
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
