and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the feared fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history,
At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nercès, the Patriarch, their object being to request the signatory Powers of
the Berlin Treaty to force a guarantee from the Turkish G nment to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.

alas! he had already drunk a small quantity of it. Meanwhile a scuflle was going on behind
