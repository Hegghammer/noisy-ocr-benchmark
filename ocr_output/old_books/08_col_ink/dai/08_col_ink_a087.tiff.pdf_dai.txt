Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have clung to their christian ſaith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure.
The cathedral of Etchmiatzin built by Gregory still stands to-day ; it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, until perhaps
little of the original building may be left, but it still claims to be the church
built by the patron saint of Armenia. I shall
"Historical Sketch of the Armenian Church,

"Owing to political circumstances the Armenian

town, it
was natural and proper to re-transfer the See to
place, as
the entire nation unanimously desired it. Accordi

was decided by an ecclesiastical meeting that the seat

return to Holy Etchmiatzin, where to this day h

proper unbroken succession from our Apostles and
holy Father,
St. Gregory the Illuminator."
I read the other day in one of the foreign papers
ished in Japan,
the following piece of news :
"An Armenian Church pronounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christian era, has been discovered in a fair state of preserva-
tion in the neighbourhood of Bash-Aparnah.”
Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light on Armenian history.
