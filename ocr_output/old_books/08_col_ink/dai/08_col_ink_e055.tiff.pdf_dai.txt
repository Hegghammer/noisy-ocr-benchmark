THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.

having only her kirtle upon her back. John Gower, however, who
wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus describes a company of
ladies. They were, says he, "clothed all alike, in kirtles with rich capes
or mantles, parti-coloured, white, and blue, embroidered all over with
various devices." Their bodies are described as being long and small,
and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though each of them
had been a queen.
We find that the tight-laced young ladies of the
court of the Lady Triamore "had mantles of green-coloured velvet,
handsomely bordered 14, and lined with rich furs. Their heads
were neatly at
ed were ornamented with cut work and
richly-striped w
their kerchiefs they had each of
them a pretty co
sixty gems or more;” and of
their pretty mistres
that her cheeks were as
red as the rose when
hone upon her head
like golden wire, fallin
richly ornamented with
precious stones. Her v
her mantle, lined with white
ermine, was also eleganti
same. The Princess Blanche,
the daughter of Edward
ject of the annexed illustration,
appears to have copied cl dress above described, and, like the
maids of honour of the I amore herself, she is not only richly
habited but thoroughly we as well. Thus we see, in the year
1361, the full influence of orset on the costume of that period.
There is another poem, said
be more ancient than even Launfal,
which, no doubt, served to give tone and direction to the fashicns of
times following after. Here w find a beautiful lady described as
wearing a splendid girdle of beate gold, embellished with rubies and
emeralds, about her middle small.
Gower, too, when describing a lover who is in the act of admiring
his mistress, thus writes:-
"He seeth hir shape forthwith, all
Hir bodye round, hir middle small.”
