PART I.
THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN.
Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing still more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate A
dion stands without
its parallel in history.
In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a pict

It was a curious irony of Fate, that
ng of "the
terrible stronghold of Kars,” universally adm
of the greatest
and most difficult military exploits ever achie
rowning success
of the Russian arms in Asiatic Turkey, shou
accomplished by
an Armenian General; that although Arm
als in the Russian
service had led to conquest, and Armenian
aght, conquered and
died, yet by these successes not only was
ration attained of the
hard fate of their unhappy nation under T ale, but that fate, hard
before, was made a hundredfold and even a ndfold harder.
GENERA FRINCE LOHIŠ MELIKOFF.
Commanded the Russian forces in Asiatic Turkey
during the Russo-Turkish war and captured the im-
pregnable fortress of Kars. Appointed Prime Minister
of Russia by Alexander II. The liberal policy which
characterized the reign of that excellent monarch, and
the Constitution that he was on the eve of granting to
his people were influenced by Melikoft; but after the
death of Alexander II he was not allowed to continue in
his good work of reforming Russia, being overthrown
from office early in the reign of Alexander III.
