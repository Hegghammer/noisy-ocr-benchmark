CARNIVOUS QUADRUPEDS.

HE PLATES.
THAT there has hitherto existed
ook of Engravings of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the progress of the student in
tment of Art, is to be regretted. The talents
of Mr. JoHN SCOTT, brought into act
of GILPIN, COOPER, and the REINAGLES,
have presented the public with excellen
ons of the distinguished ornaments of the
turf: the sports of the field, and the h
ners of the canine race, were also duly
honoured: but of the ferocious TIGER tri
ordly LION, we have nothing extant that
would bear critical inspection, beyond a
ed prints:-nothing like a collection of
figures, whose justness and accuracy of ion, character, and expression, might be
relied on.
Does any reader imagine that the var tchings which have been performed—chiefly
abroad-by Artists of no mean ability, may be idered as exceptions? They are not exceptions :
or at best, the number which might be so regated is but small, and those, for the most part, of
dimensions not accommodated to the drawer of he cabinet, or the shelf of the library.
But they are not objectionable on this ground alone. Speaking of them in the aggregate, the
heavier charge lies against them of being insufficient to those purposes of taste and information
which are the ends of Art. Even those after TITIAN and after RUBENS (the latter of whom has
perhaps painted a greater number than any other of the old masters) are far more deficient in
form, character, and expression, than is generally supposed, or than will be easily believed, by
those who have not actually compared them with the Lions, Leopards, and Tigers of Nature.
They have been taken too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
-Nor is this intended to impugn the merits, as historical or poetical painters, of those distinguished
Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that as a painter of allegory, RUBENS
might consider that strong infusion of human form, character, and expression, by which his Lions,
for example, are distinguished, as necessary, or conducive, to his allegorical purposes; or, it is pos-
sible that his knowledge of this animal may not have been thoroughly well-grounded, and that he
may have laboured under early prejudice of mind, or of vision, in this part of his education as a
Painter, and may not have seen Lions as they really are. This is what the writer is most inclined
to believe, (though not to insist); for even in treating the subject of Daniel in the den of Lions—
