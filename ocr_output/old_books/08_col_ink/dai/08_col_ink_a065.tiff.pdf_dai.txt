Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt; this super-added evil, is, the

countries guarantes to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil.
