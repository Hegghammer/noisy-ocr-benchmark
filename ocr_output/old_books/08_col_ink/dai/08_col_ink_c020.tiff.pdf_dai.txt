THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
story-teller's place and fresh candles were lighted
and set upon the table.
"Your danger is great," said the King, “and it
will be hard for you to show us that you were
ever in such danger before. Begin your story.
And if it is not a story of a narrow and a close
escape
there will be little time left for
you to
pre-
pare for your death by the sword.”
Thereupon the youth in the foreign dress looked
long into the wine cup that was handed him, and
he drank a draught of the wine, and salute
the King and the lords who sat by the ng,
he said:
"Once I was in greater danger,
mouth
was close to me, and no hope what was given
me of my saving my life. I wi the story,
and you shall judge whether m nger then was
greater than is my danger no
And thereupon the youth the foreign dress,
who had tried to steal the ite horse that King
Manus owned, began theory which is set down
here in the very words in which he told it.
