Isaac Horton was a member
sh, of Colchester;
but after he moved to Liberty,
e usually attended
the Episcopal Church
Liberty Falls, in
1827 or 1828, another in 184.–42. He was quite extensively engaged
in the manufacture of bed-posts and other turned work, including
wooden bowls; also in shipping curled and birds-eye maple. Politi-
cally he was a whig, and an ardent supporter of Clay and Webster.
He died 10 May, 1855. She is still living.
Under date of 8 February, 1874, Webb Horton writes, “My mother
is living and in good health. She resides at Liberty, Sullivan Co.,
N. Y. She is in the eighty-seventh year of her age.
Her father died
aged eighty-eight, and her grandmother, Prudence Schofield, aged
ninety-four. She has now living ten children, thirty-seven grand-
children, and nineteen great-grandchildren.”
This is a very remarkable family-so large and yet so few deaths.
