THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
I went in and stood on the floor of our house my
heart was thumping within me at the thought of
what was before.
And there was the pot boiling over the fire with
a few green herbs in it. There was Saba, my
mother, stirring the last handful of meal amongst
the green herbs. And there were my brother,
all older than I, sitting by the fire, waiting or
the herbs and the meal to be ready.
When
my
mother looked toward us she s the
man from the strange boat. She thoug that
some crime had been committed by me or ather
to bring a man of such high degree a
st us.
She and my brothers were greatly af
they
were poor, and those who were hi
to them. But the stranger spok
"Good fortune has come to y
to-day.” And when they all
him
he said, "I who am very kn
will take
your son with me as an a
and I shall
instruct him in arts and c
mysteries."
My mother said, "The young, sir, and we
thought he would be us for a time longer.”
