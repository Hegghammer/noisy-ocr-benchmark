Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
Turkish rule? To this question, we must answer an emphatic No!
The causes that must operate against any change are many and deep-
seated. In the first place it cannot be expected that a few Turks of liberal
ideas (or it may be French polished) at Constantinople, are going to change
the teght and character of the nation. The characteristics of a people
change
they ever change at all, and the predominant national
traits of the
Turk have been shown to the world to
be, cruelty and
ce sensuality; and what is
more than all, an
st, is, that they are a

To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans, and
intimate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahommedan is above all things a Mahommedan. His

"unbelievers" absolved.
