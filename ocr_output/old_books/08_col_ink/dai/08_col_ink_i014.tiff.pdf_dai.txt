Avert Thy gaze, O God, close tight Thine eyes!
Glance down no longer on the ocean foam,
Lest Thou behold such horrors as can turn
Men's burning hearts to ice, and chill their souls.
Keep Thine heart warm and full of charity
That Thou mayst yet be able to forgive,
And pity feel for those who know not when
To

in deeds of ruthless sarrifice.
Restrain Thy wrath, and keep e hand in

With fellow creatures, innocent of
Forget the studied purpose to dest
The launching of the missile throug
The shattered hull; the crushed and be
The seething swirl of wreckage, won
eep;
