once, as it was bursted by overloading on one Thanksgiving Day, and
about eight or ten inches of the muzzle cut off.
The CASK, in which he packed a portion of his household goods,
and brought over with him, is still in existence, and is owned by
Gilbert W. Horton, of Bay View, Southold. It is doubly historic
from the fact that when the British invaded Long Island it was filled
with eat and buried, thus securing the wheat from the foraging

THE HO
SETTLERS IN THIS COUNTRY.
The word
-Saxon language means an enclosure,
or garden of
is said to be derived from ort and tun,
ort, meaning
un, enclosed. The name is evidently of
Latin origin, a en known in England ever since the conquest
of Cæsar.
The Horton England, and their descendants in America, have
generally been cultivators of the soil. They have been found almost
universally in the middle class of society, and it is not known that
any royal blood has ever coursed in their veins. They are, and always
have been, producers rather than consumers, and for industry, integ-
rity, and piety, they will lose nothing in a comparison with the re-
nowned families of either the new or the old world.
The first of the family who emigrated to this country, of whom we
have any authentic record, came over from England 1633 to 1638.
Thomas, Jeremiah, and Barnabas, were among the early emigrants,
and old tradition says they were brothers. Thomas came over in the
"Mary and John," in 1633, settled permanently in Springfield, Mass.
