PREFACE
On the analogy of the famous apple, "there ain't
going to be no" preface, "not nohow." Children do
not read prefaces, so anything of a prefatory nature
that might interest them is put at the beginning of chap-
ter one.
As for the grown-ups the story is not written for gro-
ups, and if they want to know why it begins with
gruesome first chapter, let them ask the chi
dren like the horrors first and the end all
grown-ups like the tragedy at the end. But perhaps the
children are right and the grown-ups are standing on
their heads. Besides they can skip the first chapter; it is
only a prologue.
