That the Armenians should be constantly appealing to the Power that
had pledged itself for their protection, and that the same Power should be
constantly rallying the others, and making Ambassadorial demonstrations,
was enough to rouse the vilest passions of a nature in which no feelings
except vile passions existed.
Of all sins in this world, perhaps the sin of foolishness receives the
severest punishment, and of all crimes, the crime of failure meets with the
heaviest doom. For their foolishness in trusting in European protection
and hoping for European intervention the unfortunate Armenians paid with
rivers of their own blood, and for their crime of failure they were made to
wallow in that blood. The darkest pages of their history have been written
in the closing years of the nineteenth, and the early years of the twentieth
century ; never since the loss of their independence, nine centuries ago, had
they hoped for so much, and never had they paid so dearly for their folly.
If they had carefully laid to heart the wh history of Europe's inter-
course with Asia, beginning with the conques Macedonian Alexander;
they would have read in the light of sobe
self-interest, and self-
interest only written on every line and
ommitted the folly of
SSOFF.
