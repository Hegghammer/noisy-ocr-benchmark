HORTON ARMS
DERBYSHIRE.
A stag's head cabossed, silver; attired, gold; and, for distinction, a canton ermine.
Crest, out of the waves of the sea proper, a tilting spear erect, gold; enfiled with a dolphin,
silver, finned, gold, and charged with a shell.
[Cabossed means cut off short so as not to show the neck; attired denotes the horns; canton
ermine, means the black spots upon the white field in the left-hand corner. In the picture the
artist has not given the shell upon the dolphin.]
Motto. "QUOD VULT, Valde VULT,"What he wills, he wills cordially and without stint.
Arms are hereditary, but the mottoes are not, and may be changed to suit the taste or fancy of
any family. There are other Arms of the Horton family, varying somewhat from the above. The
date of the grant of the arms I have not found probably many centuries ago.
