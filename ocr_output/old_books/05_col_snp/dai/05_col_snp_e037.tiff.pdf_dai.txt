THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.

Oriental figure of speech, is said to have been ravished by the beauty
of her sandals.' Like the belles of Egypt she did not disdain, in setting
off her charms, to have recourse to perfumes and cosmetics, and
previously to setting out she anointed herself with precious ointment."
In another place Jezebel is said to paint her eyelids; and Solomon, in
the Proverbs, in describing the deceitful woman, adjures his son not to
be taken with her eyelids,' evidently alluding to the use of collyrium.
The Jewish beauty owed no slight obligation to her luxuriant tresses,
which were decorated with waving plumes and strings of pearls; and
in allusion to this custom, followed among the tribes from time imme-
morial, St. Paul affirms that a woman's ornament is her hair.' Judith
braided the hair of her head and put a tire upon it, and the headdress
of Pharaoh's daughter, in the Canticles, is compared by Solomon to
Carmel. No mention is made of Judith's mirror, but it was undoubtedly
made of brass, like those described in Exodus xxxviii. 8 as the
looking-glasses of the women which assembled at the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation.'"
