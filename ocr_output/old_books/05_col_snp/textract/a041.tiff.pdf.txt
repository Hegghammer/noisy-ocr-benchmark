like a round bow, il great brown eye revealed the inward spirit's intelligenco aud zeal un-
quenched. On his head was a close-titting cap of purple velvet.
Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest men-Merditch
Khrimiau, Katholikos of the Armeniam Charch, and soul of the Armenian people-slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or "The Ouly-Begotten
is
Descended." From the window of a neighboring room he might have looked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now all ent close and huried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling snow and hurricane that
hid
the
cone of Arata And jitst beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge.
On
the
shore of that lake, eighty-seyer years ago, Khrimian was borm. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land; the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Greece from
his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom-an
reputation which still rather pathetically strvives throughout the Near East. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos now looked back, but not
unhappy,
for
from first to last it had been inspired by one absorbing and unselfish aim-the freedom
and
regencration of his people. It is tree he had failed.
From his carliest years, when he had witnessed the terrors of Turkish oppresion
in
the
homes of Armenians round Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality-such
a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance among the
prosperons
and
contented
of
the
world.
He
began
as
il
poet,
wandering
far
and
wide
through
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jerusalent,
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wife's death, he devoted himself to the building of sehools,
which he generously threw open to Kurds, the hereditary assassins of Armemans.
For
many
vears, while Europe was occupied with Crimean wars, Austrian wars, or French
and
Germau
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying from Van to Coustantinople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emblems of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of
dogs.
When elected Armenian patriareh of Constantinople (1869), he was driven from
his office nfter four vears.
But the eup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiloss slangliter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European l'owers could -tand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian fonnd
himself summoned to plead his people's cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Europe
beforchand, urging them to create :111 autonomous nentral state for Armenia, as they had
done with succes for the Lebanou. In London he became acqualated with Gladstone ; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the lourt of Eugland, and,
in the Congress itself Khrinian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey's definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London amid shouts of "Peace with Honor,'
and Armenia was left to stew.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, bamished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Chureh and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake
