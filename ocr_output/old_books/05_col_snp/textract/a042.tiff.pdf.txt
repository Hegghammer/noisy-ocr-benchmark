Van, and the lowest estimate counted the murdered dead nt 100,000. Gladstone made the
last great speech of his heroie life. England attempted some kind of protest. But rather
than
join
the Liberal demand for action, Lord Rosebery left his party for .private leisure, and
Russia, France, und Germany combined to secure immunity for the "great assassin." It
was the lowest point of Europe's shame.
Blow followed blow. Hardly had the remmant of the Armenian people escaped from
massacre when their Church fell under the Irrutal domination of Russia. Plehve ordained its
destruction, and Golitzin was sent to Tiflis as governor-general to carry it out. Church
property to the value of £1,000,000 was seized by violence, the Katholikos resolutely refusing
to give lip the kers of the safe where the title deeds were kept (June, 1903). For two years
the Russian officials played with the revenues, retaining eiglity per cent. for their
own
ndvantage. But in the mean time assassination had rid the earth of Plehye, and the over-
whelming defeats of Russia in Manehruria were attributed to the Armenian eurse. Grudgingly
the Church property was restored, in utter chaos, and for the moment it is Inssin's policy to
favor the Armenians as a balance against the Georgians, whom the St. Petersbarg government
is now deternimed to destroy.
Such was the past upon which the worn old man, stretehed on his monastic bed, looked
back that winter's morning. Singleness of aim has its reward in spiritual peace, but of the
future he was not hopeful. He no longer even contemplated an autonomoas Armenia, either
on
Turkish
territory or on Russiaii. On the Russian side of the frontier the Armenian
villages were too scattered, too much interspersed with Georgians and Tartars, to allow
of autonomy. On the Turkish side, he thought, massacre and exile had now left too few of
the
race
to
form any kind of community. Indeed, for the last twelve years the Armenian
villagers have been crawling over the foot of Ararat by thousands a year to escape the Kurds,
and every morning they conie and stand in fresh groups of pink and blue rags outside the
monastery door where the head of their Chureh and race lies dying. They stand there in
mute appeal, as I them, possessing nothing in the world but the variegated tatters
that cover them, and their faith in their Katholikos. Slowly they are drafted nway into
Tiflis, Baku, or their Caucasian villages, but nowhere are they welcomed.
Some
of the bishops and monks, who form a council round their eliief, still look for
Europe's
interference, and trust that the solemn pledges taken by Eugland and other Powers
at Berlin may be fulfilled. The Bishop of Erivan, for instance, still Inbors for the appoint-
ment of a Christian governor over the district marked by the ill-omened names of Van,
Bitlis,
and Erzeroum. I also found that even among the Georgians there was a large party willing
to concede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian villages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Cancasus wins federal
autonomi, But the majority of the Armenian clergy, who litherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and industries. One ennnot ret say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolutionary parties of "The Bell" and "The Flag." Of these,
the Social Democratic Bell" follows the usnal impracticable and pedantie creed of St. Marx.
The
' Flag,"
or
party
of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a great
assembly held in Erivan last August (1906) they adopted a progranime of 'land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected laymen. If the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.
Whatever nay be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
