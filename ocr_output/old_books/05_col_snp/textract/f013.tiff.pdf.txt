PREFACE
ix
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific his-
torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and exalted the villains, for whom of old no
mud was too thick and slab. Beliefs are being
ussaileil on every side. To abolish the traditional
courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the considerate
conduct of Captain Hind would, therefore, be
strokes of the unkindest, and I have here attempted
no such iconoclusm. Even where I cannot be-
lieve, I have told the tale-whenever it has been
worth the telling-as it is found in criminal
trials, or in Smith or Johnson, and other old
sources, decorously stripped of much vile language.
For really, where much that seems incredible
meyy be fully proved, and where the belierable
turns out not rurely to be fulse, 'tis your only way.
To continute the story of the lighwaymen from
Smith und Johnson down to the "pproaching end
of all such things in the beginning of the nine-
teenth century, is like taking up and concluding
a half-told tale. But it was worth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpin has
always maile, has it been found really necessary
to seriously consider and re-state the curcer of
that much-overrated scoundrel, and to put him
in his proper place : " very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
