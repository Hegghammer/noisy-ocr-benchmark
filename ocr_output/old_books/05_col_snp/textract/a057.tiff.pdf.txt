Church, but was also a fearless patriot- distinguished linguist, an eloquent preacher, and x
thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was bre who, in
spite of the feared fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudeuce to the wiuds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history,
At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Tarkish delegates were thunderstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinonle, seut
by Monseigneur Nercès, the Patriareh, their object being to request the signatory l'owers of
the Berlin Treaty to force a guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.
Abdul Hamid and his advisers were furious at thris affront, and Monseigneur Nerces was
summoned to the Palnce. It is said that when he received the summons he simply shiled
and asked one of of his eurates to read the Burial Service to him, as lie did not expect to
return alive. However, he went. No one has ever heard what passed between the Sultan
and himself at the interview suffice it to say that he immediately summoned the Armenian
General
Assembly and tendered his resignation. This was not accepted by the Assembly,
and, amidst enthusiastic cheers, he was carried back to his apartments at the Patriarchate.
Meanwhile a peremptory order reached him, signed hs the Sultan, to recall the Armenian
delegation from Berlin. This Monseigneur Varjabétian point-blank refased to do, and retired
to his private residence at Haskeuy, il village on the Golden Horn. The success of the dele-
gation, howeyer, did not come up to his expectations. The Armenians, as it liappened, could
not be heard, but they were so far successful as to have an article inserted in the treaty.
The Sultan and his advisers never forgave the Patriareh this, though they coald not
openly do anything to him on account of his enormous popularity. Time passed on, and to
all appearanee the incident was forgotten, but it was not so. One summer afternoon a most
cordial invitation was sent by a very high dignitary of the Palace, requesting the Arehbishop
to dine with him informally. An invitation of this kind could not very well be refused, so
the Archbishop, accompanied only by a body-servant named Vartan, repaired to the Pasha's
honse. The Pasha received him at the door and escorted the visitor with much ceremony and
extreme courtesy to a private apartment of the salamlik of his house (the men's quarters),
where dimner was served. The geniality displayed by his host dispeHed any fears that the
Archbishop might have had as to his personal safety.
After diuner, as usual, coffee was served. Now, this serving of the coffée is rather a
ceremonial according to high Turkish etiquette, and it is not unusal for guests to bring their
own tchooboukdar (the servant who carries bis master's pipe and poueb and also superintends
the making of his coflee). The Archbishop was presented with a "tehoohouk" (pipe) filled
and lighted for smoking, and n servant followed with collee. The Archbishop accepted hoth
with dne compliments to his host, and took a sip at his coffee. Just at that moment the
heayy curtains over the doorway were thrown apart, revealing the ghastly pale face of his
servant Vartan, who cried, in Armentan, in a voice trembling with emotion, "Monseigneur,
I did not brew the coffee !
This was enough for the Archbishop he pretended to lie startled and spilt the coffee, but,
alas ! he had already a small quantity of it. Moanwhile il souille was going on behind
the portière, where his poor servant Vartan was paying the penalty of his devotion to his
master. Concerning Vartan's whereabouts or lis ultimate end nothing was ever nade public
the poor fellow simply vanished. Monseigneur Varjabétian, after a short interval thanked
the Pasha for hris generons and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
Was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily summoned. The Patriareli took to his bed,
and lost all his hair through the effects of the poison. Then, one morning, when a servant
