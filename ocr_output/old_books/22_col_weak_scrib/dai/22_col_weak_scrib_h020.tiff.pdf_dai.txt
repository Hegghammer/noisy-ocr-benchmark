all living and dying in the old mansion ! Could those old was re-
echo all the words ever spoken there, and exhibit anew all the scenes
ever witnes there the book containing such a record would vastly
exceed in columg the size of the old castle. It would bring to light
much that How in darkness, and must forever remain hidden from
the generations of the living.
At the death of Jonathan G. Horton, the old homestead became,
by will, the property of the Rev. Mrs. Williams, of Brooklyn, N. Y.,
who was the adopted daughter of Jonathan G. Horton, he në
havinnaman that on the 3d of July, 1873, the old homestead
went out of the Horton name.
Mrs. Williams proposes to sell it, and if some of the Hortons do
not buy it, it will indicate a lack of decent respect for the old castle,
If not for the Horton name. It should be bought bark into the
Horton name, suitably repaired and preserved for the wonder and
admiration of generations of mindent
Horton, the short, thick man, and Stuart T. Terry, are the two men
seen in the engraving, in front of the old house.
Mr. Swart T. Terry, of Southold, L., L., has kindly copied and for-
warded to me, many interesting facts from the New Haven Colonial
Records, some of which are here inserted :
“Concerning some farmers neere Southold, at a place called Hash-
amamock, aboute whom BARNAñAS Horton, one of ye Constables list
yeare, which was 1656, also, Constable in 1659. 29 May, 1661, Bar-
nabas Horton was a. Depuity to the New Haven Court-also, 21 May,
1654 the Deputies from Southold, presented to ye court of righting
from their towne, wherein it is desired that BARNABAS HORTON and
JOHN PEAKEN, the two present Deputies of Southold, may be chosen
Constables for that plantation; which was done. Barnabas Horton
was a Deputy to the Court in New Haven, in 1651-36
1661 In 1655 there was no election, but he wrote a letter to the
Court on public airs In 1662 he was admitted a Freeman of Con-
nectiont Cology at Harford, and in 1663 and 1664 he was a Depny
to the General Court, at Harford. He was a Magistrate in 1664, and
until his death. He is one of the Patentees of the Town of Southold
in 1876," Made his will May 19, 1680. Died 13 July, 1680. Will
