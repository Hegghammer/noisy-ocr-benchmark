RESEATING A CHAIR; CANE WEBBING
The seating of chairs with machine woven cafe is a much sien
process than that of hand caning them. Under similar conditions
less time and skill are required on areas of like dimensions. Machine
waven cane, as its name implies, is a manufactured product made
on power looms or machines. Commercially it is sold under the
name of cane webbing. It is obtainable in widths ranging from
8 in., increasing by 2 in., to 18 in., and in rolls of indefinite lengths.
It may be procured in meshes of varying fineness, utilizing cane of
various sizes. In specifying open woven cane it is necessary that
the purchaser indicate his wants in essentially this way: Ten feet
medium open woven cane webbing, of No. 1 fine cane, 12 in, wide,
A roll of such cane has been referred to in Fig. 18.
Cane webbing may also be purchased in close woven, in both the
plain and diagonal weaves. The specifications for purchasing are
identical with the open woven except that the term close woven
is specified together with the character of weave. Fig. 27 show's
cane webbing approximately half size, in open and close woven
meshes.
As in hand caning, any boy with proper inclination who has had
the necessary experience in the shops, may avail himself of the
opportunities for seating chairs in his community. The educational
and pecuniary advantages are identical to those mentioned in rela-
tion to hand caning. The relative ease with which he may acquire
skill in handling the materials precludes satisfactory workmanship
for prospective customers.
The cost of jobs is readily determined, for the amount and cost
of webbing is easily ascertained, and experience soon determines
the length of time required. Cane webbing costs approximately
