PREFACE,
ting
writing in praise of the moderate use of Corsets ok facts,
experiences, and grounds of argument from the very-day life and
general custom of the present period.
The Crinone is too closely associated with the Corset and with the
mutable modes affected by ladies, from season to season, to be omitted
from any volume which treats of Fashion. The same facts, indeed, may be
stated of both the Crinoline and the Corset. Both appear to be equally
indispensabla na the woman of the present period. To make them
serve the purposes of increased cleanliness, comfort, and grace, not only
without injury to the health, but with positive and admitted advantage
to the physique these are the problems to be solved by those whose
business it is to minister to the ever-changing taste and fashion of
the day.
