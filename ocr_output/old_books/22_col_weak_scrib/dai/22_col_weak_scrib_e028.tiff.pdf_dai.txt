The Persians entertain much the same notions with regard to the
necessity for slenderness of form in the belles of their nation, but differ in
other matters from the Hindoos. The following illustration represents a
dancing-girl of Persia, and it will be seen that her figure bears no
indication of neglect of cultivation. It is somewhat curious that the
Chinese, with all their extraordinary ingenuity, have confined their
restrictive efforts to the feet of the ladies, leaving their waists unconfined.
That their doing so is more the result of long-established custom than
absence of admiration for elegantly-proportioned figures will be clearly
proved by the following extract from a letter published in Chambers
Journal, written by a genuine inhabitant of the Celestial Empire,
named Woo-tan-zhin, who paid a visit to England in 1844-45. Thus
he describes the ladies of Englan
“Their eyes, having the blue tint of the waters of autumn, are
charming beyond description, and their waists are laced as tight and thin
as a willow branch. What, perhaps, caught my fancy most was the
sight of elegantly-dressed young ladies, with pearl-like necks and tight-
laced waists; nothing can possibly be so enchanting as to see ladies that
compress themselves into taper forms of the most exquisite
like of which I have never seen before.”
By many writers it has been urged that the admiration so generally
felt for slenderly-proportioned and taper waists results from an artificial
taste set up by long custom; but in Woo-tan-zhin's case it was
clearly not so, as the small-waisted young ladies of the "outer
barbarians" were to him much as some new and undescribed flowers or
birds wou
be to the wondering naturalist who first beheld them.
