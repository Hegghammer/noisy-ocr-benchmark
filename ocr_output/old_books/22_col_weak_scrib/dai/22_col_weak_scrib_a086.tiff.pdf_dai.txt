meaning; sometimes modes of expression are so difficult to translate from
one language into another, and it can be said that the term "Illuminator" is
used for want of a better word in English. The Armenians call their
religion "loois havat" the word "loois means "light" and
faith" or "religion," but if I translated the twofords as
"enlightened faith" oror

suitably convey the meaning of the original.

THE CATHEDRAL OF ETCHMIATZIS.
(Only Begotten Descended).

luminator who built the Church in the third century of the Christian era.
B!
The cathedral of Etchmiatzin is identified with Gregory; its name
"Etchmiatzin means in the Armenia que the only begotten is
descended," and the story attached to it is, that in a vision Christ appeared
to Gregory escended in light; Gregory built his church on the spot where
the vision had appeared to him, giving it the name of "Etchmiatzin" (only)
begotten descended). The cathedral also gives its name to the town
Etchmiatzin, the ecclesiastical metropolis of Armenia.
