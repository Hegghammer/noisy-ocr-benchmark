SCENE OF THE MASSACRES IN ASTA MINOR.
The trouble began in Adana. An armed m√∏b strengthened and augmented by soldiers
fell in overwhelming numbers upon the marmed Christians. The Armenian population of
Antisch and vicinity were practically wiped out and the Armenian villages in the
Alexandretta district destroyed with immense loss of life. Hadjin, les ab and the neigh-
bouring villages were burnel. The Armenian quarter in Tarsus was ruined and in-opened
Marash stained again with the blood of thousands of Armenians, Zeitdon
entire population of Kirikon between Aleppo and Alexandreta were massacred to the last
Inthe. The mob and the soldiers burned what they could not carry away, so that the material'
loss has been enormous. In place of the former abundance and thriving industries there are
instead desolated provinces and the charred and blackened remains of pillaged and ruined
homes, and the residue of those who escaped massaere are reduced to homelessness and
starvation.
