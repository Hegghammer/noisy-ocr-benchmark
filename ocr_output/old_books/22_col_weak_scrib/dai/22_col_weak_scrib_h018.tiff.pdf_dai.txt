Proface. Introduction,

It is said that Barnabas Horton I, was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities.
His tomlistone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton,
It is elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. The original base was of brick, but it had all crumbled down
many years ago The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G, Horton.
The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads as
follows:
Here Hath buried the body of MR. BARNABAS HORTON, who was born at
Manson England, and died af Samboll, on the 13th day of
July, 1680, ague So years.”
In the centre of the stone we find the Epitaph, as follows:
- Here lies my body tombol ſu dast
MTR Charis sha" come to raise it with the fast;
My soni ascended time
Where with sweet Jesus now I'make aboda:
Then hasten after nie, way dearest wife,

An 3 yum, dear childhou, all follow the Lord,
Hear and obey His public stered word;
And in your homses cal' upou His name,
For off I have advised you to the same:
Than God will these you with your ceildren af,
And in this blossel plece. He wil" you call."

It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the original
thirteen who brought his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and memory
should not post from the earth.
