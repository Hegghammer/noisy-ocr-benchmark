Khrimian, Katholikus of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian penting
like a round bow, a great brown eye revealed the inward spirit's intelligence and zeal un-
quenched. On his head was a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.
Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest men-Mer Hitch
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery callet Etchmiatzin, or "The Begotten
is Descended." From the window of a neighboring room he chake booked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the viues were now at it close and buried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stool a dark mass of whirling snow and hurricane that hid the
cone of Ararg. And just beyond Ararat les Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of the lake eighty-seven years agy, Khrimian was born. In 1829 the Turkish
Empire was still diminished by sea or land; the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom-a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Near East. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos now looked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to last it had been inspired by one absorbing and unselfish aim--the freedom and
It is true he had failed.
From his earliest years, when he had witnessed the terrors of Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round Ararut, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality such a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance among the
prosperous and contented of the world. He began as a poet, wandering for and wide rough
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems the secues and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wife's death, he devoted himself to the building of schools,
which he generously throw open to The Ludkan
14 menians. For many
â˜‘ ears, while Europe was occupied with Crimean wars, Austrian wars, or French and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying from Van to Constantinople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools buried, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emblens of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenian patriarch of Constantinople (1869), he was driven from
his office after four years.
But the cup of Turkish iniquity was tilling. The pitiless slaughter of Bulgations and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khaingiant
himself summoned to plead his people's cause before the Congress of Berlin, Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited the great courts of
beforehand, urging them to create an autonomous neutral state for Armenia, as they had
done with success for the Lebanon. In London he became quainted with Gladstone ; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had killed the heart of England, and
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey's definite reforms. It is needles n That trone of these promises and
pledges were obserted Beaconsfield returned to London amid shouts of "Peace with Honor,

rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, lie

crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake
