CANING SUGGESTIONS
As weaving progresses difficulty will be experienced invinsertingy ~~
ends in the holes, due to their becoming filled. Force the

In many instances long ends of cane remain from one series to
another. These generally, as previously mentioned, should be used
in succeeding steps. Vhere is one limitation. They should be
used provided it is not necessary to carry them over more than four
holes on the under side of the frase. The fewer louse ends left,
the better, for the caning is thereby neater and better. It is gener-
ally advisable tu use a full length strand to avoid a number of
loose ends. .

the diagonals at the edges; that is, immediately upon entering or
leaving a hele. Many commendable pteces of caning are spoiled
by ragged, improperly woven edges. Care must be taken to see
that the cane goes »ver and under the proper strand or strands at
these points. Fig. 6 clearly shows hew the diagonals should ruff“

“Vhe addition of a Barc oe a matter of taste. Perhaps
50 per cent of modey do ecaned furniture does not employ a
binder of any description. The series of regularly exposed holes
are rather pleasing and in no way detract. However, in chair seats
a binder is essential to protect the ends af canes, for they are subject
to hard wear.

Binders of reed of of wood called “‘splines” may be used on hand-
caned frames. Uf either is used a groave 1% in. deep and 3/16 in.
