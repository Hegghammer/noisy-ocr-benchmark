im all the panoply of forest finery, a bolt well drawi~y@4¥% shown in the ,

| tage Or: carelessly or loosely adjusted. Here, then, we find the
| first ifdicarfn of the use of the corset as an article of becoming attire, |
| At the very first dawn of civilisation there are distinct evidenecs of the |
use of contrivances for the reduction and formation of the female figure.
Researches among the mins of Polenqui, one of the mysterious forest cities
of Sonth America, whose history is lost in remote antiquity, huve brouglit
tO Tete most Sieuilar evidences of the existence of a now ant /4
; race. Amongst the works of art discovered there is a bas-relief repre |
senting a female figure, which, in addition to a profusion of massiv
| ornaments, wears a complicated and claborate waist-bandage, which, |
by a system of circular and transverse folding and looping, confines the |
| waist from just belo FRM Mp omy ame“compactly as |
the most unyiekling corset of the present day. |
At the period of the discovery of some of the iskinds of the |
Eastern Archipelago was found customary for all young females to |
| wear a peculiar kind of corset, formed of spirally-arranged rattan
cane, and this, when once put on, was not removed until the celebration
| of the marriage ceremony. Such races as were slowly sof) the
march of civilisation, after discovery by the ecarly_navigatdrs, me
—More and more accustomed to the use af “ait adjust and rerair :
which, waistbands would become essentially rdquate. These, when
made sufficiently broad to fit without undue friction, and stiff enough to
| prevent folding together in the act of stooping, sitting, or moving
about, at once became in effect coffe “inestiettsted to the minds |
| of the ingepos a system of cutting and fitting so as more perfectly to
; adapt vA figure of the wearer. The modes of fastening, as
we shall sce, have been various, from the simple sewing together with
the lace to the costly buckle and jewelled loop and stud. |
