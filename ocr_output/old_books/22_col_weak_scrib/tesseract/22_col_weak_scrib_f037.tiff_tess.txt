DUN 19
as the town was named, @.e. the “ hill-staple ”
or market, and his successors were often thon gee
The wool market was the most important :
Dunstable —the monks long maintaining great
flocks oO) on the adjacent downs.

The ers became only a memory, but a
memory that never faded. It merely took on
another form, and in the course of time the name
of the town itself was twisted imto an allusion
to then_and fotheir leader. It needed the col-
lusion of gross ignorance and wild legend to effeet
so much, but the thing was done; and for cen-
turies Dunstable was, and perhaps even now is,

| locally said to owe its name to ‘ Dun’s Stable,”
a hollow in the chalk dgwns, pointed out as haying
been the place where “ Dun,” the entirely ima-
C / ginary leader of the outlaws, stabled his horse.
£ you doubt this there is the town seal to con-
vince the secpticat, Showing as it does what is
said to be a horseshoe (a shoe of Dun’s horse!),
but is really intended for a staple or hasp.

The legendary Dun was a kind of bogey to (])
the children of the neighbourhood, and in Jobn-
sows pases is a most bloodthirsty em).
There we read that his first exploit was onthe
highway to Bedford, where he met a waggon full
of corn, going to market, drawn bya fine team
of horses. Ife accosted the waggoner, and in the
midst offi stabbed him to the heart
withadaggeh Iie buried the body, and drove the
waggon off to the town, where he sold the corn
and the waggon as well, and then disappeared !
