The efforts of the Armenians, and the cnireaties of their Patriarch
Nerses had procured the insertion of Article 16 in the ‘Treaty of San
Stefano signed between Russia and Vurkey in March 1878. In hae
wording of the Article had been suggested by the Patriarch Ypdvectt™ |
provided the following stipulation for the protectiog of thacdeeAfenians :—

“As the evacuation by the Russian troops athe territory which they
now occupetd Armenia, and which is to be restored to Turkey, might give
rise to fofflic)s and complications detrimental to the maintenance of yood
relation betyeen the two countrics, the Sublime Porte cogases to carry into
effect witWOut further delay the improvements and reforms demanded by
local requirements in the provinces inhabited by the Armentans, and to
cuarantee their security against the Kurds and Circassians.”

What followed has passed into history. ‘The British Government of
whielaLett seeeoisficld (then Mr. J)"Israeli) was Premicr, and Lord Salis-

the Treaty of San Stefano. ‘Thus the substantial cuarantee of a natural and
immediate protector, boaLAkh aa laarumolunioxcinnbe protection which
the Armenians then had in Russia, was taken away, and the security of im-

«The Sublime Porte undertakes to carry ont without further delay the
improvements aaderefarms demanded by local requirements in the provinces
inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the

‘The insertion of Article G1 in the ‘Treaty of Berlin, granted, or rayfer
scemingly cranted, by the six Powers of Europe, proved in reality, as pub-
