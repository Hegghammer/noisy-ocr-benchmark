MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE.

hhowili be seen by the cnpraving that thie old) house ts domale. “The
western part is that which was built by Barnabas in 1659-60. ‘Vhe
cast OF TWO pA pA A by Jonathan f., about 1682. Phe apper
room ot this part was used for a court: house for nearly twenty years,
as we learn trom Vhompson’s History of Long Estland, and some of
the old benches used when tt was a conrt-house are still preserved.
The old “castle,” as Jonathan G. Morton, its Jast Florron occupant,
