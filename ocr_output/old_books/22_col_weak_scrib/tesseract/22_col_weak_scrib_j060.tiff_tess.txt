Primitive Methods.——Briefly the primitive process of convert:
ing the rattan, or raw material, into cane and reeds, or the finished
product, is this: The rattan stems are thoroly dried or seasoned,
and the nodules are pared off with a peculiar native knife, Then the

| rattan is sorted into sizes and selection made as to grade. The sort-

ing is based upon external color and diameter of the rattan. ‘lhe

rattan is then immersed in water, and rhe stem is rubbed vigorously

with sand and cocoanut husks to remove dirt and foreign substances.

ts then bleached by means of sulphur fumes, cither in the stem or
feviv peel and core have been prepared,

1 method of preparing the peel and core is this: The peel, or
outer covering, is cemoved with aheayy knife; it is then stripped to
selected thicknesses and widths by drawing it by hand thru two
knives set aterequired distances apart. “Vhis peel is commercially
called cane. The core is then stripped into as many strands as
necessary, depending upon the diameter of the cores required.
These are rounded by drawing them thru a shect-of tin or tron
perforated with holes of different diameters. The rounded cores
are called reeds.

Considerable rdttan is still converted into the finished products
by hand processes thru these laborious stages. Machines have been
perfected which do practically the entire work. Particularly have
the Germans brought this industry to a perfected state. Still in
various sections of Fndia, China, and the Philippines hand working
of rattan is a thriving industry; an industry seemingly peculiarly’ "+
adapted to the natives. (hg Philippine method of preparing the
raw material varies ena a the Chinese method in that the
natives du not bleach Zhe Yatran.

Reed may be procured in Jarge or sinall hanks, im coils and in
bundles, with the cost determined by weight. Schools generally
will find it advantageous to buy it in small hanks, because of ease in
handling and for economic reasons. Round reeds are shown
