2 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS,

the scene of which, by the way, he has not represented as a royal menagerie, but as a wild,
rocky cavern—his animals partake of the artificial character of which we cannot bring ourselves to
approve. .

Of this fact, however, we purpose to exhibit proof with our assertion. Improved versions, to
the best abilities of our Artists, of some of these Lious of Rusens and the Assyrian king, will here
be introduced, which the reader, who pleases, may eompare with the originals. Our second, third,
and fourth Plates are of the number.

The Lions of Rusens are Aumanized. We do not intend to discuss at length whether the
ideality of allegorical painting required this: we only state the fact: yet the opinions which we
felt at liberty to form on the subject, we fecl at liberty to utter. So much in apology for using the
licence of asserting that the heads of many of the Lions of Rubens rather resemble those of frowning
old yentlemen decorated with Ramillies wigs ; as if Nature’s journeymen had made manes, and not
made them well. There is a profusion of flowing and cuglgm hair, ch seems rather to solicit
the unguents of the perfumer, than to bave endured thé meter desert, or the rough
storms of the forest. The shag pf a Lion} sa very different sort of thing.

However such dressed LioGAfay Ne thought to accord with Allegory, they are demonstrably
Avariance with Nature. ‘To be'sure, what might become a Lion in the procession of the Cardinal

rtues, night be rather unsuitable in lis den, or within the precincts of those wild haunts, where he

is accustomed to roam in his natural state. We have often read of the fabled Men-bulls, or (Mino-

tanrs,) and we find such on the coinage of Crete. These allegorical creatures of Runens, which,

alas! have sometimes been quoted by Artists without half his genius, and placed in savage con-
