THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE, 29
| Oriental figure of speech, is said to have been ‘ravishyg by We i‘ “uty
| of her sandals.” Like the belles of Egypt she did not dain, in setting
| oit her chgems, to have recourse to perfumes and cosmetics, and
: reso set)ing out she ‘anointed herself with precious ointment.’
| In anotheNpbet Jezebel is said to ‘paint her eyelids ;? and Solomon, in
the Proverbs, in describing the deceitful woman, adjures his son not to |
be ‘taken with her eyclids,’ evidently alluding to the use of collyrium.,
| The Jewish beauty owed no slight obligation to her luxuriant tresses,
|  whicbyectprdecpyated with waving plumes and strings of pearls; and
in allusion to this custom, followed among the tribes from time imme-
mortal, St. Paul affirms that a woman’s ornament is her hair. Judith
braided the hair of her head and put a tire upon it;’ and the headdress
| of Pharaoh’s daughter, in the Canticles, is compared by Solomon to
Carmel, No mention is made of Judites mirror, but it was yndoubtedly
made of brass, like those described in Exodus xxxvill. 8 as ‘the
| / looking-glasses of the women which assembled at the door of the
ernacle of the congregation.’ ”
