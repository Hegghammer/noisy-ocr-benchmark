CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. 38

Every artist does best, that which he is best qualified and best disposed to do. In com-
pleting the number of plates that has been found necessary for the Work, Mr. Epwin LaNpSEER
has chosen to proceed toward the same purpose, upon a different principle. He has gone, without
any introductory medium, directly to the living animals, and has exhibited the savage manners and
habits of these quadrupeds, according to his own ideas and observations.

On the distinction between Cuaracrer and EXPression, we shall now deliver our opinion.
By the Character of an animal, we mean those permanencies of his look and features which he
always offers to view when in a placid, or unimpassioned state: by his Lapression, the variations
of muscular action superinduced on character, to which he is liable, as the storms of passion sweep
by, and his mind becomes agitated by external circumstances acting on the ardours of his instinct.

The former, seems to hold its court in the solid and massy parts: the latter, agitates, oft-
times rebelliously, the nerves and muscles. Character is ever present, both in the animal coun-
tenance, and in the “human face divine.” The most violent expression does not proscribe, or
obliterate, character. Individuality consists of it, as fur as concern: organ: and it
forms the system of vowels of the language of Nature, withé no Expression could be.

Whoever regards the faces of a flock of § PBisec in them an infinite variety of Character,
with vey Expression, and that little *Mhout diversity: and if we descend a step lower in
the scale of befhe, and contemplate the finny tribe, where Character is not wanting, we find no
Expresh ‘all. Even Trees and inanimate objects, possess Character. We recollect a poctical
friend of ours, now in Italy, saying that every tree and every rock had a fuec—but of this we are
not so certain; though very certain, that there is enough of Character in rocks and trees, to make
renin

Character and Expression, in the carnivorous class of animpls/4o which we here solicit
attention, are always co-existent — their proportions varying wifh/the existing oceasions —in

| pictorial exhibitions of such subjects.

Tiere is much Chazacter, and little Expression, in the reposing Leopard with his sheathed
claws, which is shewn in the present engraving, copied by Mr. Srizseury from TupivGer, and
corrected from Nature. RiprxcER was an artist of gyfatf power, who studied wild animals in
their sequestered haunts, as is shewn in his grand forfst Yack-efouydeand who, generally

—speaking, left little or no room for others to iffy except on congfiow TD lige works.
