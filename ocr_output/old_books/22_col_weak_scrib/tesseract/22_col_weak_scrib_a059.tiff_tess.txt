“Oh that head were waters and imine eyes a fountain of tears, that
Limight weef My jad night for the slain of my people.”

A book has been written and published in Japan, its tile " Niku Dan”
translated into Tnglish, reads, “Tluman Bullets.” This little book, a
narrative of the siege of Port Arthnr, after being read through the lenvth
and breadth of the empire, found translators to translate it into the best
known SPOS tnd its youns author, himself an actor in the siege,
was summoned to the presence of his sovereign to be thanked and praiseY
The book is a vraphic narrative of the most terrible sieve in history, whdrdin
is vividly portrayed the deadly strugele of the besiegers. It contains aNan
acknowledgement of its merit, a page on which is recorded the Ield
Marshal's appreciation, and another page bearing the Commanding General's -
commendation,

In simple narrative the author carries the: reader through appatling

ccnes of horror, and as we read we are made to realize the slaughter of
The Enemy's machine guns, of their ground-mines, clectricwire entangle-
ments, and exploding shells ; we are made to hear the roar of the artillery
tire dealing deatn and destruction, and there rises before us the mental viston
of the fierce hand to hand contlict, and the dead and dying lytygythjckly tn
the dark ravine. ;
“Vor hill and battle plain, /

= — With dying men and slain, S

Grew mountain heights of Raby
And mine is boundless woe.”

Vhe grim warrior who stormed and took the most impregnable fortress
in the world gives expression to his feclias\entra—oetereat achicvemmnt,
in saddest werds

“And mince is boundless woe,”

Vor theferiay warrior’s heart is elett in twain for the humaa builets that

under his command hurled themselves to their death.
