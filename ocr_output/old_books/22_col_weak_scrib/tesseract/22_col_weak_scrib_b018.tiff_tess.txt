Two Covcnant Lions, arrer RuBens, taken from his celebrated picture before alluded
. to, of the Prophet Daniel incarcerated in the den. The Lions are here supposed to be miraculously
held in a state of tranquillity. Here, too, is not much Expression, but an extraordinary grandeur
of Character, suited to the greatness of an occasion where the Deity himself especially interferes
to seal up the voracious energies of the most terrible of his creatures, in calm submission. There
is a character of royal dignity mingled with this submission, which is very impressive, and even
sublime.

The writer estcems this to be a successful restoration of the Nature that was wanting in the
prints of this subject, (which has often been engraved by Picaxr and others,) after Rubens. The
original picture it has been our ill-fortune never to have seen. ‘The shaggy manes, and the latent
terror that sits gloomily enthroned in the open eyes of the superior Lion—suited to the darkness of
the den, and the nature of this animal’s sense of vision, TIE tons of, as they are
executed ; and are varied with much address fpom theglaed eyes he couching Lion beyond,
of which also the character is qnost hap@harked. A powerful and divine spell possesses

Tne Tiger wiiclt MARCHES IN OUR PROCESSION, without an object before him to call
forth eingtion, possesses 2 calm character, combined with the resistless strength of that dreadful
qnadruped ; whose very tranquillity, in his leisure saunterinf, When no excitement is acting on his
nerves, las an appalling effect.—His brow is clouded, thoferh his claws are sheathed. ‘There is a
possibility of a dreadful storm which may not be far ditant, and that is enough to stamp the
‘Tiger’s character. None shall dare to arouse his energies, nor to encounter them when aroused.
