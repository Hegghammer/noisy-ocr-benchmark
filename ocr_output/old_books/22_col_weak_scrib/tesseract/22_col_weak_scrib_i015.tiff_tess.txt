Remember that they know not what they do
Who strike-tydoadly fear and ghastly hate;
Remember that somchow, and at some time,
Each crime exacts its human penalty.
| Remember that man’s conscience and man’s mind
Are agents of Thy purpose and Thy plan,
ary - . » PV, O01 OOO OW
Which work within a deadlier revenge
i any shrapnel shot or sabre thrust.
Remember that new generaijons come
Upon whom fall the burden and the curse,
The anguish of old hatreds and past wrongs,
The crushing debt, the struggle and despair.
Restrain, O God, the sweep of this vast hate;
Recalfthe natiens to their sense of shame: O
To those in blinding war, to us at peace,
Reveal anew the message of the Christ.
