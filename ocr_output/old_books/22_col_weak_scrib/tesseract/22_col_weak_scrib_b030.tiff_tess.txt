8 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

the position of the head. In all gramnivorous animals, the skin of the head is closely attached to
the skull, and capable only of very limited motion: the eye is almost uniformly mild, and the lips
unmoved by passion.

“Tt is in carnivorous animals, with whose habits and manner of life, ferocity is instinctively
comecttd, ns the great means of their subsistence, that rage is distinguished by the most
remarkable strength of expression. The eye-ball is terrible, and the retraction of the flesh of the
lips indicates the most savage fury. Dut the first, is merely the exerted attention of the animal;
and the other a preparatory exposure of the canine teeth. ‘The great animals of prey —the Lion
and the Tiger—are quite ineapable of any other expression of feature, than this particular display
of ferociousness. When they fawn upon their keeper, there is no motion in their features that ra
indicates aifection.”

In this assertion, that the countenances of the great animals of prey are incapable of any
other than ferocious expression, we do not quite coincide Cine iorei physiologist. When
they fawn upon their keeper, we think that ipdigdaietts of aifekn are exhibited; and find
ourselves ready to ask what elseffiay buyt@*xpression is that “licking of the hand” which our
author has before mentioned. S however, we should grant that they may not be capable of
affectionate expression toward their keeper, we ean scarcely doubt that—toward their young —if

fe could observe them in their wild state, and in their moments of playful intercourse and

enjoyment amoug each other—they ure: at least, we think there are motions in their features that

indicate affection, as well as fear, enquiry, surprise, gratitude, pleasurable wantonness, and some
other_sentiments, or emotions. This is our conyiction: at the same time, we perceive that the

ie eaten ferocious expression far exceeds the savage cy of their domestic charities. Are
not even the least of these observable in the habits ph of the domestic Cat, who belongs

to the Tiger genera? But we have even seen a Tiger iMhis den, who looked good-natured enough

to be stroked and patted: and of the Lion, of whom Mn. Grivrrvn relates the following anecdote,

“ Tfearing some noise under his eage, the Lion passed his paw between the bars, and actually :
hauled up his keeper who was cleaning beneath ; but as soon as he perceived that he had thus ill
ust Tis Thaster, he instantly lay down upon his back in an attitude of complete submission.”

Or what can be said of the circumstancgfpentipned by SENECA (of which he was personally
witness), of a Lion, to whom a man, who rage erttis eper, was exposed for destruction
in the amphitheatre at Rome; ay 10 wis Ca fmf but defended and

broken loose, submitting to the Ci allowing himself to td back peaceably to his place of
confinement?
