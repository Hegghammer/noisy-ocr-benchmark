WHY AND TS ee
In makingistudy of my race, [have found three marked characteristics
nti Combined with these three characteristics
is an intens& ve of Nationality. We live in a complex world. Tn an
independent people these characteristics and this sentiment are laudable
Virtues. Ina subject people they are Crimes.
After Thad laid this bitter Truth to heart, I did not have to seek for the
Why att Nanette ef the Armenian Massacres.
Vhe Armenian Massacres stand without their parallel in history. lls
iuman mind staggers to contemplate the fiendish orgies of which they hye
| been the victims, and noe pen can describe their horrors: and this helpless
christian people are to-day in the same deadly peril as they have been since
the famous Treaty of Bert tater notritt tinier anid: foot to the
nffrcy of their executioners.
Jhe Armenians may be led again “as sheep to the slaughter ” and the
work of exterminationemap=be completed—Jesus Christ was crucified on
Calvary and the servant is not greater than his Lord—but the work of their
extermination can only be completed when the evil influences ingye Purkish

point is reached, they must re-act on Christeftt6m and the natural
consequence must follow. Those who sow the wind, must reap the whirl-

The question therefore resolves itself into this critical point: “What will
Christendom do even now?”
