THE ARMIENIAN MASSACRISS AND VHIE
TREATY OF BERLIN, nt

Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Jnropge; re famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the s@emi@e famous Treaty
of Bertin, the ypartyr roll of the unfortunate Armenia® nation stands without
its parallel ff ppry.

In thd Guiball at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed inSthtt city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the prond array of representatives of the powertul Governments of [curope,
but in the toterests of Humanity there shonld be attached to that painung
the wordiny of Article Gt of the Treaty of Beriin written in letters of blood
(Armenjan blogd).

Tre was a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of “thy
terrible stronghold of Kars,” universally admitted to be one of the vreftfst
aud most difficult military exploits ever achieved, and the crowning sudgess
of the Russian arms in Astatic Purkey, should have been accemphshed by
an Armenian General; that although Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquistawnluaunrsicre Kua sonjucred and
dg! yet by these successes not only was no amclioration attained of the

Ard iate of their unhappy nation under Turkish rife, but that fate, hard
efore, was made a huudredfold and even a thousandfold harder.
