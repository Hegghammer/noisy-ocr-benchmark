O PREFACE, |
——
Tue subject which we have here treated is a sort of figurative |
battle-field, where fierce contests have for ages been from time to time |
waged ane, notwithstanding the determined assaults of the attacking
hosts, the contention and its cause remain pretty much as they were at the ((-
| commencement of the ware We in the matter remain strictly neutral, V!
| merely performing the part of the public’s “own correspondent,” making
| it our daty to gather togopbarsuch ausshomnosprchyss both ancient
and modern, as may prove interesting or important, to take note of the
vicissitudes of war, mark its various phases, and, in fine, to do our best |
to lay clearly before ourereaders the historical facts—experienees and
arguments-—relating to the much-discussed “ Corset question.”
As most of our readers are aware, the leading journals espegialhy
intended for the perusal of Jadics have been for many years Vp cx
| for the exchange of a vast number of letters apdepapers touching
the use ofthe Corset. The questions mining 4) the history of
this apparently indispensable article of ladies? attire, its construction,
| application, and influence on the figure have become so numerons of Jate
| that we have thought, by embodying all tix weed titan and gamer
relating ° FS their wearers, and the yarious costumes worn by
| jadies at défore periods, arranging the subject-matter in its due order |
as to dates, and at the same time availing ourselves of careful illustration |
when needed, that an intercsting yolume would result.
