On the field the ever victorious army of little Japan undermised Russia’s
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
defeated and ever retreating army of colossal Russia. At sea the Ko
victorious Japanese leet succeeded in completely annihilating RTissian
Vleet. It was war such as the world had never yQtgeoyt The secret of
such astounding successes should be investigated, af here I bee leave to
quote from of a series of articles in which | gave view to my opinions
during Rue War.“ fapan may he likened to the bundle of
faggots in Ye PAle firmly tied together ; one faycot of larger dimensions tn
the centre, the sovereign round whom the whole nation clusters, and all,
ruler and people tied together by adamantine bands of patriotism.”

These remarks of mine were based on observations of actual facts. In
national unity Japan stands as an object lesson to the world; she furnishes
an cxamplendneithe world necds to copy, and which a nation so politically
forlorn as ourselves more than any other needs to copy.

From the astounding suecess of Japan let us torn to the rsiishhe
Great Republic of the United States of America occupies in the world, ‘and
take the lesson to heart of what Union can accomplish as we contrast their
present position with the position that the handful of puritan pilgrims occupted ;
when they first landed Of et Tea ber HON cc years ago.

National Unity ts onr greatest need; it is the banner which we must
raise ub over our national life. National Unity must be engraven on the
tablets of our minds _and throb in the pulses of our hearts. There are
mountains of diticiliies betore us, and if ever we must reach the goal we
can only do so by being bound together like the bundle of faggots in the
fable, with no weakening or loosening of the bands. Then/perlaps we
might once more be able to get an independent footing on rae j
of our fathers, and perhaps once more rally round our own flag Cf S /
ese_hives for the State, not for himself; we a Calle for which to Giza, -
but let us liweTor our communities whilst we kedp thA hope in our hearts
that communities Grow into States.

We have grit and endurance in an unparalleled degree, but thes
characteristics will profit us nothing if waaencantiaencunity.

Let us rem T that utterance of the Founder of our fatth. In \a
loyalty and a}éfiiance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents of
cataract, bu#wesafist remember lis warning utterance :—

“What shall it profita man.” What shall it profit a nation. Unity is
the soul of a nation. Let us keep our seul and not lose it.
