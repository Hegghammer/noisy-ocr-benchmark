REED AND SPLINT WEAVING 59

tion of air. Ef colors have been mixed properly and thinned to the
right consistency, the reed will dry rapidly and the color will be
sharp and clear, free from muddy effects.

| A woven article such as a basket or woven top footstoo] may be
dipped, or the calor poured over and allowed to drip dry. In some
instances it is good policy to wipe surplus stain ofitghthn“bhen-
in the case of the footstool or similar project, if the worker sa

stools shown herewith are left natural. Reed may be shellacked or
varnished. Because of its porositeat sais very casily unless some
finishing agent is used, and a good grade of elastic varnish is recom-
mended as a finish, especially when the woven article is subject to
severe use.

Other Materials,—Reed is not the only good medium acapred
in weaving, either in correlation with wooed or when used alone.
On the stools Hustrated several other materials have been used,

. as inner hickary bark ond Indian splints and fiber. Binding cane,
rope, and even willow may be utilized wich success. Paper fiber
was discussed in detail in Chapter V and needs no elaboration.
Fig. 60 shows a stool partly weven with this serviceable material.
Sufficient te say that this fiber adapts itself admirably to almost
all work where reed is commonly employed, and in many instances_~_,_,~_
is, commercially, supplanting reed.

the sap is up and the bark slips easily, a hickory tree may be cut”
down, and the rough outer bark shaved with a draw knife from
the top of the log the full length of the trunk, leaving a surface
from 8 in, to 10 in. wide. With a heavy knife split the inner bark
on either side of the shaved strip; then beginning at one end peel
