CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.
Tuar there has hitherto existed no good hook of Engravings of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the progress of the student in that department of Art, is to he regretted. The talents
of Mr. Jonny Scorr, brought into action by those of Grupry, Cooper, and the Retnacurs,
haye presented the public with excellent representations of the distinguished ornaments of the
turf: the sports of the field, and the habits and manners of the caning race, woe also duly
honoured: but of the ferocious Ticer tribe, and the lordly Lroy, Teer extan that
would bear critical inspection, beyond a few detached, phiyw nothing like a collection of
figures, whose justness and accuracy of fir ion, character, and expression, might be
relied o .
Des any Preader imagine that the various Etchings which have been performed—chiefly
abroad Nyy Mists of no mean ability, may be considered as exeeptions? They are not exceptions :
or at best, the number which might be so regarded is but small, and those, for the most part, of
dimensions not accommodated to the drawer of the cabinet, or the shelf of the library.
rn Drrnwenabobjectionable on this ground alone. Speaking of them in the ageregate, the
heavier charge lies against them of being’ insuflicient to those purppse/of taste and information

form, character, and oxpession, {han Is cencral y supposed or than will be easily believed, by
those who have not actually compared them with the Lions, Leopards, and Tigers of Nature.
They have been taken too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
Nor is this intendedtoiapugn the merits, az historical or poctical painters, of those distinguished
Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth, It is possible, that ps a painter of allegory, Rubens
might consider that strong infusion of human form, charfctdr, ayd expression, by which his Lions,
for example, are distinguished, as necessary, or conduciye, tp hf aleforicglefirposes y or, it is pos-
—sible that his knowledge of this animal may CM roroughly Avell-gr. adh, and that he
may have fabonred under early prejudice of mihd, or Af vision, in this"part of his"eduecation as a
Painter, and may not have seen Lions as they really are. This is what thf writer is most inclined
to believe, (though not to insist) ; foveven, in treating the subject ofyDanfel in the den of Lions—
