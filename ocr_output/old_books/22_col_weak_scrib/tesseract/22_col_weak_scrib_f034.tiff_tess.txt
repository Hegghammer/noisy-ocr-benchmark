16 HALFHOURS WITH THE HIGH WAYMEN
entrusted to her keeping by a farmer attending
the market. To convince Ratsey how teste
a person she was, she foolishly showed where st
had placed-the bag ; and as soon as her back was
turned oo) taken it from the cupboard where
it lay, a ade olf.

When the farmer returned and wanted his
money, there was the very deuce to pay. He and
the landlady went off to the nearest justice and
sworg up, ifppustion against Gamalicl, who was
arrested and thrown into prison, but not before he
had found time to return home and bury the bag
in the garden. In confidence he told his mother

| where it was hid, his mother told his sister, his
sister told her husband, her husband told his
friends, and so at last the confession reached the
Lees of the justices. Gamaliel would undoubtedly
ave been hanged on that occasion, only he broke

prison and escaperty cfad only in his shirt.

His further adventures with Snell and
Shorthose, two companions of like inclination,

stilted language than that of the Life. Curiopsly ‘
eTough, ene of these incidents is concerns
the robbing of an actor, whom Ratsey bids d¢eH¥er
his money first, and a scene from Lamlet after-

apee with phe-best models that the unnamed
author ot fet life failed to put hfe into
his narrefive" The incident is treated im as dead
and wooden a manner as the rest.
