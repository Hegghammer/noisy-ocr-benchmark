Strutt informs us that the Roman women, married as well as
unmarried, used girdles, and besides them they sometimes wore a broad
swath ox bapdage round their breasts, called strophium, which seems to
have answered the purpose of the bodice or stays, and hada buckle or |

| bandage on the left shoulder, and that the mitra or girdle of the Greeks
| probably resembled the strophium of the Romans. The annexed
| lustration represents a lady of Ancient Greece. He also speaks of
the Muses as being described hy Hesiod as being girt with golden
“mitres,? and goes on to inform us that Theocritus in one of his
pastorals introduces a damsel complaining to a shepherd of his rudeness,
eying he had loosened her mitra or girdle, and tells her he means to
~ dedicate the same to-Womms. So it will be seen that the waist and its
adorument were considered at that early period of the world’s history
matters of no ordinary importance, and whether the term stropkjun),
/ zone, mitra, custula, stays, bodice, or corset is made use of, ta
sought to be obtained by their aid was the same.
—Constantmention is made by carly writers of (Dr as beg a /
very elegant garment, and there are notices of it ‘we‘far back as the
Trojan war, and the ladics of Troy appear to have generally worn it.
On the authority of Strutt, it may be stated to have been “a thin light
mantle worn by Grecian ladies above “Me tuiie;” and we read that
Antinous Vf to Penelope a beautiful large and variegated
