many voarskggs The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettercd by Jonathan G, Torton,.

The imscription surrannds the herder of the stone, and reads as
follows:

It is said thet this epitaph was written by hinself, and that it, to-
ecther with the inseription, date of his death excepted. was all put
upon the stone before he dient. Tle was the uly one gf the eruinal
thirteen who brepeht bis tombstone with him, and this fet seems to
indicate a compbhdable desire te see that his name and memory
should not pAiskfgom the earth.
