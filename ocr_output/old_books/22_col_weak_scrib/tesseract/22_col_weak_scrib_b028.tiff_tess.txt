6 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

and carnivorous habits. They walk on their toes: yet not so much from that habitual stealthiness
of pace, by which they advance unpereeived till within a spring of their prey ; as because it is also
the means of that celerity of motion which is necessary to the very existence of animals that can
fleed only on flesh.

Their claws are excecdingly powerful; and they are enabled to draw them up into sheaths
between their toes, so as to prevent their points from touching the ground ; whence they are
called retraetile ; and those claws are, in consequence, always kept sharp, unworn, and ready for
active service.

The eyes of the Feline tribe—of every face in nature a striking and important feature—vary
in the different species, and are capable of much alteration in the same animal ; as instinctive
impulse, or internal emotion, changes the expression of his counteuance; and also from the
degrees of light which act upon their pupils. Of Lions the pupils of the eyes are circular, and
not of a yellow colour, as has heen stated in the most diffuse modern dissertations on the
Carnivora, but black. It is the iris of the Lion’s eye Cae They appear to be best

he Tiger, on the contrary, wilgéek his prey by day as well as by night ; and during twilight the
cour of his eyes is that of a blue-green flame. Ifa stranger passes near a Tiger in a menagerie,

e colour of the animal's eyes will sometimes alter suddenly, from yellow-green to blue-green ;
not from auy alteration in the degree of light acting upon them, but from mental excitement, and
from a certain natural facility of expansion and contraction of the eye-pupils.

Hicnce a characteristic difference betwee u the Lion and the Tiger. The habits of the latter
are diurnal, and he disregards night-fires : the Lion, on the omtrary, whose eyes are not calculated
for the glare of day, cannot bear to encounter rl a Yet these physical conforma-
tious are sometimes overcome by the rage of hunger; nd hence, in Mr. Epwiy Lanpstxr’s
contending group, the Lion is represented as attacking the Tiger although it be day.

which the reader will perceive how limited are their powers of expression of countenance, when
compared with those of human nature, notwithstanding their superiority over all other quadrupeds.
