is necessary before the weaver feels confident of readily caning any
area of odd shape.

In weaving the diagonals it is frequently necessary to run several

in one hole in order to keep the canes as straight as possible. Just

holes skipped entirely.

It may be done in many cases where it will not be subject to harf77-"~
wear. It is neat in appegrance and is much simpler than seven-
step caning. The preapon should not be made that this weave
will jn any way suppl ahi regular weave, but in instances where

will prove sufficient and effective.

Fig. 12 illustrates a frame caned with the five steps. The dis-
tance between holes was purposely made greater than usual, to
show the weave clearly. The first strands are strung in, in the
same mariner as described in the seven steps. The second series of
