erally allowed to go out after dinner and amuse them-
selves, but it was a wet day and Aline was looking
diseonsolately out of the window wondering whether
she should go into the library or what she should do,
when the angry dame thought that the child offered
an objeck for the farther exercise of her power. ‘Why
are you idling there?’’ she said. ‘‘They are all short-
handed to-day, go you and scour out the sink and then
take out the pig-bucket and be quick about it.’’

| Aline gave a little gasp of surprise, but ran off at
once, The buttery door was open and she saw Thomas
drinking and offering a tankard ‘to one of the other “~~
érvanis, and she heard him laugh loudly as he pointed

<a row of goblets, four of them clean and the rest of
them dirty, while he said,—-‘‘ Edward cleaned those, and

I am waiting here as Tong as it would take to clean
them.’’ He caught sight of her and scowled, but she
passed on. :

Aline had soon finished the sink and ran quickly
with the pig-bucket, after which she returned to the

Mowbray to inspect.

became suspicio By the way, Thomas, there are
a dozen of Chagas, bring me the others,’’

‘Yes, Mistress,’’ said Thomas, triumphantly, ‘“‘but
they were all dirty and I have just cleaned these.’’

Mistress Mowbray saw that she could not catch him
