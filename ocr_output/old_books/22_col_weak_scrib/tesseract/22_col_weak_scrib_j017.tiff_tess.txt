CANING; THE SEVEN STEPS 18

open squares are thus formed over the area being caned. Unless
the cane is soaked it will prove rather difficult to pair the canes.

the canes either run over or under the pairs.

Step 0. Vhis step is identical with the preceding one. ‘The canes* 7 -7~
are at right angles to thy first diagonals. In this step and the
preceding one note hay fo wan run intu the corner holes.
This holds true in alWWredetagular frames where a corner hole is
bored. It permits the strands to run in as straight a line as pos-
sible. Tf it is necessary to turn abruptly to enter a hole it is obvious
that an error has been made by the weaver.

Step 7. Pulla cane of the same size as used in the other sreps up
thru a hole, over the binder cane and down thru the same hole.
A loop is thus formed and the binder secured. Pull taut, then
