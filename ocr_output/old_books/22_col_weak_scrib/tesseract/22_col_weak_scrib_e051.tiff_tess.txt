| “Their kirtles were of rede cendel,* {
J laced smalle, jollyf, and well} |
| O There might none gayer go.’’
| In the French version of the same poem it ts, we read, more fully ‘

The Lady Trianore is thus described :-—
EVO}: lady was in a perple pall, * |
With pertill bodye and middle small.” 1
Wharton quotes from an ancient poem, which he believes to date as
far back as 1200, in which a lover, speaking of the object of hus
admiration, thus throws down the gauntlet of challenge, and exclaims-—
« Middle her she hath mensk small.”
The word meusk or maint being used instead of very or much. Some
diferences of opinion have existed among writers as to the origin of the
word corset. Some are of opinion that the French words corps, the
| body, and serrer (to tightly inclose or incase), led to the adoption of
| the term. Madame La Sante gives it as her opinion, however, that ft i
| more probably a corruption of the single word corps, which was fbrpody
| written cers, and may be taken as a diminutive for it. Another !
view of théTMatter has been that the name of a COosc called
corse, Which was at one time extensively used in the manufacture of
corsets, nay have been thus corrupted. This is scarcely prebable, as
