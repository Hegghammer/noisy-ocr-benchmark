Added to these importaat factors of racial charactenstics, tnfluences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in ‘Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Eqyeste
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this super-eadded evil gi ae
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, gscatcr epartiders and
depredators than the Purks, the regular occupation ficKe lives comprises
murder and sgbbery, and who have through weary ¢@entaries unremittngly
quartered oe upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits df thetJlabour and toil. Indeed as the Hamidich cavalry which
was establiMve® expressly for the [Tomidian massacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized murder, can now find for those habits in
which they were encouraved and trained to indulge by the Hamtdian
régune,

Under all such conditions no hope of better days can be forthcoming
no prospect of better times seems possible, for that unhappy portion Ue
Armenian race whom jorce of circumstances keeps on the soil o\fthe

| fatherland.

‘Phe appoiatment of Christian governors over the provinces in-
habited by them nicht anelonwasacHbhbnalrechemer alternative,

allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespective of creed or
ationality, would furnish some means of selédefence against the raids

Paes of the oppressors; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christianpeasaet subject to Vurkish rule, and living in the midst
of his enesies, must remain one long strugele and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Notthejnost fertile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the nsf afsiduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abidiny instincts, Ho t
Armenian peasant under Purkish rule even a mpedtcum of tht tom /
happiscss, aad security of life and property, uf law of all civiteett -
