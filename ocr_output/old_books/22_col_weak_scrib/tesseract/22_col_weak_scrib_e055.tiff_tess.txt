THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE. 49
having only her kirdle upon her back. John cop eancet
wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus dese bé@s’P company of
ladies. They were, says he, “clothed all alike, in kirtles with rich capes
or mantlf4spfyti-colourcd, white, and blue, embroidered all over with
various devicgh” Their bodies are described as being long and small,
and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though each of them |
| had been a queen. We tind that the tight-laced young Jadies of the
j court of the Lady Triamore “had mantles of green-coloured velvet, | .
handsomely bordered with gold, and Jined with rich furs, Their heads |
| were neatly MOT In kerchiefs, and were ornamented with cut work and
richly-striped wires of gold, and upon their kerchiefs they had each of (/
| them a pretty coronal, embellished with sixty gems or more ;” and of |
| | their pretty mistress it is said in the same pocm, that her cheeks were as
; red as the rose when it first blossoms. Ler hair shone upon her head
| __ like golden wire, falling BOC WHONN OR ROI chy ommamented with
precious stones, Her vesture was purple, and her mantle, lined with white
rmine, was also clegantly furred with the same. he Princess Blanche,
the daughter of Eidbvart-lll., the subject of the anvexcd illustration,
appears to have copied closely the dress above described, and, like the
maids of honour of the Lady Triamore herself, she is not only wichly
habited but thoroughly well-laced as well. Thus we see, in (Lp:
1361, the full influence of the corset on the costume of thit ida.
‘Lhere is another pocm, said to be more sn even Launfal, ;
which, no doubt, served to give a tone and directh © the fashicns of
times following after. Ilere we find a beautiful lady described as
wearing a splendid girdle of beatén gold, embellished with rubies and
emeralds, about her middle small. a
ae describing a lover who is in the act of admiring
his mistres% thus writes: |
“He seeth hir shape forthwith, all |
| Hir bodye round, hir middle small.”
