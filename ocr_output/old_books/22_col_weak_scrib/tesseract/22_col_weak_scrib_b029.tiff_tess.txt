CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. z
au opposite theory, in which instinctive agency is rejected, and the appearances are explained from
a consideration of the necessities and voluntary exertions of the animal. With regard to the
observer, it has been asserted, that it is hy experience alone that he distinguishes the signs of the
passions ; that we learn, while infants, to consider smiles as expressions of kindness, hecause they
are accompanied by acts of beneficence and by endearments; and frowns as the contrary, because
we find them followed by blows ; that the expression of anger in a brute, is only that which has
been observed to precede his biting ; and that of foudness, his fawning and licking of the hand.
With regard to the creature itself, it is said, what has been called the external signs of passion, are
merely the concomitants of those voluntary movements, which the passions or habits suggest ; that

' the glare of the Lion’s eye, for example, is the consequence of a voluntary exertion to sce his prey
more elearly —his grin, or snarl, the natural motion of uncasing his fangs before he uses them.
This, however, is not quite true of all animals and of all expression of passion.”

“Attending merely to the evidence furnished by anatomical investigation, hat I shall
venture to affirm is this: that a remarkable difference is to be fouy cet Ponto and
range of expression, in man and in animals: that in the fu here seems to be a systematic
provision for that mode of communication and| a@ural language, which is to be read in the

appropfiate sigys ; and that there are even muscles in the human face to which uo other use can be
assig nec to serve as the organs of this language: that, on the other haud, there is in the lower
animals no range of expression which is not fairly referable as a mere accessary to the voluntary
or needful actions of the animal; and that this accessary expression does not appear to be in any

“There appears to me (continues Mr. BELL) to be no expressiof if the face of any animal
lower in the scale of being than quadrupeds; and in them the \frongest and most marked
expression is that of rage; the object of which is opposition, resistance, aud defence. But on
