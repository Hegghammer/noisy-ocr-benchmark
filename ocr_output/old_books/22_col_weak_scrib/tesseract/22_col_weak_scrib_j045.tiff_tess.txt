Rush seating, employing either penuine rush oz substitutes may.
be done to good advantage and with excellent results in manual

introduction in manual trainig shops. Ruslr seating employs a very
simple weave. Different materials empleyed in weaving naturally
require different degrees of skill, and the difficulries encountered
are those resulting from handling materiz!s and not because of the

The use of rush in England dates no earlier than 1720. Several
types of chairs were made there between that date and 1870. In

Normandy and Brittany about 1750. Flanders produced rush
