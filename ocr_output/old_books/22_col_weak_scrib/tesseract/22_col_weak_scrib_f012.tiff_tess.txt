vill PREFACE
from Snith, who himself was prone lo trelude 7
* the most evtraraugunt myths in his puges, aan
his folio A GENERAL AND ‘TRUE Itistory OF
THE Lifyeswyp Acrions or rite Mosr Famous
Uicuwhyyts. Both of them inelude pirates und
murderers. Of the “truth” af mach in Smith
unt Johnson, the less said the better.
No one has ever reprinted those uuthors in
thom—ertgunttriranagance, or their grossness.
Mi would be impossible ; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor haus any one ever edited
| them, or even written un independent history of
the highwaymen. Whenrwe consider how wstonish:
ingly popular those remanees hace ever been
¢ / which have had Cleude Du Vall, and Purpin,
und their like for heroes, this is not « little
SUPpPISing.
Perhaps the tusk kas been ubendoned because
of the diffieully—the almost insuperable difficulty (])
—of sifting fuct from fiction, und becuuse pe u ‘
Chitling ~sense that it would be u rurnttog ih
to present the highwayman as he really was: «
Jellow rarely heroic, yenerully foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No HOrttret—reortd
be eo ia the frunk historian for this dis-
serzice ; Aint do nol think the historian who euime
to the subject in this cold scientific spiril of «a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
