There is nothing neater in all the history of
highwaymen than this ancedote, twinkling brightly
amid the matter-of-fact records of a degencrate
day.
There is plentiful evidence that when Captain
Alexandor Smith in 1719-20 wrote and published
his work upon the highwaymen and other ovil-
doers, he based his book upon the many chap-
books and broadsides then in existence. Many
of them may even now be found by those who
do not mind scarching for them, but whether
they will repay the trouble is quite another
matter. He includes In his gallery even Rohm
Hood and Sir John Falstaft and, not concerned
to point out their legendary or merely literary
character, gives exact (though necessarily not
a truthful) biography of each.
Several aditions of Smith exist; some in three,
others in two volumes. The title-pages vary
N.
largely, but all are extremely lengtby, and SO
(
curious that it is well worth while to
one as on the next page.
Captain Alexander Smith took an immense
delight in his villains. You cannot fail to per-
ceive, if you read his book, that his only contempt
was for a in the art. Royalist to the
heart's core of him, he expends his most loving
labours upon the freebooters who displayed his
own political bias, and there can be little doubt
VOL. I.
