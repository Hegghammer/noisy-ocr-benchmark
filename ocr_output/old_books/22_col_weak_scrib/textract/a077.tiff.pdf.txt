I will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and relate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
1796 after ruling over Armenia filty eight years.
He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his dominies and

Armenia or Amenians being no doubt later corruptions.
The urst victory of Aram was over Neuchar king of Media, whom he
took prisone and pat to death, and made a large part of the country of the
defeated prince tributary to his own. The second victory of Aram was over
Barsham king of Babylon, whom also be took prisoner and put to death.
The next victory was over the king of Cappadocia the anny of the

or assert, but in taking up link by link of whatever knowledge has been left
to us, there seems to be grounds for supposing that the dramicans

conquests and their kingdom into Mesopotamia stid even to the shores of

Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when he includus
Northern Mesgnotania, together with the nominamous country of Arrias,
