L AVENIR.
In the foregoing pages I have directed humble efforts 10 sketch out
what Europe have done in the past, and how their actions
have rellected on my unfortunate race.
It is considered good policy now by a certain class of European Vira writers
to ascribe all the horrors of the Armenian Massacres to Hamid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as unassailable and unconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as a sort of superhuman being who swept overything
before him to the consummation of his own despotic will.
The
reason
for
this is not difficult to perceive They would fain disavow the part Europe
has played in the tragedy. and to do this successfully it becomes necessary
also to present Turkey to the world now as a paradise (from whence the
tyrant once remoredi) peopled only by saints and angels SO we have also
many roseate colored word pictures of Constitutional Turkey.
The murders, deportations and imprisonments of the Wikish revolu-
tionaries, or more correctly reformers, were undoubtedly mossic work
Abdul Hamid and his palace clique, but Abdul and his count not
have carried out that hellish work of wholy extermination
me
Armenians without the perpetration and ricibation of the Turkish
people. It is trec the massacres were originated and organized in the
Palace, the Palace clique stirred up religious fanaticism and race hatred, Aut
the co-operation of the people was mann the people co-orerated
in order to plander and enrich themselves with the worldly goods thant
Armenians andays knew how to acquire by their own industry and totl the
appeal to and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
