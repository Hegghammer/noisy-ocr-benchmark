THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
pents twasting together. The end of the staff
lifted itself as though the serpents were rising
up. The dwarf covered his eyes, and cried out,
"O Magus!"
"Remind me of the second dream that was
considered remarkable," said the King. And the
dwarf said, "The second dream was the Dream of
the Laden Ass."
"Itisevenso," said the King. "I Idreamed that
I looked down the Waynofthenionsihaditheror
came along the way a laden ass. Of that dream
also those skilled in the signification of dreams
could tell me nothing."
"And yet the dream is plain," said the En-
chanter, looking full into the eyes of the King.
"A laden ass signifies a treasure found - your
dream is of a treasure being brought into your
palace." -
O
"It is so,' said the ancient dwarf with the crown
of scarlet feathers upon his head. "In dreams an
ass is always laden with treasure."
"And whut was my third dream?' said the
King.
