orgy, except to call them fiends incarnate : and who is the bold man who
can guarantee that these same fiends incarnate have
and changed all of a sudden ; or that the handful of liberal Turks at Lon
stantinople are capable of controlling and restraining them. We lait ing
even heard that the leaders and participators of the last transacres have
been punished as they deserved ; and what is the form they are left un-
punished ? becanse the Government is afraid to punish Mahommedans for
killing Christing because the liberal Turks dare not punish the " true
believers for Killing " Kaftirs.'
The religion of Mahommed, the religion of the sword, has been infesed
into the Turk, and to understand the effect of the religion of Mahommed
upon the Turk, it is necessary to regard it from four aspects, or from four
points of analysis. First, the fundamental doctrine and law of the religion.
Second the character of the founder as an example to his followers. Third,
the racial and ethinographic characteristics of the Turk. Fourth, the effect
which this particular religion would be likely to have on this particular race.
When we have viewed the Turk and his government from these four
of analysis, we have the explanation of all the woe and desolation which
have lain over the countries under Turkish rule.

between the two races, the oppressor and the oppressed. Thousands upon
thousands of Armenian women, thousands upon thousands of Armenian
children, have been hounded to death, or savagely, ferociously, horribly and
loathsomely maltreated by the Turk, and yet in all the agonizing when
Massacre has succeeded upon Massacre, has there been C285
one single instance of a Turkish weman or child maltreated by trachians
The last massacres though especially orgam from the Pala
B.
Constantinopte, were officially announced to priginate from an affray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed one of the three
given equal numbers and arms, the mmnum Armenian is always a match for the
Turk, but alas for him that unequal numbers and want of arms have always
made him the coum of his oppressor.
Ahmed Bey in the first part (Ses Causes) of his book La Crise (Te
l'Orient published in Paris in 1007 holds a brief for his nation which
through its own fallacious arguments falls to the ground. I will quote one
passage as an example.
