smell of corpses is in the air, the odor from the carcases of the "christian
swine" reek in the nostrils of the Turk, he turns away, his jaws dripping with
blood, and rests to couch for a future spring. We have seen that sort of an
end to the tragedy of a tiger's victim : the tiger has eaten his fill, hat Jung
to keep guard over the crunched bones and mangled bits of bloogle fresh that
bestrew the carth. So also now there is a residue O& & those that have
served as the meat and wine of this devil's feast; wie demons have gorged
themsclves, over the banquet, and now there are left over the broken remains
of the banquet, the miserable residue homeless and destitute.
Civilved nations have received a temporary moral shock, like a shock
that spreads from the centre of an explosion ; the electric vibration running
far and wide from the scene of the centre of devastation. There are among
these civilized nations generous and kind hearted people who open their
purse strings ; they give money to purchase shelter, food and clothing for
these
ed and. hungry beggars, made homeless, naked and
hungry through no fault of their own. But oh! ye generous and kind hex
ed people can any power under heaven assuage the heart anguish of this
miserable residue? Can they be made by any means of human comftrt to
forget the black horrors or recover from the effects of the fires of the hideous
aftliction through which they have passed? What is there left for a woman
who has seen with with her own ears
me dying cry of her murdered child ? even her reason must give way under
the stress of her anguish. All ye who are mothers, I appeal to you, for one
moment to put yourselves in the place of thousands of such mothers, in
whose hearts the other's love burns as in yours, and then measure
the depth of their agony.
Generous and kind hearted people who open your purse would
to God I entreat, ye would raise up your voices and demand that this bidcous
slaughter and oppression of a helpless christian race should clasel ourd
That
to God I entreat, ye would raise up your voices and temand that this ! (cople
of an industrious, intelligent christian race, robus in

should
be let to live. Would to God I entreat, that ye would raise up your voices
and demand for them that security of life and property to which they are
entitled just as equally as all other peoples.
