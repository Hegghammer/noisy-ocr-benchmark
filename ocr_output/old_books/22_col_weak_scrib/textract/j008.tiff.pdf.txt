expected of and. in a measure, the first two years

Practically the entire emphasis is laid upon weaving as applied
to some form of seat. either as a decorative feature or as a necessary
part of the structure. these materials may be utilized in various
|

of which are suggested. Experience with them will lead the Worker
to new and interesting fields of a distinctly educational nature.
