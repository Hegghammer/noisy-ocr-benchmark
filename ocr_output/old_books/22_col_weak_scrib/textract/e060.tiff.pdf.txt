THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.
often very richly ornamented with furs and costly needlework As
wating
fashion changed, dresses were made with open fron to be worn
over the surcoat without altogether concealing it. A portrait of Marie
d' Anjou of France, shows this arrangement of costume. The waist
appeas very tightly laced, and the body of the surcoat much resembles the
modern bodice, but is made by stiffening and cut to perform the part of
a very strong and efficient corset. Until the termination of the fourtecnth

visible, are crimson velvet, and reach to the centre of the hand

In both France and
Germany a great many strange freaks of fashion appear to have been
practised about this time. The tight, harlequin-like dress was adopted
by the gentlemen, whilst the long trams surred the ire of royalty
We find Mort of Saxony issuing the following laws : " No wives or
daughtos of knights are to wear dresses exceeding one yard and a-half
