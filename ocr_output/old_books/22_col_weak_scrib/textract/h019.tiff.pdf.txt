MORE \BOUT THE (11.1) HOUSE.
It will be seen by the engraving that the old house is double. The
western part is that which was built by Barnabas in 1650-60. The

mmm by Tonathan 1., about 1682. The apper
coom of this part was used for a court house for nearly twenty years,
as we learn from Thompson's History of Long Island, and some of
the old benches used when it was a court-house are still preserved.
The old "castle, as Jonathan Gr. Horton. its last Horion occupant,
used to call it, is in all probability the oldest wood house in America.
I know of no dwelling hoose of anykind stone or brict now sund
ing that can date back as far as this venerable old mansion. There
were few huts on the east of Long Island previous to 16.10-two or
is said on Shelter Island. Bmt these, as well as those built by
the Paritans, immodiately on their seitlement in Southold, soon all
passed away. Not a vestige of any of the first generation baildings

rarely find three. But here we have six Cenerations in succession, all
bearing the Horton name, living and dying in the same house, and
all born in it except Barnabas I., and his son Jonathan. We may go
to the castles and palaces of the old world, and search long and
gently, and fail to find paralle) case.
With a few repair the old castle may yet stand for generations far
in the future.
It requires some thought and reflection to realize the lapse of time
since the old house was built. Sec the old Puritan himself there
twenty years; then his son Jonathan, twenty-eight years and then
Jonathan, Jr., about sivty years; and next Lawrence and his son Jona-
