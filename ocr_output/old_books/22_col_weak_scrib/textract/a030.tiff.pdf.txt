The efforts of the Armenians, and the entreaties of their Patriarch
Nerses had procured the insertion of Article 16 in the Treaty of San
Stefano signed between Russia and Turkey in March ISTS. In that
wording of the Article had been suggested by the Patriarch
leg
provided the following stipulation for the protection of thee :--
"
As the evacuation by the Russian troops the territory which they
now OCCUDE TO Armenia, and which is to be restored to Turkey, might give
rise to canifics and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good
relation between the two countries, the Sublime Porte engages to carry into
effect without further delay the improvements and reforms demanded by
local requirements in the provinces inhabited by the Armentans, and to
guarantee their security against the Kurds and Circassians."
What followed has passed into history. The British Government of

the Treaty of San Stefano. Thus the substantial guarantee of a natural and
immediate protection which
the Armenians then had in Russia, was taken away, and the security of im-
potent words given in its stead, namely :-
The Sublime Porte undertakes to carry ont without further delay the
improvements and forms demanded by local requirements in the provinces
inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the
Circassians and Kurds. It will periodically make known the steps taken to
this effect to the Powers, who will superintend their application.

could furnish food for laughter were it not for he terrible tragedy involved
in it.
The insertion of Article 61 in the Treaty of Berlin, granted, or rather
scemingly granted, by the six l'owers of Europe, proved in reality, ns sub-
sequent events bore out, an instrument of death and torture. It uns
if
the reversal the figures had reversed the possibilities of succot and
protection and with the death of the Czar Liberator, the last chance of the
Armenians died.
The Turkish Massacres of 1875 and 1876 which led up to the Russo-
Turkish War of 1877 are historical facts too well known to need further
