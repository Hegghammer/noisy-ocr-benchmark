Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenta another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish
fortunately for themselves have been exempt this super-added the
collating
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, wranders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation knose lives comprises
marder and robbery, and who have through weary Centuries unremittingly
quartered mussives upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits their labour and toil. Indeed as the Hamidieh cavalry which
was establishe expressly for the Hamidian massacres was composed of
these Kards, it ought to be matter of speculation what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized murder, can now find for those habits in
which they were encouraged and trained to indulge by the Hamidian
régime.

Under all such conditions no hope of better days can be forthcoming
no prospect of better times seems possible, for that unhappy portion of the
Armenian race whom force of circumstances keeps on the soil O the
fatherland.
The appointment of Christian governors over the provinces in-
habited by them might amdoncnachaaher alternative,
or allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespective of creed or
hationality, would furnish some means of self-defence against the raids
and barbarities of the oppressors ; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christian peasant subject to Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his ene mies, must remain one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Notthe most fertile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the nos assiduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, can pring to the
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of thit comport,
B1
happiness, and security of life and property, which/ law of all civilized
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer an d ther of the soil.
