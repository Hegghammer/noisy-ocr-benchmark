Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have clung to their christian faith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdonis such as no other christian peoale
have been called upon to endare.
The cathedral of Etchmiatzin built by Gregory S Class to-day ; it has
constantly been repaired and rebuili in some part other, until perhaps
little of the Ditianal building may be left, but it still claims to be the church
built by the 1 Atron saint of Armenia. I shall here quote a passage from
"
Historical of the Armenian Chorch," written by an Armenian
priest :
" Owing to political circumstances the Armenian l'atriarchate had at
times to be transferred to metropolises and to other principal towns of
Armenia In the year A.D. 152 it was removed to Dwin, in 993 to Ani.
in 1114 to Romklah, and in 1294 to Sis. The Kingdom of Cilicia becoming
extinct, and, we having no more a kingdom and no longer a capital towng it
was natural and proper to re-transfer the Sec to its own original place as
the entire nation unanimously desired it. Accordingly, in the year 1411, it
was decided by an ecclesiastical meeting that the seat of the Catholicus should
return to Holy Etchmiatzin, where to this day has been preserved the
proper unbroken succession from our Apostles and from our holy Father,
Z
St. Gregory the Illuminator.
I read the other day in one of the foreign papers published in Japan,
the following piece
" An Armenian Church pronounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christian era, has been discovered in a fair state f preserva-
tion in the neighbourhood of Bash-Aparnah.'
Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor abri is now
UBI
conducting might lead to throwing more light on history.
