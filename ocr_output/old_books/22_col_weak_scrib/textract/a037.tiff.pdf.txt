No one doubts that a great forward movement is reaching its culminat-
ing point in the destiny of Asia. The West has learnt its all of religion (the
moral and guiding principle of mankind) from the East, and now the East
would fain learn the law of restraint and the law of freedom (the profein ing
principles of mankind) from the West. Inspired by this feelinic me liberal
Turks decidedly mean well, and they are animated Sia sincere desire
to
ensure peace and security of life and property for the Neterogeneous peoples
under the Tapich sway, but they themselves have had to contend and still
have to contend with a fanatical populace.
To the Manommedan world at large the Caliph of Islam is the envor of
God, the sacredness of whose person must Le inviolate. Abdul Hamid, the
astute politician, knew that the security of his sovercignty depended on his
Caliphal rights, and his main policy during the long period of his execrable
reign had been directed towards preserving and asserting the same; thus
we can sec how lis dethronement, which the liberal Turks would gladly have
accomplished simultaneously with the inauguration of the Constitution,
to be deferred to a later period, and how it was necessary for the Shel ul
Islam to pronounce the Caliph a traitor to his sacred trust, a violator of the
holy law of the Prophet. before his dethronement could be dared or
accomplished.
