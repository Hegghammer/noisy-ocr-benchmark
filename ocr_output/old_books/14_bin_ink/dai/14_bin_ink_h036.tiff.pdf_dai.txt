money, of which he had enough to pay down for the farm, but Stroud

then settled, for a time, in Middlesmithfield, Pa., but about 1789,
he came to Sheshequin, Bradford Co., Pa., and took up land where
Edward Brigham now resides, and here he spent the balance of his
days. He and his wife were members of the Baptist Church. He
died 14 August, 1821. She died 11 March, 1825. They were both
buried in Horn Brook Cemy.
