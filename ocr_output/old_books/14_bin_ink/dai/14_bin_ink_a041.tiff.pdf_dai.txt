like a round bow, a great brown eye revealed the inward spirit's intelligence and zeal un-
quenched. On his head was a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.
Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest men-Mgrditch
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people—slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or "The Only-Begotten
is Descended." From the window of a neighboring room, he might have looked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were not all cut close and buried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling ow and hurricane that hid the
cone of Ararat. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of that lake, eighty-seven years ago, Khrimian born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land; the Sultan counted as one of the formid-
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byro out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the ous champion of freedom-a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives thre the Near East. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos nov back, but not unhappy, for
from first to it had been inspired by one absorbing
fish aim-the freedom and
regeneration of his
is true he had failed.
From his earliest »
itnessed the
Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round
of nationality-such a
spirit as only kindles in oppre
g tolerance among the
prosperous and contented of the w
wandering far and wide through
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sec
Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poem
ories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wife's a
self to the building of schools,
which he generously threw open to Kurds, the he
of Armenians. For many
years, while Europe was occupied with Crimean wan,
, or French and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying from Van
ople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually
is schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emblems of the Host hun kery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenian patriarch of Constantinople
e was driven from
his office after four years.
But the cup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiless slaughter Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. With uried motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to plead his people's cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Europe
beforehand, urging them to create an autonomous neutral state for Armenia, as they had
done with success for the Lebanon. In London he became acquainted with Gladstone; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and,
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey's definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London amid shouts of "Peace with Honor,"
and Armenia was left to stew.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake
