having only her kirtle upon her back. John Gower, however, who
wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus describes a company ´of
ladies. They were, says he, "clothed all alike, in kirtles with rich capes
or mantles, parti-coloured, white, and blue, embroidered all over with
various devices." Their bodies are described as being long and small,
and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though each of the
had been a queen. We find that the tight-laced young ladies of me
court of the Lady Triamore "had mantles of green-coloured v et,
handsomely bordered with gold, and lined with rich furs. The eads
were neatly attired in kerchiefs, and were ornamented with cut
richly-striped wires of gold, and upon their kerchiefs they Each of

maids of honour of the Lady Triamore herself, is not on richly
habited but thoroughly well-laced as well. Thus we see, in me year
1361, the full influence of the corset on the costume of that period.
There is another poem, said to be more ancient than even Lunfal,
which, no doubt, served to give a tone and direction to the fashicris of
times following after. Here we find a beautiful lady described as
wearing a splendid girdle of beaten gold, embellished with rubies and
emeralds, about her middle small.
Gower, too, when describing a lover who is in the act of admiring
his mistress, thus writes:-
"He seeth hir shape forthwith, all
Hir bodye round, hir middle small.”
