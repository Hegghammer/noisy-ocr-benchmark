PROLOGUE
THE HORSES OF KING MANUS
As for the youth who had tried to steal the white
horse that the King owned, he was bound hand
and foot and taken into the castle of the King,
There he was thrown down beside the trestles of
the great table, and the hot wax from the candles
that lighted the supper board dripped down on
him. And it was told to
w's
sunrise
Then the
the
story that was
eigh of
the white horse was
ble. The
story could not be fine
m, however,
because the one who had bee ng it was now
outside, guarding the iron do of the stable with
a sword in his hand. And King Manus, sitting
at the supper board, cod not eat nor refresh
himself because there w no one at hand to finish
the story for him.
