utilized on the two parallel rails, except those on the corners.
Thruout the seven operations it is necessary that the cane be ke"
from twisting by drawing the remaining part of the strand th

Step 2. The second step is identical with the first, with the dif-
ference that the other two parallel rails are used, and that the
canes run over the first set of parallel
canes. If the first strand of cane ha

the second step.
Step 3. This step is a repetition of the first two. The canes o
this series run over the first and second series and parallel with the
first. As each strand is used up bind the end by pulling it under
a cane, crossing from one hole to another underneath the frame
and cutting off ab in, from the cane. Fig. 5 shows how this
