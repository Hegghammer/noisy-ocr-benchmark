HISTORICAL SKETCHES OF
Spanish the tradition relates to Spaniards,
and that the former is a Spanish designation of
the locality of the people to whom it relates.
The settlement of de Luna was the only Span-
ish ettlement with which the Indians could
have me in contact before Arriola's. That
settler therefore, must be the subject of the
Indian tion, and the Spanish name Pensa-
cola mus
been its name.
