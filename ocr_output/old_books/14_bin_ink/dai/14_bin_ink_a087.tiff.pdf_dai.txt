Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have clung to their christian faith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure.
The cathedral of Etchmiatzin built by Gregory still stands to-day ; it has

I read the other day in

"An Armenian Chu Pronounced by experts to date from the second

Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light on Armenian history.
