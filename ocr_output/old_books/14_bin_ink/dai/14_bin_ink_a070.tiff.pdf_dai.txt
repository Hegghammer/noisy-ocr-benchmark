It is considered good pol
certain class of European writers
to ascribe all the horrors of the
Massacres to Hamid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as
and unconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as a sort of

Armenians always knew how to acquire by their own industry and toil; the
appeal to their marauding and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
