PREFACE.

THE subject which we have here treated is a sort of figu
battle-field, where fierce contests have for ages been fr
waged; and, notwithstanding the determined
hosts, the contention and its cause
the
commencement of the
neutral,
merely perfor
"making
it our duty to gather to
both ancient
and modern, as may prove interesting
ake note of the
vicissitudes of war, mark its various phases, fine, to do our best
to lay clearly before our readers the histo acts experiences and
argumentsâ€”relating to the much-discusse orset question."
As most of our readers are awar leading journals especially
intended for the perusal of ladies has been for many years the media
for the exchange of a vast nur of letters and papers touching
the use of the Corset. The destions relating to the history of
this apparently indispensable ticle of ladies' attire, its construction,
application, and influence on the figure have become so numerous of late
that we have thought, by embodying all that we can glean and garner
relating to Corsets, their wearers, and the various costumes worn by
ladies at different periods, arranging the subject-matter in its due order
as to dates, and at the same time availing ourselves of careful illustration
when needed, that an interesting volume would result.
