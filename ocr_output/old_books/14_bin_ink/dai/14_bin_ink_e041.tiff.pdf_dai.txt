If any chance to grow a little plumper than the rest, they presently cry,

she be naturally fat and lusty, yet by her dieting she is made as
slender as a broomstick. By this means one woodcock or another is
caught in their springe."

So i be seen that the waist and its
adornme considered at t early period of the world's history
matters no ordinary importance, and whether the term strophium,
zone, mitra, custula, stays, bodice, or corset is made use of, the end
sought to be obtained by their aid was the same.
Constant mention is made by early writers of the peplus as being a
very elegant garment, and there are notices of it as far back as the
Trojan war, and the ladies of Troy appear to have generally worn it.
On the authority of Strutt, it may be stated to have been "a thin light
mantle worn by Grecian ladies above the tunic;" and we read that
Antinous presented to Penelope a beautiful large and variegated
peplus, having twelve buckles of gold, with tongues neatly curved.
The peplus, however, was a very splendid part of the lady's dress, and
it is rarely mentioned by Homer without some epithet to distinguish it
enus.
