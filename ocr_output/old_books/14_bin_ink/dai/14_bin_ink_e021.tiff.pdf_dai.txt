THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.

Investigation proves to us that the taste for slender waists prevailed
even more in the Eastern nations than in those of Europe, and we find
that other means besides that of compression have been extensively
taken advantage of. Humboldt, in his personal narrative, describes the
women of Java, and informs us that the reddish clay called "ampo" is
eaten by them in order that they may become slim, want of plumpness
being a kind of beauty in that country. Though the use of this
earth is fatal to health, those desirous of profiting by its reducing
qualities persevere in its consumption. Loss of appetite and inability to
partake of more than most minute portions of food are not slow in
bringing the wished-for consummation about. The inhabitants of
Ceylon make a perfect study of the training of the figure to the most
slender proportions. Books on the subject are common in that country,
and no young lady is considered the perfection of
onable elegance
unless a great number of qualities and graces sessed; not the
least of these is a waist which can be quite
clasped with
two hands; and, as we proceed with our
standard for the perfection of waist
world-wide. From the coral-fringed

the subject:-

of the far-famed beauties of Circassia? The women wear a corset made of
