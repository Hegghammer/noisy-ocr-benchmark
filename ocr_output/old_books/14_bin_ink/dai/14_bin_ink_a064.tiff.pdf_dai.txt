Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
Turkish rule? To this question, we must answer an emphatic No!
The causes that must operate against any change are many and deep-
seated. In the first place it cannot be expected that a few Turks of liberal
ideas (or it may be French polished) at Constantinople, are going to change
the thought and character of the nation. The characteristics of a people
change very slowly, if they ever change at all, and the predominant national
traits of the many-blooded modern Turk have been shown to the world to
be, cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a fierce sensuality; and what is
more than all, and which has to be remembered most, is, that they are a
people accustomed to the unbridled gratification of their worst passions.
The ethnographic traits of the Turkman which history bears out, are

a Mahommedan, is enough-Cela suffit.
To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans, and
intimate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahommedan is above all things a Mahommedan. His
religion is the paramount question in his life, and remains its predominating
feature above everything else. This should not be surprising, since to the
“faithful" Paradise is secured, and all crimes and transgressions against
"unbelievers" absolved.
