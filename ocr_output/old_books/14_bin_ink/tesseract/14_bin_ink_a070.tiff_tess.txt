victims in thy Yildiz Kiosk, found its way to thy treacherous heart. No
poisoned cup of coffee like the countless cups brewed in thy palaces trickled
down thy throat to end thy vampire existence.

Thou hast lived! Protected from the Nemesis of thy crimes by the
jealousies and rivalries of great powers whjgd@fhou artfully played one against
another ; by the combined forces of religg plunder which thou cunningly
wielded into one. Even so thou erless living example in the
civilized twentieth century of t rime.

In the foregoing pag my humble efforts to sketch out
what the Powers of Europ he past, and how their actions
have reflected on my unforty

It is considered good po certain class of European writers
to ascribe all the horrors of th \Massacres to Hamid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as and unconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as a sort o 1 being who swept everything
before him to the consummation o spotic will. The reason for
this is not difficult to perceive. Th in disavow the part Europe
has played in the tragedy, and to do fully it becomes necessary
also to present Turkey to the world 1 radise (from whence the
tyrant once removed) peopled only by angels ; so we have also
many roseate colored word pictures of ] Turkey.

The murders, deportations and impr f the Turkish revolu-
tionaries, or more correctly reformers, were dly the sole work of
Abdul Hamid and his palace clique, but Abdul a inintons could not
have carried out that hellish work of wholesale ermination of the

Armenians without the perpetration and participation of the Turkish
people. It is true the massacres were originated and organized in the
Palace, the Palace clique stirred up religious fanaticism and race hatred, but
the co-operation of the people was necessary ; and the people co-operated
in order to plunder and enrich themselves with the worldly goods that the
Armenians always knew how to acquire by their own industry and toil; the
appeal to their marauding and bestia] instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
