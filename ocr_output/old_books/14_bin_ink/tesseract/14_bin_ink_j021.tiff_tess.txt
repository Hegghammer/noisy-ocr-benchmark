CANING SUGGESTIONS 17
holes are bored and ‘utilized in the cane weaving. These are not
absolutely necessary; in fact caned areas on many pieces of period
and modern furniture do not utilize corner holes. In such instances

hole, and the other not, will lead the observer to conclude that the
former appears complete while the latter appears unfinished.
