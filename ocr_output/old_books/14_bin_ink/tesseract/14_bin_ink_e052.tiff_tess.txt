“Item: Pro ix ulnis radii, Pariensis pro robas cestivas corsetto et clochia
pro eodem.” *
The persons for whom these garments were made were Richard,
King of the Normans, and Edward, his son, whose death occurred in the
year 1308. So that corsets were, even in those early days, used by ,
gentlemen as well as ladies.
The term kirtle, so often referred to, may not clearly convey to the
mind of the modern reader the nature of the garment indicated by it,
and therefore it may not be amiss to give Strutt’s description of it. He
says, “The kirtle, or, as it was anciently written ‘kertel, is a pagt of the
dress used by the men and the women, but especially atter. It
was sometimes a habit of state, and worn by rank.” The
: garment sometimes called a “ surcojes kirtle, and we

textures and of different co y of green; and sometimes

they were laced closely to the body} robably answered the purpose

of the bodice or stays—vide Launfal, before referred to :—

“ Their kirtles were of rede cendel,
I laced smalle, jollyf, and well.”

To appear in a kirtle only seems to have been a mark of servitude.
Thus the lady of Sir Ladore, when he feasted the king, by way of
courtesy waited at the table—

“The lady was gentyll and small, . ,
In kirtle alone she served in hall.”

We are further informed that at the close of the fifteenth century it
was used as a habit of penance, and we read that Jane Shore, when
performing penance, walked barefoot, a lighted taper in her hand, and
