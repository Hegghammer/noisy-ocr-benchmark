often very richly ornamented with furs and. costly needlework. As
fashion changed, dresses were made with open fronts, so as to be worn
over the surcoat without altogether concealing it. A portrait of Marie
d’ Anjou, Queen of France, shows this arrangement of costume. The waist
appears very tightly laced, and the body of the surcoat much resembles the
modern bodice, but is made by stiffening and cut to perform the part of
a very strong and efficient corset. Until the termination of the fourteenth

agrafes. The under-sleey of peculiar construction, and are |
visible, are crimson vely to the centre of the hand. They
are cut out at the white puflings of the same material as
the chemisette pr, rough the openings.” In both France and
