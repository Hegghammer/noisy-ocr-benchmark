THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
I went in and stood on the floor of our house my
heart was thumping within me at the thought of
what was before.
And there was the pot boiling over the fire with
a few green herbs in it. There was Saba, my
mother, stirring the last handful of meal ang§ngst
the green herbs. And there were my b rs,
all older than I, sitting by the fire, wai r
the herbs and the meal to be ready.
When my mother looked toward us s
man from the strange boat. She th
some crime had been committed by me
to bring a man of such high degree Ss.
She and my brothers were greatly afral
were poor, and those who were high w
to them. But the stranger spoke softly,
“Good fortune has come to you from th
to-day.”” And when they all turned toward
he said, “I who am very knowledgeable will tak
your son with me as an apprentice, and I shall
instruct him in arts and crafts and mysteries.”
My mother said, “The boy is young, sir, and we
thought he would be with us for a time longer.”
