Thus it became the fate of the unfortunate Armenians to be the bruised
and mangled shuttle-cock of powerful bats.
Much has been written and much has been said by great authorities,
(far more comprehensively ani by pens much more forcible than my humble
efforts could’ aspire to reach) against the selfishness and callousness, the
inhumanity and cynicism of those great powers which have coldly looked on
and permitted the hellish atrocities and horrors of the Armenian Massacres.
The name of William Ewart Gladstone is loved and revered by Armenians
all over the world; but the thunderings of that veteran statesman and the
denouncing protests of those thoughtful men whose feelings of revolted
humanity have made themselves heardj\ sounding language, have fallen on
stony ground ; they have been like the of men crying out in the wilder-
ness. Europe has turned a deaf ear condemnations of justice and
truth, even as she has turned a deaf e voice of Rahel weeping for
her slaughtered children.
