of blackened ruins, the stark walls of the chureles and houses rising up out of the ashes and
cliurred timbers heaped on every side. What must it mean to the five thousand men and
wonien and little children who have survived a painful flight to the seacoast and have now
returned to their mountain home, only to find their houses sacked and burned! There were
nine Christian villages whieh clustered about Kegsab in the valleys below. Several of these
have been completely destroyed by tire. All have been plundered and the helpless people
driven out or slain.”

“Can you imegine the feelings of the Kessab people as they climbed on foot the lung trail
up the mountain, a as they came over the ridge into full view oftheir charred and
ruined dwellings ? sheat, barley and rice had been burned ; clothing, eooking
utensils, furniture an mecoats, cows and mules had been stolen; their silk
industries stamped out d to smouldering heaps. The bodies of
their friends and relat’ en buried. «And yet the love of
home is so strong that th ith the determination to clear up
the debris and rebuild the ack of Kessab,” Stephen Van h.
Trowbridge.

As these sheets are 3 s there comes news of famine
at Zeitoon. The Rev. FY erican Missionary at Marash,
writes to the Rev. W. W. lissionary at Constantinople, that
12,000 souls in and around ying of hunger ; they are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran an and cooking and eating it, if they can
get even that. Rev. Macullun , “The same story comes to us from all
sides. As we foresaw all alono¥Fom now on the distress will be greatest.”

If 50,000 were massacre e list of those who have died and are dying
of homelessness and starvggfon will exceed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggeragd. Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no soyfigs.

The latest news ishat Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolatioff of the massacres, has been plundered in a night attack
by armed Kurds, anfthe villagers are now reduced to extreme distress. Before
the outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeatedly appealed
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec-
tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It is
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
