o2 HISTORICAL SKETCHES OF |
“square fort with bastions” at what is now
called Barrancas, which he named San Carlos.
As the beginning, or rather reconstruction of a
town named Pensacola, he erected some houses
adjacent to the fort. And there, too, was built :
a church, historically the first ever erected on
the shores of Pensacola Bay, but presumptively
the second; for it is hardly credible that the
' large settlement of de Luna, embracing so many
ecclesiastics, should have failed to observe t
universal custom of the Spaniards to buj
church wherever they planted a colony,
sistible, therefore, is the inference tha t
notes of a church-bell heard within of
the United States were those whi over
the waters of Pensacola Bay white
hills of Santa Rosa from 1559 to :
Having demonstrated that the ement of |
de Luna was the original PensgiMa, that of }
Arriola was apparently the sq@jnd, though
actually but a resuscitation of fhe colony of
1559; for the name, the people, though not the :
same generation, and the place being one, mere
lapse of timeshould not be permitted to destroy .
