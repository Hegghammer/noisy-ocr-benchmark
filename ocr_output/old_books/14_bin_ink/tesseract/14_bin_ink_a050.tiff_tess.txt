two, the wall of iron that rises between them is the position of woman. The
Armenian has accepted whole-heartedly the position in which woman has
been placed by the Great Founder of his faith, For seventeen hundred
years unremittingly since Christianity was revived in Armenia by Gregory
the Illuminator, the Christian law with regard to the position of woman has
moulded the thought of the nation, it has left its impress on the nation, and
it is this vital and essential difference between the law of Mahommed and the
law of Christ that like a two-edged sword has cleaved apart Christian
Armenian from Moslem Turk and Persian.

If “ East is East, and Wes&is West” it ts on accou the social plane
on which woman stands, a socia¥@lane that is never graded in any
corner of Asia, as it is in the cou where the lay ommed governs,

The Armenians in Asiatic Tu are scatt ispersed among
Turks and other antagonistic race re ya military force or
organization to wrest autonomy fi governing power.
That Europe should aid their endea should make them
a free gift of autonomy, are both o m out of the question.
Then what remains for us?

To hold to our own nationality and to t—Subject to Russia,
subject to Turkey, subject to Persia—\vhat profit us? What will
it profit? What doth it profit us? Our str ver, energetic men, our
beautiful, intelligent women, when neither cha r Opportunity can enable
our finest and best to reach the higher rung the world’s ladder, and
when as a subject people we must ever remai wers of wood and drawers
of water, even our Aivasowskis and our Melis have been i:nown to the
world as Russians, notas Armenians. Haveffe a chance of bursting the
fetters? Have we strength to break the chaffis? Can we reach the goal
toward which, bleeding and torn, we have been Striving, and still are striving?
These are questions which we must ask ourselves ; looking them soberly in
the face.

But this is not enough: if we must persist in holding to our our national-
ity, we must look into ourselves, we must search out and probe our national
failings and our national weaknesses, and find out in what essential character-
istics we are wanting as a nation, and so build up national character. Let
us weigh ourselves in the balance, and supply what in us is found wanting.

In the period of less than a decade a Great Power has risen in the
Orient. The people of a small island empire with an empty Treasury have
beaten successfully and disastrously a colossal empire of whom the Powers
of Europe had stood in awe, and against whom not one had ventured single-
handed to engage.
