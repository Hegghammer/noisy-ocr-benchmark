was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples whieh with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engage in
eommerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase the value of
the Ottoman Empire. Beeause a few among them justly started an agitation, these our noble
and industrious brethren were being massacred. What a terrible scence! When we
left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our Armenian compatriots being
removed in myguure carts ; legs and arms were hanging down outside. This bloody scene will
ever remain i ssc on my mind.

“This shock ane of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a et solutism, up to the last moment, grew wider. Iven during the
past nine months of t Btion, in spite of the brotherly feelings which had been shown,
the awful events in Ad? eand the souls of all true Osmuniizs amelted into tears.
Up to the present time ¢ a ' red, beeause this
bloody wo : our stomachs with
choice morsels, ¥ rerless and brotherless
orphans, widows hungry bither, and thousands of
families are fleeing from the falt™ government is doing its
work, but what has happened is so meee government buzy for
years. However much sacrifice wé BeSlejuate, because the
happiness of the fatherland depends on 5 Bee as soon as possible,
We are convineed that the government al eted with Bed of this as well as
ourselves. We must now wipe out the trad he misfortune brouw y a eursed period.
We must now comfort weeping hearts. We*must understand and teach Those who do not
understand that patriotism and brotherhood (> not differ from each other. The responsibility
of the government for the Armenians is very great and very weighty. The whole Ottoman
nation is under obligations to proteet this suffering race, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
is in large part due to the blood shed by the Armenians. We thought that these truths
were so obvious that we preferred to keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
neeessary from time to time to recall the greatness of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yesterday has endured only barbarism, and for twelve years
has been constantly oppressed and ground to the earth, and has given thousands of victims.
Hereafter we must work to assure them that the era of massacres has passed, and with all our
strength of mind and soul we must quiet them. The obligation of the government to protect
them is also very heavy, because our Armenian countrymen live among wandering tribes.
We must all assist the government and point out its obligation. It must be declared in
publie and periodically that the one of the most important duties of the Ottoman nation is to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and property of the
Armenians as well, since these are their saered rights. Let investigations be made and let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim.”

This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare disclose
his identity ; and the account given by an authority like Mr. James Bryce
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as “les Massacres occasionnés par les aventuriers Arméniens.”
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
