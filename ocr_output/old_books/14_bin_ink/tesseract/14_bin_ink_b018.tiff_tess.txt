4 : CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
No. III.
Two CoucHant Lions, AFTER RUBENS, taken from his celebrated picture before alluded
° to, of the Prophet Danield the den. The Lions are here supposed to be miraculously
‘ 00, is not much Expression, but an extraordinary grandeur
ion where the Deity himself especially interferes
to seal up rible of his creatures, in calm submission. There
is a character of royal av submission, which is very impressive, and even
sublime.

The writer esteems this to storation of the Nature that was wanting in the
prints of this subject, (which has o ved by Picaxr and others,) after Rubens. The
original picture it has been our ill- io have seen. The shaggy manes, and tlie latent
terror that sits gloomily enthroned in es of the superior Lion—suited to the darkness of
the den, and the nature of this anim of vision,—are as well thought of, as they are
executed ; and are varied with much ad m the closed eyes of the couching Lion beyond,
of which also the character is most hap arked. A powerful and divine spell possesses
them both. |

No. IV.

Tne TIGER WHICH MARCHES IN OUR PROCESSION, without an object before him to call
forth emotion, possesses a calm character, combined with the resistless strength of that dreadful
quadruped ; whose very tranquillity, in his leisure sauntering, when no excitement is acting on his
nerves, lias an appalling effect.—His brow is clouded, though his claws are sheathed. There is a
possibility of a dreadful storm which may not be far distant, and that is enough to stamp the
Tiger’s character. None shall dare to arouse his energies, nor to encounter them when aroused.

No. V. .

THIS GROUP OF PLAYFUL Lroparps, arrer RuBEns, must be supposed to belong to the
Jocund train of Bacchus, since they are luxuriating at their ease, among grapes and vine branches.
These Leopards are doubtless intended to have a degree of playful expression—induced perhaps by
the exhilarating juice of the grape: and we should “ guess” (as Jonathun says) that this group

was studied from a litter of half-grown kittens. Few, however, except the sailors who were
accustomed to gambol with the Tiger-cub on board the Pitt East-Indiaman, would hike to venture
to frolic with them.
