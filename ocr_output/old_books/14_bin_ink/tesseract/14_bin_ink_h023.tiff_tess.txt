Jeremiah also settled in Massachusetts. ‘There was a John Horton in
New York, in 1645, but no one has been found claiming descent from
him. He probably returned to England.

It is not known from what place in England either Thomas or Jere-
miah came, nor is there any certain evidence that they were brothers
of Barnabas, but the three coming over about the same time would
favor the tradition that they were brothers.

The Head Quarters of Caesar's army was near the present Leccester,
the principal town of that county, and the Horton name has been
known there to the remotest periogl of any authentic records. This
fact, together with the name itself favors the idea that the family was
of Roman origin. The name ## olden time was frequently written
Orton, and it is highly proba that the Ortons and Hortons were
originally from the same famg™fand perhaps also the Nortons.

2. Joseph, born about 15 Burke's Landed Gentry, vol. 1, p. 745.

It is held that this Jo¥eph settled in Mousely, Leicester Co., and
was the father of Barnabas Horton. It is highly probable that Bar-
nabas was not the oldest son, and not inheriting real estate, may have
been one reason for his emigrating to America.

It is known that Capt. Jeremy Horton, 18 Aug., 1626, was the
master and owner of the ship ‘‘.Swa//ow,’’ of Barnstable, and that he
made voyages to New England, in 1633 and 1638, and in a subsequent
voyage hé was shipwrecked and several lives lost—the crew and master
came to Boston, but the vessel was lost.

Capt. Roger Horton, about this time, had a prisoner delivered to
