rail 1 and up at the inner corner, then over the top and edge of rail
2. This binds the loose end in place if it has not been previously
tacked. Pull the strand directly across the frame opening to the
top of rail 3 at corner B. Draw it over the edge of the same rail

corner, or until the seat is completed. This applies to square seats
only. The end of the last strand may be secured with a tack under
the proper rail, or twisted around a strand underneath the seat.

The strand is twisted as the weaving progresses. ‘This may be
done with the palm of the hand and thigh, in much the same man-
ner as a shoemaker waxes his thread. If onggeaf of rush is used to
make the strand, new leaves are adde the two ends ina

Some expert rush seaters do not tie knots in making str:
add leaves by twisting the end of the preceding leaf about th

marked. Adding by twisting only is difficult, and requires grea
patience and dextrous handling of the material. In fact rush
should be used by the more skilful boys only. Others may use the
excellent substitute, fiber.
