Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have clung to their christian faith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure.

The cathedral of Etchmiatzin built by Gregory still stands to-day ; it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, until perhaps
little of the original building may be left, but it still claims to be the chygceh
built by the patron saint of Armenia. I shall here quote a m
“ Historical Sketch of the Armenian Church,” writt n
priest :

“Owing to political circum t
times to be transferred f
Armenia. In th '
in 1114 to R6mklah, and in 12
extinct, and, we having no more a kingdom
was natural and proper to re-transfer the
the entire nation unanimously desired it.

- was decided by an ecclesiastical meeting
return to Holy Etchmiatzin, where
proper unbroken succession from ler,
St. Gregory the Illuminator.”

I read the other day in apers published in Japan,
the following piece of news .

“An Armenian Ch nounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christiarffera, has been discovered in a fair state of preserva-
tion in the neighbourhood of Bash-Aparnah.”

Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light on Armenian history.
