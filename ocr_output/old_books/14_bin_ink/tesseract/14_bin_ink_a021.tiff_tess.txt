earth as other nations? Does Humanity, does Christianity allow that tender
babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and butchered
before the eyes of their mothers, or that the ears of mothers should be rent
with the cries of the dying agony of their.murdered children? Does
Humanity; Christianity allow that helpless women should be forcibly
subjected to tf woous, the most loathsome, the most revolting, and
