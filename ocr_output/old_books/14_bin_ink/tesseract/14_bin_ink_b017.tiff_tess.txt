CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. 3

Ivery artist does best, that which he is best qualified and best disposed to do. In com-
pleting the number of plates that has been found necessary for the Work, Mr. Epwin LANDSEER
has chosen to proceed toward the same purpose, upon a different principle. He has gone, without
any introductory medium, directly to the living animals, and has exhibited the savage manners and
habits of these quadrupeds, according to his own ideas and observations.

’ On the distinction between CHARACTER and EXPRESSION, we shall now deliver our opinion.
By the Character of an animal, we mean those peygdf™@encies of his look and features which he
always offers to view when in a placid, or unit state: by his Haxpression, the variations
of muscular action superinduced on char: is liable, as the storms of passion sweep
by, and his mind becomes agitated by ext acting on the ardours of his instinct.

The former, seems to hold its cou assy parts: the latter, agitates, oft-
times rebelliously, the nerves and , r present, both in the animal coun-
tenance, and in the “human fac © expression does not proscribe, or
obliterate, character. Individuality con coM@erns external appearance ; and it
forms the system of vowels of the language o which no Expression could be.

Whoever regards the faces of a flock of Sheep, w 2 an infinite variety of Character,
with very little Expression, and that little without diversit if we descend a step lower in
the scale of being, and contemplate the finny tribe, where ChaM¥gr is not wanting, we find no
Expression at all. Even Trees and inanimate objects, possess Character. We recollect a poetical
friend of ours, now in Italy, saying that every tree and every rock had a faee—but of this we are
not so certain ; though very certain, that there is enough of Character in rocks and trees, to make
a poet think so.

Character and Expression, in the carnivorous class of animals, to which we here solicit
attention, are always co-existent — their proportions varying with the existing occasions—in
pictorial exhibitions of such subjects.

Tene is much Character, and little Expression, in the reposing Leopard with his sheathed
claws, which is shewn in the present engraving, copied by Mr. Spizspury from RiDINnGER, and
corrected from Nature. RipINGER was an artist of great power, who studied wild animals in
their sequestered haunts, as is shewn in his grand forest back-grounds ; and who, generally
speaking, left little or no room for others to improve, except on some few of his inferiér works.
The present is an interesting and beautiful animal, yet there is a latent capability of mischief
characterised in his countenance, and we might ask, in the language of Job, “ Who shall dare to
rouse him up ?”
