PREFACE
+o
Tue subject which we have here treated is a sort of

battle-field, where fierce contests have for ages bee

waged; and, notwithstanding the determi

hosts, the contention and its cau the

commencement of th eutral,
merely per »” making

it our duty to gather , both ancient

and modern, as may prove interestin e note of the

vicissitudes of war, mark its various phases, ne, to do our bes

to lay clearly before our readers the hist cts—experiences and

arguments—relating to the much-discuss rset question.”

As most of our readers are awa leading journals especially

intended for the perusal of ladies h een for many years the media

for the exchange of a vast nu of letters and papers touching

the use of the Corset. Th estions relating to the history of

this apparently indispensable@ffticle of ladies’ attire, its construction,

application, and influence onffie figure have become so numerous of late

that we have thought, bygémbodying all that we can glean and garner

relating to Corsets, th€ir wearers, and the various costumes worn by

ladies at different periods, arranging the subject-matter in its due order |

as to dates, and at the same time availing ourselves of careful illustration |

when needed, that an interesting volume would result.
