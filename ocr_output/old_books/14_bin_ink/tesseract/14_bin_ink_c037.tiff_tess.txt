came into Babylon. No city in the world is as
mighty or as wonderful as Babylon. It has three
hundred and sixty-five streets, and in every street
there are three hundred and sixty-five palaces,
and to every palace there are three hundred and
sixty-five steps leading up to its door of gold and
ebony. The streets when we came into them
were thronged with might}\ black-bearded men. I
was much in dread when (stood in those great
streets, and looked on the hty men who went
through them.

In the center of the city we e palace and the
wide-spreading gardens of t ing. In those
gardens, as my master told me, ne or two of
all the beautiful or terrible ani the world.
Those gardens I will speak O King,
for it was within them t on the
danger that was greater that
I am now in.
