In many localities it is impossible to find a professional to reseat
caned chairs either by hand or with cane webbing. Many chairs
in good repair and worthy are relegated to the attic because of
broken or sunken seats. Upholsterers generally will not be troubled

they are not adept enough to do such odd jobs as may come to them,
even tho willing to do the work, within a time consistent with
sufficient money returns,

Chairs of ordinary size may be caned for a minimum of $1 and
a maximum of $2. If the holes have previously been bored, much
labor is thus avoided, and the charge is naturally made less. “The
professional cane weaver has various ways by which he determines
the cost for recaning a given seat. Perhaps the most common
method employed is that of rging so much per hole. This is

a factor in deciding what to char; a casual looking over
of the chair by the expert is all tha x aprice. No
charge of less than $1 on a hand eenitly re-
