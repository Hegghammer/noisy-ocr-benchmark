like a round bow, a great brown eye revealed the inward spirit’s intelligence and zeal un-
quenched. On his head was a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.

Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century’s greatest men—Merditech
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people—slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Mtchmiatzin, or “ The Ouly-Begotten
is Descended.” From the window of «a neighboring room, he might have looked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were nog all cut close and buried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark inass of whirling fjow and hurricane that hid the
cone of Ararat. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, BK puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of that lake, eighty-seven years ago, Khrimianfi& born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land ; the Sultar counted as one of the formid-
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byro ut to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as th ous champion of freedom—a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives thr the Near Wast. Jong and
stormy had been the life upon which the Natholikes no back, but not unhappy, for
from first to it liad been inspired by one absorbing fish aim—the freedom and
recencration of his is true he had failed.

From his earliest mpossed th Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians roun of uationality—such a
spirit as only kindles in oppre to e tolerance among the
prosperous and contented of the 3 wandering far and wide through
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian se « Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poe ries of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wife’s ¢ elf to the building of schools,
which he generously threw open to Kurds, the of Armenians. For many
years, while Europe was occupied with Crimean wa s, or French and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying from Van ople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continual is schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emblems of the Host hu Kery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenian patriarch of Constantinople was driven from
his office after four years.

But the cup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiless slaughter ulgarigns and
Armenians alike was more than even the Suropean Powers could stand. WithXyried motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to plead his people’s cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Europe
heforchand, urging them to create an autonomous neutral state for Armenia, as they had
done with success for the Lebanon. In London he became acquainted with Gladstone ; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and,
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey’s definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London amid shouts of “ Peace with Honor,”
and Armenia was left to stew.

So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerugalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake:
