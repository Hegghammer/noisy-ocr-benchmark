32 Seventh Generation.—Joseph f.

He possesses fine social qualities, and, since retiring from business, he °
occasionally amuses himself in hunting and fishing. His integrity,
industry and great business capacities, during the active part of his
life, rendered him a most valuable acquisition to the community in
which he carried on his business, and the articles he manufactured
were of sterling value to the farming interests of the country.

Mr. Horton, on sending me his photograph for an engraving,
accompanied it with the following very modest and unassuming sketch
of his life:

‘“*f was born in Yorktown, Westchest .

September, 1806. m.-
stances. I remained v the
farm in the summer, and fing
merely a common-school é€ Id,
at the suggestion of my pal pith
trade, and commenced the Db en-
ticeship for several years. On ried
Phebe Tompkins, and on the 9th eks-
kill village, where we have resided pro-
perty, and set up the blacksmithing b the
business. In the spring of 1835 I ent busi-
ness with Mr. Truman Minor, under the Hor-
ton,’ and went into the foundry business, Itural
implements, principally ploughs and ploug siness
increased rapidly, and paid us well. We rs for
twenty years. In 1855 Mr. Minor retired fron I took
in Mr. Geo. W. Depeu as a partner, and about ty¥ wards,
we admitted each of us a son, and the firm then orton,
Depeu & Sons.’ Our manufactured articles were sol every
State in the Union, and also in many foreign countries.

‘In 1862 we all sold out to a stock company, formed at pur-
pose. Having been in active business for thirty years, J n¥jJ retired.
In the spring of 1855 I was elected Supervisor of the townf Cort-
landt, and I represented that town in the Board of Supervisors for five
years In succession.

‘In the winter of 1858, ] was a member of the I egislature from
this Assembly District. For many years I held the various offices of
our village, but of late have declined official stations, preferring the
enjoyments of private life.’”’

Mr. Horton is not a public professor of Christianity, but is a gen-
tleman of correct moral deportment, and very temperate in his habits.
