THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE. 49 |
having only her kirtle upon her back. John Gower, however, who
wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus describes a company ‘of
ladies. ‘They were, says he, “clothed all alike, in kirtles with rich capes
or mantles, parti-coloured, white, and blue, embroidered all over with
various devices.” Their bodies are described as being long and small,
and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though each of the
had been a queen. We find that the tight-laced young ladies of Mle |
court of the Lady Triamore “had mantles of green-coloured yet, | .
handsomely bordered with gold, and Jined with rich furs, They@ifeads
were neatly attired in kerchiefs, and were ornamented with cut and,
richly-striped wires of gold, and upon their kerchiefs they ach of |
them a pretty coronal, embellished with sixty gems or and of
their pretty mistress it is said in the same poem, that were as
red as the rose when it first blossoms. Her hair er head
like golden wire, falling beneath a crown of gol ted with
precious stones. Her vesture was purple, and th white |
ermine, was also elegantly furred with the sam lanche,
the daughter of Edward III, the subject of ced tration,
appears to have copied closely the dress above ed, an@ike the
maids of honour of the Lady Triamore herself, Is not oM™ richly
habited but thoroughly well-laced as well. Thus Fre see, in Ye year
1361, the full influence of the corset on the costume of thatperiod.
There is another poem, said to be more ancient than even [Munfal,
which, no doubt, ‘served to give a tone and direction,to the fashlcns of
times following after. Here we find a beautiful lady described as
wearing a splendid girdle of beatén gold, embellished with rubies and
emeralds, about her middle small.
Gower, too, when describing a lover who is in the act of admiring
his mistress, thus writes:— — -
*‘ He seeth hir shape forthwith, all
Hir bodye round, hir middle small.”
