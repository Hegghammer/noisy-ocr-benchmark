2 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

the scene of which, by the way, he has not represented as a royal menagerie, but as a wild,

rocky cavern—his animals partake of the artificial character of which we cannot bring ourselves to
approve. .

Of this fact, however, we purpose to exhibit proof with our assertion. Improved versions, to

the best abilities of our Artists, of some of these Lions of RuBENs and the Assyrian king, will here

introduced, which the reader, who pleases, may compare with the originals. Our second, third,

urth Plates are of the number.

ions of RuBENS are humanized. We do not intend to discuss at length whether the

corical painting required this: we only state the fact: yet the opinions which we

sm on the subject, we feel at liberty to utter. So much in apology for using the

hi t ads of many of the Lions of RuBEns rather resemble those of frowning

old illies wigs ; as if Nature’s journeymen had made manes, and not

mad ion of flowing and curling hair, which seems rather to solicit

the un ve endured the torrid heats of the desert, or the rough
storms st. The Sts ane is a very different sort of thing.

How uch dressed Lions may D to accord with Aliegory, they are demonstrably
at varianceWith Nature. To be sure, what mig come a Lion in the procession of the Cardinal
Virtues, might be rather unsuitable in lris den, or withi®age precincts of those wild haunts, where he
is accustomed to roam in his natural state. We have often dead of the fabled Men-bulls, or (Mino-
taurs,) and we find suck on the coinage of Crete. These allegorical creatures of RuBENs, which,
alas! have sometimes been quoted by Artists without half his genius, and placed in savage con-
flicts, or beside their Britannias—are a species of Men-lions. Placed among the Saban sculp-
tures, they might pass for mearnations of Sol in Leo; but would very ill pass for Leo alone.

Among the observers of this poetic improvement, or this natural and unpoetical deficiency, on
the part of Rusens, Trrian, Jcx1o Romano, and other painters, both ancient and modern; and
of the consequent desideratum on the part of the public, of a cabinet or library collection of the
nobler wild animals in a state of Nature, so as to answer the purposes of reference, while they con-
duced to the pleasures of Taste, were Mr. Epncar Spitspury and Mr. Tuomas LANDSEER.
Whether or not the public “looked up to them for light” on that subject, (to use the language of
STERNE,) they thought the Public “deserved it;” and they therefore, as the best practical means
of eliciting that light, first copied the general forms and attitudes of most of the wild animals that
appear in this book, from the old masters—generally speaking, from works that are well known
—and then, went to Nature and corrected the details. They carried with them what, in those
ancient masters, was meritorious in composition, attitude and chiaroscuro, and brought away,
to the best of their ability—superadding it to, and blending it with, the above—accuracy of
detail.
