PREFACE. Vil
writing in praise of the moderate use of Corsets take their facts,
experiences, and grounds of argument from the every-day life and
general custom of the present period. |

mutable modes affected by ladies, from season to season, to be omitted
from any volume which treats of Fashion. The same facts, indeed, may be
stated of both the Crinoline and the Corset. Both appear to be equally
indispensable toghe woman of the present period. To make them
serve the purpos¢ increased cleanliness, comfort, and grace, not only
without injury to hb. but with positive and admitted advantage |
to the physigue— problems to be solved by those whose
business it is to ever-changing taste and fashion of

‘the day. |
