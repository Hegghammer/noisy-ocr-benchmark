THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
arms from around my neck, and my brothers
kissed me farewell. Then the man from the
strange boat opened the door of our wattled house
and went out, and I followed him.

We did not go back to the place where he had
left his boat of brass. We went to another place
where there was a harbor with ships. There we
found a ship ready to sail for Urth.

My master sent me on board to ask the cap-
tain if he would take us on a voyage beyond Urth.
The captain said that if my master would guide
them past the Magnetberg he would give him the
ship to sail where he would after the cargo had been
landed. My master haid he would do this, and we
went on board the sh. It was evening now, and
a breeze came up, fd the ship sailed away,
bringing me from th ce where I was born and
reared and toward th ange countries that were
beyond the rim of a. I asked one of the
sailors what was the etberg, and he told me
that it was a mountal adstone that drew the
iron out of ships t near it and left them
loosened timbers ypon th ter.
