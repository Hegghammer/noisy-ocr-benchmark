In simple narrative the author carries the reader through appailing
scenes of horror, and as we read we are made to realize the slaughter of
the enemy’s machine guns, of their ground-mines, electric-wire entangle-
ments, and exploding shells ; we are made to hear the roar of the artillery
fire dealing death and destruction, and there rises before us the mental vision
of the fierce hand to hand conflict, and the dead and dying lying thickly in
the dark ravine.

“ For hill and battle plain,
With dying men and slain,
Grew mountain heights of pain,
And mine is boundless woe.”

The grim warrior who stormed and took the most impregnable fortress
in the world gives expression to his feelings on his own great achievement,
in saddest words.

“And mine is boundless woe,”

For the grim warrior’s heart is cleft in twain for the human bullets that

under his command hurled themselves to their death.
