10 THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE,

bles of the tribe were not slow in discovering that, when arrayed

in all the panoply of forest finery, a belt well drawn in, as shown in the
annexed illustration, served to display the figure to much greater advan-
tage than one carelessly or loosely adjusted. Were, then, we find the
first indication of the use of the corset as an article of becoming attire. |
At the very first dawn of civilisation there are distinct evidences of the
use\gf contrivances for the reduction and formation of the female figure. |
Res@Mches among the ruins of Polenqui, one of the mysterious forest cities |
of ยง America, whose history is lost in remote antiquity, have brought

to li st singular evidences of the existence of a now forgotten
race. st the works of art discovered there is a bas-relief repre-
sentin figure, which, in addition to a profusion of massive
orname a complicated and elaborate waist-bandage, which,

by a sy ar and transverse folding and looping, confines the
waist fr the ribs to the hips as firmly and compactly as

the most of the present day.

At t discovery of some of the islands of the
Eastern Al ound customary for all young females to
wear a p t, formed of spirally-arranged rattan
cane, and tl ntil the celebration
of the marri were slowly advancing in the

|} march of ci veryNpy the early navigators, became
more and mo ed to the use A clothing, to adjust and retain
which, waistbands would become essentrMly requisite. These, when
made sufficiently broad to fit without undue Kiction, and stiff enough to
prevent folding together in the act of stoo\ng, sitting, or moving
about, at once became in effect corsets, and suggested to the minds
of the ingenious a system of cutting and fitting so 4s more perfectly to
adapt them to the figure of the wearer. The modes of fastening, as
we shall see, have been various, from the simple sewing together with
the Jace to the costly buckle and jewelled loop and stud.
