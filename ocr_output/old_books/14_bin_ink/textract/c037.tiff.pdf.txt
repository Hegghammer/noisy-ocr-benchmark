THE STORY OF EEAN THE FISHERMAN'S SON
on the ass, and the ass is driven back over the
mountains into the country that they came from,
these men.
And in such boats we went down the river and
came into Babylon. No city in the world is as
mighty or as wonderful as Babylon. It has three
hundred and sixty-five streets, and in every street
there are three hundred and sixty-five palaces,
and to every palace there are three hundred and
sixty-five steps leading up to its door of gold and
ebony. The streets when we came into them
were thronged with mighty black-bearded men. I
was much in dread when stood in those great
streets, and looked on the I xhty men who went
through them.
In the center of the city wei
e palace and the
wide-spreading gardens of th
ing. In those
gardens, as my master told me,
one or two of
all the beautiful or terrible anii
the world.
Those gardens I will speak
O King,
for it was within them th
pon the
danger that was greater than
that
I am now in.
