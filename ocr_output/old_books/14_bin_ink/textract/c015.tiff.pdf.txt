and foot and taken into the castle of the King
There he was thrown down beside the trestles 6f
the great table, and the hot wax from the candles
that lighted the supper board dripped dous
6n
him. And it was told to
w's
sunrise k
Then the

ble. The
story could not be fink

of the stable with
a sword in his hand. And King Manus, sitting
at the supper board, CO a not eat nor refresh
himself because there W - no one at hand to finish
