HISTORICAL SKETCHES OF
"square fort with bastions" at what is now
called Barrancas, which he named San Carlos.
As the beginning, or rather reconstruction of a
town named Pensacola, he erected some houses
adjacent to the fort. And there, too, was built
a church, historically the first ever erected on
the shores of Pensacola Bay, but presumptively
the second; for it is hardly credible that the
large settlement of de Luna, embracing so many
ecclesiastics, should have failed to observe t)
universal custom of the Spaniards to bui
church wherever they planted a colony
sistible, therefore, is the inference that
st
notes of a church-bell heard within
S of
the United States were those whi
over
the waters of Pensacola Bay a
white
hills of Santa Rosa from 1559 to
Having demonstrated that the
ement of
de Luna was the original Pens
la, that of
Arriola was apparently the se and, though
actually but a resuscitation of the colony of
1559; for the name, the people, though not the
same generation, and the place being one, mere
lapse of timeshould not be permitted to destroy
