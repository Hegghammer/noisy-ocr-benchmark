CAPTAIN ALEXANDER SMITH
II
mised to steal for you." The delighted recipient
thought how exquisitely his customer's kindness
and humour blended.
There is nothing neater in all the history of
highwaymen than this anecdote, twinkling brightly
amid the matter-of-fact records of a degenerate
day.
There is plentiful evidence that when Captain
Alexander Smith in 1719-20 wrote and publis)
his work upon the highwaymen and other
doers, he based his book upon the mar
books and broadsides then in existen
of them may even now be found K
do not mind searching for them,
they will repay the trouble is q
mer
matter. He includes in his gallery
bbin
Hood and Sir John Falstaff; and, n
erned
to point out their legendary or me
lerary
character, gives an exact (though ne
ly not
a truthful) biography of each.
Several editions of Smith exist SO
h three,
others in two volumes. The title-
es vary
largely, but all are extremely leng
, and so
curious that it is well worth while t reproduce
one as on the next page.
Captain Alexander Smith took an immense
delight in his villains. You cannot fail to per-
ceive, if you read his book, that his only contempt
was for a bungler in the art. Royalist to the
heart's core of him, he expends his most loving
labours upon the freebooters who displayed his
own political bias, and there can be little doubt
VOL. I.
