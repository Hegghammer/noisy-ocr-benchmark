Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this super-added evil, is, the
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians greater marauders and
depredators than the Turks, the requl
n of whose lives comprises
murder and robbery, and
IV centuries unremittingly
quartered themselves upon the industrious CIT
ed on
the fruits of their labour and toil. Indeed as the
which
was established expressly for the Hamidian mass
d of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation W.
jors,
trained and practised in organized murder, can now
in
which they were encouraged and trained to ind
by
the Hamidian
régime.
Under all such conditions no hope of better days can be forthcoming,
no prospect of better times seems possible, for that unhappy portion of the
Armenian race whom force of circumstances keeps on the soil of the
fatherland.
The appointment of Christian governors over the provinces in-
habited by them might ameliorate some of the evils, or the other alternative,
of allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespective of creed or
nationality, would furnish some means of self-defence against the raids
and barbarities of the oppressors ; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christian peasant subject to Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his enemies, must remain one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Not the most fertile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the most assiduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, can bring to the
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
happiness, and security of life and property, which the law of all civilized
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil.
