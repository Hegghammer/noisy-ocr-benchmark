THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.

Investigation proves to us that the taste for slender waists prevailed
even more in the Eastern nations than in those of Europe, and we find
that other means besides that of compression have been extensively
taken advantage of. Humboldt, in his personal narrative, describes the
women of Java, and informs us that the reddish clay called "ampo" is
eaten by them in order that they may become slim, want of plumpness
being a kind of beauty in that country. Though the use of this
earth is fatal to health, those desirous of profiting by its reducing

and no young lady is considered the perfection of
onable elegance
unless a great number of qualities and graces
sessed ; not the

tablished to call for confirmation at our
hands, and that no pi
are spared in the formation of their figures
will be best seen b a quotation from a recent traveller who writes on
the subject :-
"What would" (he says) "our ladies think of this fashion on the part
of the far-famed beanties of Circassia? The women wear a corset made of
'morocco," and furnished with two plates of wood placed on the chest,
