occasionally amuses himself in hunting and fishing. His integrity,

were of sterling value to the farming interests of the country.

enjoyments of private life."
Mr. Horton is not a public professor of Christianity, but is a gen-
tleman of correct moral deportment, and very temperate in his habits.
