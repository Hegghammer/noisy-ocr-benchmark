CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
No. III.
Two COUCHANT LIONS, AFTER RUBENS, taken from his celebrated picture before alluded
to, of the Prophet Daniel
h
the den. The Lions are here supposed to be miraculously
held
too, is not much Expression, but an extraordinary grandeur
of an occasion where the Deity himself especially interferes
to seal up
rible of his creatures, in calm submission. There
is a character of royal dign
submission, which is very impressive, and even
sublime.
The writer esteems this to
estoration of the Nature that was wanting in the
prints of this subject, (which has of
Ived by PICART and others,) after RUBENS. The
original picture it has been our ill-fe
o have seen. The shaggy manes, and the latent
terror that sits gloomily enthroned in
es of the superior Lion-suited to the darkness of
the den, and the nature of this anima
of vision,-are as well thought of, as they are
executed ; and are varied with much add
m the closed eyes of the couching Lion beyond,
of which also the character is most hap
harked. A powerful and divine spell possesses
them both.
No. IV.
THE TIGER WHICH MARCHES IN OUR PROCESSION, without an object before lim to call
forth emotion, possesses a calm character, combined with the resistless strength of that dreadful
quadruped ; whose very tranquillity, in his leisure sauntering, when no excitement is acting on lis
nerves, las an appalling effect. - His brow is clouded, though his claws are sheathed. There is a
possibility of a dreadful storm which may not be far distant, and that is enough to stamp the
Tiger's character. None shall dare to arouse his energies, nor to encounter them when aroused.
No. V.
THIS GROUP OF PLAYFUL LEOPARDS, AFTER RUBENS, must be supposed to belong to the
jocund train of Bacchus, since they are luxuriating at their ease, among grapes and vine branches.
These Leopards are doubtless intended to have a degree of playful expression-induce perhaps by
the exhilarating juice of the grape : and we should " guess" (as Jonathun says) that this group
was studied from a litter of half-grown kittens. Few, however, except the sailors who were
accustomed to grambol with the Tiger-cub on board the Pitt East-Indiaman, would like to venture
to frolic with them.
