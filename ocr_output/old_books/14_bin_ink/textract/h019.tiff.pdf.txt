and genealogy of the early settlers of Southold-cxamining all the deeds and wills,
and other authentic documents to be found, and also copying the inscriptions from
every headstone, not only in Southold, but over nearly the whole Island-makes it
very evident that some of those named were not there at so early a date, and he
also says that Peter Hallock, who is named as one of the thirteen, was the grandson
of the Puritan Hallock who settled at Southold, and whose Christian name was
William. Mr. Moore is one of the best genealogists of the country, and in relation
to Long Island, he is the best authority extant.
ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE.

were a few huts on the east of Long Island previous
wo or
three it is said on Shelter Island. But these, as well
the Puritans, immediately on their settlement in Southold, soon all
passed away. Not a vestige of any of the first generation buildings
can be found except this one. It remained for the house that Barnabas
built to survive the wreck of ages, and to stand to-day as a noble
representative of the dwellings of two hundred and fifteen years ago.
But the old house stands to-day not only as peering above all others
by its age, but also by its occupancy. It is not very often that we find
two generations of the same name, living and dying in the same house-
rarely find three. But here we have six generations in succession, all
bearing the Horton name, living and dying in the same house, and
all born in it except Barnabas I., and his son Jonathan. We may go
to the castles and palaces of the old world, and search long and dili-
gently, and fail to find a parallel case.
With a few repairs, the old castle may yet stand for generations far
in the future.
It requires some thought and reflection to realize the lapse of time
since the old house was built. See the old Puritan himself there
twenty years ; then his son Jonathan, twenty-eight years ; and then
Jonathan, Jr., about sixty years; and next Lawrence and his son Jona-
