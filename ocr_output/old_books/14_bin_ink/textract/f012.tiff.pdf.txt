PREFACE
from Smith, who himself was prone to include
the most extraragant myths in his pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE LIVES AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAMOUS
HIGHWAYMEN. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the "truth" of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.
No one has ever reprinted those authors in
their orig 7 extravagance, or their grossness.

not be entertar

Perhaps the task has
of the difficulty-the - almos.

chilling sense that it would b

to present the highwayman as /s
a
fellow rarely heroic, generally fo

cruel, and often cowardly. No
would
be likely to thank the frank historian
his dis-
service; and I do not think the historiar who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
