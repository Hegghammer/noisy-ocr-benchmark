the last space will be a short 1/2 in. or whatever dimension is used.
In such cases it is necessary to redivide the last several spaces into
divisions as near 1/2 in. as possible. It thus becomes obvious why
spacing must be done in one direction as stated. This applies to
all rectangular frames.
With a 3/16 in. wood bit bore holes thru the rails and stiles at
the points marked. Countersink the holes slightly on the underside

power machinery is available a vertical borer
may be used for bis purpose. It is best to
carefully mark the points for boring with o center punch. The
twist bit will then start accurately and the de rer for getting out
of line will be reduced to a minimum. The dir

The numbers on the photograph refer to the steps.
Step I. A hank of cane should be soaked for a few minutes in
warm water, or longer in cold. Do not soak it too long. Start a
strand by drawing one end thru a hole next to a corner hole, and
let it project about 3 in. below. Fasten with a peg. Then starting
