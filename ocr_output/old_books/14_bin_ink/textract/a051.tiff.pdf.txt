On the field the ever victorious army of little Japan undermined Russia's
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
defeated and ever retreating army of colossal Russia. At sea the ever
victorious Japanese Fleet succeeded in completely annihilating the Russian
Fleet. It was war such as the world had never yet seen. The secret of
such astounding successes should be investigated, and here I have
quote from one of a series of
ons
during the Russo-Japanese IV
ndle of
faggots in the fable firmly tied ty
ensions in
the centre, the sovereign round
sters, and all,
ruler and people tied together by a
totism."
These remarks of mine were bas
IS of actual facts. In
national unity Japan stands as an objec
le world ; she furnishes
an example which the world needs to copi
ch a nation so politically
forlorn as ourselves more than any other ne
copy.
From the astounding success of Japan le
turn to the position the
Great Republic of the United States of Americ
occupies in the world, and
take the lesson to heart of what Union can acco,
lish as we contrast their
present position with the position that the handful
ritan pilgrims occupied
when they first landed on American soil not qui
hundred years ago.
National Unity is our greatest need it
ner which we must
raise up over our national life. National Unit
engraven on the
tablets of our minds and throb in the puls
(ts. There are
mountains of difficulties before us, and if ey
must reach the goal we
can only do so by being bound together like the bundle of faggots in the
fable, with no weakening or loosening of the bands. Then perhaps we
might once more be able to get an independent footing on the historical soil
of our fathers, and perhaps once more rally round our own flag. A Japan-
ese lives for the State, not for himself; we have no State for which to live,
but let us live for our communities whilst we keep the hope in our hearts
that communities grow into States.
We have grit and endurance in an unparalleled degree, but these
characteristics will profit us nothing if we are wanting in unity.
Let us remember that utterance of the Founder of our faith. In our
loyalty and allegiance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents of a
cataract, but we must remember His warning utterance:-
"What shall it profit a man." What shall it profit a nation.
Unity is
the soul of a nation. Let us keep our soul and not lose it.
