The Armenian Massacres
eir parallel in history. The
human mind staggers to conter
dish orgies of which they have
been the victims, and no pen cal
their horrors : and this helpless
christian people are to-day in the
deadly peril as they have been since
the famous Treaty of Berlin cons
d
them bound hand and foot to the
mercy of their executioners.
The Armenians may be led again "as sheep to the slaughter" and the
work of extermination may be completed-Jesus Christ was crucified on
Calvary and the servant is not greater than his Lord-but the work of their
extermination can only be completed when the evil influences in the Turkish
Empire have reached their culminating point. Hitherto the Powers of
Europe have by their jealousies and rivalries cultivated these evil influences,
they have watered them and made them grow, but when their culminating
point is reached, they must re-act on Christendom and the natural
consequence must follow. Those who SOW the wind, must reap the whirl-
wind. It is in the natural order of things.
1 will allow that Liberty, Justice, Equality, Fraternity are the watchwords
of Young Turkey, but Young Turkey is only a small minority ; the great
majority of the Turkish nation are not Young Turks.
The question therefore resolves itself into this critical point: 'What will
Christendom do even now ?
