of blackened ruins, the stark walls of the churehes and liouses rising up out of the ashes and
charred timbers heaped on every side. What must it mean to the five thousand men and
women and little children who have survived a painful flight to the seacoast and have now
returned to their mountain home, only to find their houses sacked and burned ! There were
nine Christian villages which clustered about Kessab in the valleys below. Several of these
have been completely destroyed by tire. All have been plundered and the helpless people
driven out or slain.
Can you the feelings of the Kessab people as they climbed on foot the long trail
up the mountain, al
as they eame over the ridge into full view of their charred and
ruined dwellings ?
wheat, barley and rice had been burned ; clothing, cooking
utensils, furniture and
goats, cows and mules had been stolen ; their silk
industries stamped out

their friends and relat!

home is so strong that the

As these sheets are
ss there comes news of famine
at
Zeitoon. The Rev. F.
merican Missionary at Marash,
writes to the Rev. W. W. 1
Missionary at Constantinople, that
12,000 souls in and around 2
dying of hunger they are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran and
and cooking and eating it, if they can
get even that. Rev. Macullum
The same story comes to us from all
sides.
As
we
foresaw
all
along
fom now on the distress will be greatest."
If 50,000 were massacred the list of those who have died and are dying
of homelessness and starva on will exceed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerat d. Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no soymgs.
The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered in a night attack
by armed Kurds, and/the villagers are now reduced to extreme distress. Before
the outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeatedly appealed
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec-
tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It is
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
