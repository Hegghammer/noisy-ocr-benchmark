The Persians entertain much the same notions with regard to the
necessity for slenderness of form in the belles of their nation, but differ in
other matters from the Hindoos. The following illustration represents a
dancing-girl of Persia, and it will be seen that her figure bears no
indication of neglect of cultivation. It is somewhat curious that the
Chinese, with all their extraordinary ingenuity, have confined their
restrictive efforts to the feet of the ladies, leaving their waists unconfined.
That their doing so is more the result of long-established custom than
absence of admiration for elegantly-proportioned figures will be clearly
proved by the following extract from a letter published in Chambers'
Yournal, written by a genuine inhabitant of the Celestial Empire,
named Woo-tan-zhir tho paid a visit to England in 1844-45. Thus
he describes the ladies
agland -
"Their eyes, having
un tint of the waters of autumn, are
charming beyond descriptio
ir waists are laced as tight and thin
as a willow branch. What,
most was the
sight of elegantly.dracood
adies, with pearl-like necks and tight-
laced waists ; no
be so enchanting as to see ladies that
compress themselves
ns of the most exquisite shape, the

"
By many writers it has
that the admiration so generally
felt for slenderly-proportioned an
aists results from an artificial
taste set up by long custom:
Voo-tan-zhin's case it was
clearly not so, as the small-waisted
ladies of the "outer
barbarians" were to him much as some new
undescribed flowers or
birds would be to the wondering naturalist who
I
beheld them.
Although researches among the antiquities of Egypt and Thebes
fail to bring to our notice an article of dress corresponding with the
waist-bandage of Polenqui or the strophium of later times, we find
