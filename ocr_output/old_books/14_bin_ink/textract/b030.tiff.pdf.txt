CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

the skull, and capable only of very limited motion : the eye is almost uniformly mild, and the lips
unmoved by passion.

enjoyment among each other-they are : at least, we think there are motions in their features that
indicate affection, as well as fear, enquiry, surprise, gratitude, pleasurable wantonness, and some
other sentiments, or emotions. This is our conviction : at the same time, we perceive that the
range of their ferocions expression far exceeds the savage circle of their domestic charities. Are
not even the least of these observable in the habits and manners of the domestic Cat, who belongs
to the Tiger genera? But we have even seen a Tiger in his den, who looked grood-natured enough
to be stroked and patted : and of the Lion, of whom MR. GRIFFITH relates the following anecdote,
what can be said or thoughlt ?
" Hearing some noise under his cage, the Lion passed his paw between the bars, and actually
hauled up his keeper who was cleaning beneath ; but as soon as he perceived that he had thus ill
used his master, he instantly lay down upon his back in an attitude of complete submission."
Or what can be said of the circumstance mentioned by SENECA (of which he was personally
witness), of a Lion, to whom a man, who had formerly been his keeper, was exposed for destruction
in the amphitheatre at Rome and who was not only instantly recognised, but defended and
protected by the grateful beast ? - Or of the story related by DR. SOUTHEY, of the Lion who had
broken loose, submitting to the Cid, and allowing himself to be led back peaceably to his place of
confinement ?
