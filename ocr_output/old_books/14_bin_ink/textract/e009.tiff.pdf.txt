PREFACE
THE subject which we have here treated is a sort of figu
battle-field, where fierce contests have for ages been fr
waged; and, notwithstanding the determined
g
hosts, the contention and its cause
t the
commencement of the
heutral,
merely perfo
f," making
it our duty to gather tos
both ancient
P,
and modern, as may prove interesting
Lake note of the
vicissitudes of war, mark its various phases,
fine, to do our best
to lay clearly before our readers the histo
acts-experiences and
arguments-relating to the much-discusse
orset question."
As most of our readers are awar
leading journals especially
intended for the perusal of ladies ha
een for many years the media
for the exchange of a vast nun
of letters and papers touching
the use of the Corset. The destions relating to the history of
this apparently indispensable rticle of ladies' attire, its construction,
application, and influence on ne figure have become so numerous of late
that we have thought, by embodying all that we can glean and garner
relating to Corsets, their wearers, and the various costumes worn by
ladies at different periods, arranging the subject-matter in its due order
as to dates, and at the same time availing ourselves of careful illustration
when needed, that an interesting volume would result.
