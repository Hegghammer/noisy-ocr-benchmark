I will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and relate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
1796 after ruling over Armenia fifty-eight years.
He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his dominions, and
grew to be so mighty in battle that the neighbouring nations called his
country Aramia and the people were called Aramians, such names as
Armenia or Armenians being no doubt later corruptions.
The first victory of Aram was over Neuchar king of Media, whom he
took prisoner and put to death, and made a large part of the country of the
defeated prince tributary to his own. The second victory of Aram was over
Barsham king of Babylon, whom also he took prisoner and put to death.
The next victory was over the king of Cappadocia ; the army of the
Cappadocians was pursued to the very shores of the Mediterranean, and the
whole of Cappado la fell into the hands of Aram B.C. 1796. Also Ninus
king
of
Assyria,
at bne time an leager enemy, awed by the victories of Aram,
sought to cultivate is friendship.
No doubt if th
rolumes and scripts of paper or parchment of the famous
Alexandrian library

baths of the city, ha
scaped that most atrocious act of vandalism, and been
preserved instead,
treasures of knowledge now lost to us concerning
the ancient kingdont
Vestern Asia might be known in our day ; and also
when the tide of Is
rolled over the kingdom of Armenia, how
much of the story and
people was lost and destroyed along
with the destruction of th

or assert, but in taki
bowledge has been left
to us, there so
supposing that the "Aramceans"
designated
b
as "a people of Semitic race language and
religion from Northern Arabia and settling in the region between
the western boundaries of Babylonia and the highlands of Western Asia'
were no other than the Hai who under their King Aram had spread their
conquests and their kingdom into Mesopotamia and even to the shores of
the Mediterranean.
Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when he includes
Northern Mesopotamia, together with the mountainous country of Ararat,
under the name of Armenia, and in writing of the Armenian boats that
brought merchandise to Babylon, he remarks that they were constructed in
Armenia, in the parts above Assyria.
Archaeological researches have laid the claim that the modern Armenians
are the descendants of the old Hittites ; the modern Armenian being supposed
