PART I.
THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN.
Since the gathering of the
atentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and
till more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of th
wands without
its parallel in history.
In the Guildhall at
Coporable scene
witnessed in that city on
over has depicted
the proud array of repi
Mients of Europe,
but in the interests of P
Med to that painting
the wording of Article 61
Aten in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).
It was a curious irony
flough the taking of "the
terrible stronghold of Kars,' u
ted to be one of the greatest
and most difficult military explo
Heved, and the crowning success
of the Russian arms in Asiatic T
should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General; that altho
Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest, and Armenian soldiers fought, conquered and
died, yet by these successes not only was no amelioration attained of the
hard fate of their unhappy nation under Turkish rule, but that fate, hard
before, was made a hundredfold and even a thousandfold harder.
GENERAL FRINCE LOHIS MELIKOFF.
Commanded the Russian forces in Asiatic Turkey
during the Russo-Turkish war and captured the im-
pregnable fortress of Kars. Appointed Prime Minister
of Russia by Alexander II. The liberal policy which
characterized the reign of that excellent monarch, and
the Constitution that he was on the eve of granting to
his people were influenced by Melikoft; but after the
death of Alexander II he was not allowed to continue in
his good work of reforming Russia, being overthrown
from office early in the reign of Alexander III.
