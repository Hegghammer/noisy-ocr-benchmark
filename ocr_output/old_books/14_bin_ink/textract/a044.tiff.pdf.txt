THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
ARMENIAN PEOPLE.
During a period extending over thirty years the civilized world has
heard of Turkish Massacres of Armenians. Massacres of a nature so
ferocious and diabolical, so bideous and revolting, that no pen could adequate-

Writing in 1896, Mr. James Bryce, in his suppl
Intary chapter to the
4th edition of his book "Transcaucasia and Ara
