was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples which with sincere and deep feeling
honored
the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engage in
commerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase the value
of
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few ainong them justly started an agitation, these our noble
and industrious brethren were being massacred. What a terrible scene! When we
left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our Armenian compatriots being
removed
in manure carts legs and arms were hanging down outside. This bloody scene will
ever remain in. assed on my mind.
This shocki
me of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a cu
solutism, up to the last moment, grew wider. Even during the
past nine months of th
tution, in spite of the brotherly feelings which had been shown,
the awful events in Ad.
Lee and the souls of all true Osmanlis melted into tears.
Up to the present time th

choice morsels,

years. However much sacrifice we

happiness of the fatherland depends on
e as soon as possible.
We are convineed that the government an

ourselves. We must now wipe out the trad
the misfortune broug
a eursed period.
We must now comfort weeping hearts. We must understand and teach those who do not
understand that patriotism and brotherhood do not differ from each other. The responsibility
of the government for the Armenians is very great and very weighty. The whole Ottoman
nation is under obligations to proteet this suffering race, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
is in large part due to the blood shed by the Armenians. We thought that
these
truths
were so obvious that we preferred to keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary from time to time to recall the greatness of our obligation. We must
not
forget
that
this unhappy people up to yesterday has endured only barbarism, and for twelve years
has been constantly oppressed and ground to the earth, and has given thousands of victimis.
Hereafter we must work to assure them that the era of massaeres has passed, and with all our
strength of mind and soul we must quiet them. The obligation of the government to protect
them
is also very heavy, because our Armenian countrymen live among wandering tribes.
We must all assist the government and point out its obligation. It must be declared in
public and periodically that the one of the most important duties of the Ottoman nation
is
to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and property of
the
Armenians as well, since these are their sacred rights. Let investigations be made and
let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim."
This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare disclose
his identity ; and the account given by an authority like Mr. James Bryce
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as "les Massacres occasionnès par les aventuriers Arméniens."
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
