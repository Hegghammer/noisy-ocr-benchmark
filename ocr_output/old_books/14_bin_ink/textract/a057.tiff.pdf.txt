and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the feared fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history.
At the first meetifig of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruck to
learn
from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nereès, the Patriareh, their object being to request the signatory Powers of
the Berlin maty to foree a guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important ini ments a Armenia.

One summer afternoon a most

master. Concerning Vartan's whereabouts or his ultimate end nothing was ever made public
