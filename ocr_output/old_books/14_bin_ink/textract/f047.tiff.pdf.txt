And leaves both large and longe,

To hear the small birdes songe.
To se the dere draw to the dale,
And leve the hilles hee,
A
dow hem in the levës grene,
grene-wode tre.

cannot match :
The woodweele ung and wold not cease,
Sitting upon the spraye,
Soe lowde, he wakened Robin Hood,
In the greenwood where he lay.
It is versification of the simplest and the most
sincere kind.
Robin Hood, real or imaginary character, has
himself no criminal taint, but he is one of the
