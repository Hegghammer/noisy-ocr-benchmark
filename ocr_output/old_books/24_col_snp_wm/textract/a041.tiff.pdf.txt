like a round bow, a great brown eve revealed the inward spirit's intelligence aud zeal un-
quenched. On his head was a close-titting cap of purple velvet.
Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest men-Mgrditch
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armeuian people-slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery ealled Etchmiatzin, or " The Ouly-Begotten
is
Descended.' From the window of a neighboring room he might have looked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now all eut close and huried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling suow and hurricane that hid the
cone of Ararat. And jitst beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of that lake, eighty-seyen years ago, Khrimian was horm. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminisher by sea or land the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom-a
reputation which still rather pathetically survires throughout the Near East. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos now looked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to last it had been in-pired by one absorbing and unselfish aim-the freedom and
regencration of his people. It is tric he had failed.
From his carliest years, when he had witnessed the terrors of Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality-such a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance ationg the
prosperous and contented of the world. He began as a poet, wandering far and wide through
the Turkish, Persian, and Rissian sections of Arnienia, visiting Constantinople and Jernsalen,
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wile's death, he devoted himself to the building of sehools,
which he generously threw open to Kards, the hereditary assassins of Irmenians. For many
years, while Europe was occupied with Crimcan wars, Austrian wars, or French and Germau
wars, we see him ceaselessly jourueying from Van to Constantinople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though contiunally defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emblems of the Host hung in mockery romd the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenian patriarch of Constantinople (1869), he was driven from
his oflice after four years.
But the eup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiless slangliter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than eren the European Powers could stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian fonnd
himself summoned to plead his people's cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Europe
beforchand, urging them to create :111 autonomous nentral state for Armenia, as they had
done with succes for the Lebanon. In Lontlon he became acquainted with Gladstone but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which hail kindled the lieart of Eugland, and,
in the Congress itself Khrinian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey's definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London amid shouts of Peace with Honor,'
and Armenia was left to stew.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Chureli and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armeniaus were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake
