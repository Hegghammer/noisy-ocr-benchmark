Van, and the lowest estimate counted the murdered deal nt 100,000. Gladstone made the
last great speech of his heroie life. England attempted some kind of protest. But rather
than join the Liberal demand for action, Lord Rosebery left his party for private leisure, and
Russia, France, and Germany combined to secure immunity for the Ggreat assassin." It
was the lowest point of Europe's shame.
Blow folloired blow. Hardly had the remmant of the Armenian people escaped from
massacre when their Church fell under the bratal domination of Russia. Plehve ordained its
destruction, and Golitzin was sent to Tiflis as governor-genera to carry it out. Church
property to the value of £1,000,000 was seized by violenee, the Katholikos resolutely refusing
to give IIP the kers of the safe where the title deeds were kept (June, 1903). For two years
the Russiau officials played with the revenues, retaining eiglity per cent. for their own
But in the mean time assassination had rid the earth of Plehve, and the over-
whehning defents of Russia in Manehuria were attributed to the Armenian eurse. Grudgingly
the Church property was restored, in utter chacs, and for the moment it is Russin's policy to
favor the Armentans as a balance against the Georgians, whom the St. Petersbarg government
is now deternimed to destroy.
Sueh was the past upon which the worn old mau, stretehed on his monastic bed, looked
back that winter's morning. Singleness of aim has its reward in spiritual peace, but of the
future he was not hopeful. Ile no longer ever conteuplated an autonomoas Armenia, either
on Turkish territory or on Russian. On the Russian side of the frontier the Armenian
villages were too scattered, too much interspersed with Georgians and Tartars, to allow
of autonomy. On the Turkish side, he thought, massacre and exile had now left too few of
the race to form any kind of community. Indeed, for the last twelve years the Armenian
villagers have been crawling over the foot of Ararat by thousands a year to escape the Kurds,
and every morning they conie and thud III fre-h groups of pink and blue rags outside the
monastery door where the head of their Chureh and race lies dring. They stand there in
mute appeal, as I them. possessing nothing in the world but the variegated tatters
that cover them, and their faith in their Katholikos. Slowly they are drafted

Some of the bishops and monks, who form a council round their elrief, still look for
Europe's interference, and trust that the solemn pledges taken by Eugland and other Powers
at Berlin may be fulfilled. The Bishop of Erivan, for instance, still Inbors for the appoint-
ment of a Christian governor over the district marked by the ill-omened names of Van, Bitlis,
and Erzernam. I also found that even among the Georgians there was a large party willing
to concede all the frontier district from Eriyan to Kars, where Armenian villages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Cancasus wins federal
autonomy, But the majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and industries. One cannot vet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolutionary parties of The Bell and The Flag.' Of
these,
the Social Democratic Bell' follows the usnal impracticable and pedantie creed of St. Marx.
The " Flag," or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a

nesembly held in Erivan last August (1906) they adopted a programme of land nationalization,
universal sutfrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected laymen. If the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.
Whatever nay be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
