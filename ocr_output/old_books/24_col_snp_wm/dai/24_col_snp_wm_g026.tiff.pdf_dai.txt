HISTORICAL SKETCHES OF
friars, and other spiritual teachers. Puerta d'
Anchusi was selected as the place of the projected
settlement, the base from which the cross and
the sword were to advance to their respective
conquests.
Accordingly, on the fourteenth day of August,
1559, de Luna's fleet cast anchor vithin the
harbor, which he named Santa Maria; the same
year in which the monarch who authorized the
expedition died, the month and nearly the day
on which he, a living racu, was engaged in the
paradoxical farce of participating in his own
funeral ceremonies in the monastery of Yust√©.
The population of two thousand souls, which
the fleet brought, with the required supplies of
every kind, having been landed, the work of
settlement began. Of the place where the settle-
ment was made there exists no historic informa-
tion, and we are left to the inference that the
local advantages which afterwards induced d'
Arriola to select what is now called Barrancas
as the site of his town, governed the selection of
de Luna's, unless tradition enables us to identify
the spot, as a future page will endeavor to do.
