Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influcnces of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this uper-added evil, is, the
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians Freater marauders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupaty
of whose lives comprises
murder and robbery, and who have through WV
centuries unremittingly
quartered themselves upon the industrious chri
beasants, and lived on
the fruits of their labour and toil. Indeed as
amidiel cavalry which
was established expressly for the Hamidia
cres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of specy
it outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized murder
find for those habits in
which they were encouraged and tra
ulge by the Hamidian
régime.
Under all such conditions no hop
S can be forthcoming,
no prospect of better times seems po
unhappy portion of the
Armenian race whom force of
c
bs on the soil of the
fatherland.
The appointment of Chri
overn
er the provinces in-
habited by them might ameliora
.e of the
r the other alternative,
of allowing the use of an
all alike,
pective of creed or
nationality, would furnish S
means of self-d oce against the raids
and barbarities of the oppre
; but even if such C& cessions were granted,
life for the christian peasar
bject to Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his enemies, must rein
one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, an fences of the worst nature. Not the most fertile
soil, not the most fa rable climatic conditions, not the most assiduous
industry, not the most Deace loving, law abiding instincts, can bring to the
Armenian peasant der Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
happiness, and security of life and property, which the law of all civilized
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil.
