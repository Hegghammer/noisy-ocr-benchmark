On the field the evervictorious army of little Japan undermined Russia's
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
deleated and ever retreating army of colossal Russia. At sea the ever
victorious Japanese Fleet succeeded in completely annihilating the Russian
Fleet. It was war such as the world had never yet seen. The secret of
such astounding successes should be investigated, and here I beg leave to
quote from one of a series of articles in which I gave view to my opmions
during the Russo-Japenese War. "Japan may be likened to the b

faggots in the fable firmly tied together; one faggot of larger din

National Unity is our greatest nee

mountains of difficulties before us, and

can only do so by being bound together

fable, with no weakening or loosening
the bands. Then perhaps we
might once more be able to get an indep indent footing on the historical soil
of our fathers, and perhaps once more fally round our own flag. A Japan-

but let us live for our communities whilst we keep the hope in our hearts
that communities grow into States.
We have grit and endurance in an unparalleled degree, but these
characteristics will profit us nothing it we are wanting in unity.
Let us remember that utterance of the Founder of our faith. In our
loyalty and allegiance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents of a
cataract, but we must remember His warning utterance -
What shall it profit a man." What shall it profit a nation. Unity is
the soul of a nation. Let us keep our soul and not lose it.
