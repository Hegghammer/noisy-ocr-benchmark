THE STORY OF EEAN THE FISHERMAN'S SON
"Your third dream," said the ancient dwarf,
"was the Dream of the Arrows."
"It is even so," said the King. "I dreamed
of arrows that were shot upward to a great height."
And then the King was silent, and he and the
dwarf looked long upon Zabulun the Enchanter.
But Zabulun took a step nearer to them, and he
said :
"In the lore of the Chaldeans, arrows shot up-
ward signify a very high tower. I can tell you
now the significance of your three dreams, O King.
They are of a treasure that is to come into your
possession. The treasure is hidden. It is hidden
beneath a tower. The height to which the arrows
were shot shows that the treasure is hidden under
the highest of towers - under the Tower of Baby-
lon."
