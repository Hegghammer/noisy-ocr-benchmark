THE ZONE
Avert Thy gaze, O God, close tight Thine eyes!
Glance down no longer on the ocean foam,
Lest Thou behold such horrors as can turn
Men's burning hearts to ice, and chill their souls.
Keep Thine heart warm and full of charity
That Thou mayst yet be able to forgive,
And pity feel for those who know not when
To pause in deeds of ruthless sacrifice.
Restrain Thy wrath, and keep
hand in
check;
Smite not, nor fiercely thrust wit
Those who can dare to strew th
With fellow creatures, innocen
Forget the studied purpose
The launching of the miss
the deep;
Theshattered hull; the cr
bleeding forms;
The seething swirl of W
women, men.
