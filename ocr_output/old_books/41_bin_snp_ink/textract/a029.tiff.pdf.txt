TREATY OF BERILIN.
Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in ISTS, and the signing of the still more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel in history.

GENERAL PRINCE
MELIKOFF
Commanded the Russian forces in Asiatic Turkey
during the Russo-Turkish war and captured the im-
pregnable fortress of Kars. Appointed Prime Minister
of Russia by Alexander II. The liberal policy which
characterized the reign of that excellent monarchi, and
the Constitution that he was on the ove of granting to
his people were influenced by Melikoft: but after the
death of Alexander II lie was not allowed to continue in
his good work of reforming Russia, being overthrown
from office early in the reign of Alexander III.
