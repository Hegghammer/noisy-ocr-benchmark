smell of corpses is in the air, the odor from the carcases of the "christian

blood, and rests to couch for a future spring. We have seen that sort of an
end to the tragedy of a tiger's victim the tiger has eaten his fill, he rests,
to keep guard over the crunched hones and mangled bits of bloody flesh that
bestrew the earth. So also no her is a residue left of those that have
