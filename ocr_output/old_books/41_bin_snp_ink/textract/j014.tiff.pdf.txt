the last space will be a short 1/2 in. or whatever dimension is used.
In such cases it is necessary to redivide the last several spaces into

With a 3/16 in. wood bit bore holes thru the rails and stiles at

holes, and in other ways. In shops where
power machinery is available a vertical borer
may be used for this purpose. It is best to
carefully mark the points for boring with a center punch

of line will be reduced to a minimum. The dimer

The Seven Steps in Caning.-Fig. 4 shows the se

The numbers on the photograph refer to the steps.
Step 1. A hank of cane should be soaked for a few minutes in
warm water, or longer in cold. Do not soak it too long. Start a
