was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples which with sincere and deep feeling
honored
the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armentan. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engage
in
commerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase the value
of
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few among them justly started an agitation, these our noble
and industrions brethren were being massacred. What a terrible scene! When wr
left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our Armenian compatriots being
removed in manire carts; legs and arins were hanging down outside. This bloody seene will
ever remain impressed on ny mind.
"
This shocking crime of Yildiz formed a (leep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a cursed absolutism, up to the last moment, grew wider. Even during the
past
nine
months
of
the
Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feelings which had been shown,
the
awful
events
in
Adail
took place and the souls of all true Osmanlis melted into tears.
Up
to
the present time th deep sorrow caused by this event has not disappeared, because this
bloody wound in our socia body eannot easily be cured. While we fill our stonmehs with
choice morsels, while we r
t selfishly in our comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans, widows hungry,
1 ked, and barofoot wander lither and thither, and thousands of
families are fleeing from ti
fatherland. We are o vinced that the government is doing its
work, but what has happer
is
so
great
a
calar
that it can keep a government busy for
years. However much si
ce we may
still it will be inadequate, because the
happiness of the fatherland
nds on lies
such blood wounds as these as soon as possible.
We are convineed that the
ment a
connected with it are persuaded of this as well as
onrselves. We must now Il
the misfortune brought by a eursed period.
We must now comfort weep
must understand and teach those who do not
understand that patriotism
do not differ from each other. The responsibility
of the government for the
very great and very weighty. The whole Ottoman
nation is under obligation
this suffering race, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
is in large part due to
shed by the Armenians. We thought that these truths
were so obvious that
to keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary from ti
recall the greatness of our obligation. We must not forget
that this onhar
up to yesterday has endured only barbarismi, and for twelve years
has been con
oppressed and ground to the earth, and has given thousands of victinis.
Hereafter
ive must work to assure them that the era of inassacres has passed, and with all our
strength of mind and soul we must quiet them. The obligation of the government to protect
them
is
also very heavy, becanse our Armenian conntrymen live among wandering tribes.
We must all assist the government and point out its obligation. It must be declared in
public and periodically that the one of the most important duties of the Ottoman nation
is
to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and property of
the
Armenians as nvell, since these are their sacred rights, Let investigations be munde and
let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim."
This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare disclose
his identity ; and the account given by an authority like Mr. James Bryce
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as "les Massacres occasionnès par les aventuriers Arméniens."
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
