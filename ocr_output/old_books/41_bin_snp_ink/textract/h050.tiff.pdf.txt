life, rendered him a nost valuable acquisition to the community in
which he carried on his business, and the articles he manufactured
were of sterling value to the farming interests of the country.
Mr. Horton, on sending me his photograph for an engraving,
accompanied it with the following very modest and unassuming sketch
of his life :
"I was born in Yorktown, Westch er County, New York, 15
September, 1806. My parents were
ners, in moderate circum-
stances, I remained with them until T

Mr. Horton is not a public professor of Christianity, but is a gen-
tleman of correct moral deportment, and very temperate in his habits.
