Further in answer to Ahmed Riza Bey's account of the Armenian
'prétendus patriotards" in connection with the Ottoman Bank ; I cannot do
better than quote from Mr. Bryce's version of the story, and the massacre
that followed : " In the following June serious
ble arose at Van, where
some sort of insurrection is said to have b
ed, though in the discre-
pancy of the accounts it is hard to
Iruth. Masses of Kurds
came down threatening to mase
, and a conflict in which
many innocent persons perishe
y brought to an end by
the intervention of the British C.
er the Armenian revolu-
tionary party, emboldened by the
there the Christians, being
well armed and outnumbering the
A
their ground successfully,
issued appeals to the Embassies and to
Government to introduce
reforms, threatening disturbances if the
repression and massacre
was persisted in. These threats were re
n August, and ultimately,
on August 26, a band of about twenty Armen
pelonging the revolutionary
party, made a sudden attack on the Imperi
ttoman Bank in Constan-
tinopie, declaring they were prepared to hol
and blow it up should the
Sultan refuse their demand. They captured
building by a coup de main,
but were persuaded by the Russian dragom
withdraw upon a promise
of safety. Meanwhile the Government, who
oh their spies knew of the
project, had organised and armed a large me
Kurds and Lazes-many
of whom had recently been brought to the d
gether with the lowest
Turkish class. Using the occasion, they laun

ous parts of the city so
soon after the attack on the Bank that it had
V
been prearranged,
and the precaution had been taken to employ t
n ruffians in different
quarters from those in which they dwelt : so t
might less easily be
recognised. Carts had moreover been prepa
which to carry off the
dead. For two days an indiscriminate slaught

Armenian merchants and traders of the cultiva a class, not only the indus-
trious and peaceable Armeniaus of the humblel class, clerks, domestic ser-
vants, porters employed on the quays and in the warehouses, but also women
and children were butchiered in the streets and hunted down all through the
suburbs. On the afternoon of the 27 th the British Chargé d'Affaires (whose
action throughout won general approval) told the Sultan he would land
British sailors, and the Ambassadors telegraphed to the Sultan. Then the
general massacre was stopped, though sporadic slaughter went on round the
city during the next few days. The Ambassadors, who did not hesitate
to declare that the massacre had been organised by the Government;
estimated the number of killed at from 6000 to 7000 the official report
