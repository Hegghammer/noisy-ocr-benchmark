PREFACE
On the analogy of the famous apple,-"there ain't
going to be no" preface, "not nohow." Children do
not read prefaces, so anything of a prefatory nature
that might interest them is put at the beginning of chap-
ter one.
As for the grown-ups
e story is not written for grown-
ups, and if they want t
OW why it begins with such a
gruesome first chapter,
m ask the children. Chil-
dren like the horrors firs
e end all bright. Many
grown-ups like the traged
nd. But perhaps the
children are right and th
S are standing on
their heads. Besides they
irst chapter; it is
only a prologue.
