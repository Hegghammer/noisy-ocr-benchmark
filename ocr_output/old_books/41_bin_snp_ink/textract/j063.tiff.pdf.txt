REED AND SPLINT WEAVING

mable, and should be used in a room in which there is free circula-
tion of air. If colors have been mixed properly and thinned to the
right consistency, the reed will dry rapidly and the color will be
sharp and clear, free from muddy effects.
A woven article such as a basket or woven top footstool may be
dipped, or the color poured over and allowed to drip dry. In some
instances it is good policy to wipe surplus stain off lightly. Then,
in the case of the footstool or similar project, if the worker so
desires he may stain the wood a darker shade than the top with a
prepared stain. Reed is very effective without stain; many of the
stools shown herewith are left natural. Reed may be shellacked or
varnished. Because of its porosity it soils very easily unless some
finishing agent is used, and a good grade of elastic varnish is recom-
mended as a finish, especially when the woven article is subject to
severe use.
Other Materials.-Re is not the only good medium adapted
to weaving, either in correlation with wood or when used alone.
On the stools illustrated several other materials have been used,
as inner hickory bark and Indian splints and fiber. Binding cane,
rope, and even willow may be utilized with success. Paper fiber
was discussed in detail in Chapter V and needs

Sufficient to say that this fiber adapts
all work where reed is commonly employed, and
is, commercially, supplanting reed.
Inner hickory bark may be

cational value of weaving. In the spring or

on either side of the shaved strip; then beginning at one end peel
