and Russia, and preparations were being hade for the Berlin Congress, it was lie who, in
spite of the feared fanatical aprising of the Turks, threw prudenee to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history.
At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nercès, the Patriareh, their object lieing to request the signatory Powers of
the Berlin Trenty to force A guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.

to dine with him informal
this kind could not very well be refused, so
the Archbishop, accompanie
fervant named Vartan, repaired to the Pasha's
house. The Pasha received II

extreme courtesy to a private
