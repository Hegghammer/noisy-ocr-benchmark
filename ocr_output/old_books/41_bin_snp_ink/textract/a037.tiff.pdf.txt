No one doubts that a great forward movement is reaching its culminat-
ing point in the destiny of Asia. The West has learnt its all of religion (the
moral and guiding principle of mankind) from the East, and now the East
would fain learn the law of restraint and the law of freedom (the protecting
principles of mankind) from the West. Inspired by this feeling the liberal
Turks decidedly ni
well, and they are animated with a sincere desire to
ensure peace and se
f life and property for the heterogeneous peoples
under the Turkish ST
ev themselves have had to contend and still
have to contend with a
ace.
To the Mahommeda
Caliph of Islam is the envoy of
God, the sacredness of wh
plate. Abdul Hamid, the
astute politician, knew that
nty depended on his
Caliphal rights, and his main
of his execrable
reign had been directed towa
the same; thus
we can see how his dethronement
uld gladly have
accomplished simultaneously with
onstitution, had
to be deferred to a later period, an
or the She k ul
Islam to pronounce the Caliph a traite
crt
violator of the
holy law of the Prophet, before his
emer
be dared or
accomplished.
The Christian Armenians in Turkey
the m
f the followers
of a hostile religion, with no power or forc
ind then
nich makes for
protection. Who does not know that the grea omerical ponderance of
Hinduism keeps the balance of power in India, a restrains pody religious
hostilities; and when we review the whole ren lous history of Christian
Europe, and that terribly long roll of crimes committed in the name of 11im
who expounded His religion with the parable of the Good Samaritan, and
the precept of loving one's neighbour as one's self, we cannot feel surprise at
the fanatical outbursts of the followers of Mahommed, the founder of a
religion whose doctrines certainly fall short of the humane principles
inculcated by the Founder of Christianity. If authentic historical facts prove
to us that horrible and atrocious cruelties have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other religionists, but on fellow Christians of different
denominations, how then can we expect better things from the Turk unless
some power or force restrain him ?
Christianity has now partly emancipated herself from the ferocities
which darkened and poured the red stream of blood on her white banner
:
but to the Mahommedan world at large, religiou is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite.
