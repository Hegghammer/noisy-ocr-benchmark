PREFACE
from Smith, who himself was prone to include
the most extracagant myths in his pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE Lives AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAMOUS
HIGIWAYMEN. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the "truth" of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.
No wone has ever reprinted those wuthors in
their 01
il extravagance, or their grossness.
It would
ssible ; and, if possible, it would
not be ente.
Vor has any one ever edited
them, or et
independent history of
the highwaym
der how astonish-
ingly popular
ever been
which have hat
d Turpin,
and their like
not a little
surprising.
Perhaps the tas
bandoned because
of the difliculty-the st insuperable difficulty
of sifting fact frot fiction, and because of a
chilling sense that it would be a thankless task
to present the highwayman us he really was : a
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No novelist would
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dis-
service, and I do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
