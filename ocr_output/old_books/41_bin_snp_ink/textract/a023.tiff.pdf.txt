orgy, except to call them fiends incarnate ; and who is the bold man who
can guarantee that these same fiends incarnate have become metamorphosed
and changed all of a sudden ; or that the handful of liberal Turks at Con-
stantinople are capable of controlling and restraining them. We have not
even heard that the leaders and participators of the last massacres have
been punished as they deserved; and whatis the reason they are left un-
punished ? because the Government is afr to punish Mahommedans for
killing Christians; because the liberal
dare not punish the true
believers' for killing "Kaffirs."
The religion of Mahommed, the
word, has been infused
into the Turk, and to understand the
ligion of Mahommed
upon the Turk, it is necessary to re
pects, or from four
points of analysis. First, the funda
V

Second, the character of the found

In conclusion, I will niy readers to compare one point of difference
between the tivo races, me oppressor and the oppressed. Thousands upon
thousands of Armenian women, thousands upon thousands of Armenian
children, have been hounded to death, or savagely, ferociously, horribly and
loathsomely maltreated by the Turk, and yet in all the agonizing years when
Massacre has succeeded upon Massacre, has there been one known case or
one single instance of a Turkish wcman or child maltreated by Armenians ?
The last massacres though especially organized from the Palace at
Constantinople, were officially announced to originate from an affray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed one of the three :
given equal numbers and arms, the Armenian is always a match for the
Turk, but alas for him that unequal numbers and want of arms have always
made him the victim of his oppressor.
Ahmed Riza Bey in the first part (Ses Causes) of his book "La Crise de
L'Orient published in Paris in 1907 holds a brief for his nation which

passage as an example.
