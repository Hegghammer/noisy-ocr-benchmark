CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
3
Every artist does best, that which he is best qualified and best disposed to do. In com-
pleting the
that has been found necessary for the Work, Mr. EDWIN LANDSEER
has chosen to
F
different principle. He has grone, without
any introductory nee
exhibited the sayage manners and
habits of these quadrupeds
oservations.
On the distinction betw
SSION, we shall now deliver our opinion.
By the Character of an anii
dranencies of his look and features which he
always offers to view when
esioned state : by his Expression, the variations
of muscular action superindu
which he is liable, as the storms of passion sweep
by, and his mind becomes ag
thal circumstances acting on the ardours of his instinct.
The former, seems to h
bex in the solid and massy parts : the latter, agitates, oft-
times rebelliously, the nerve
huscles. Character is ever present, both in the animal coun-
tenance, and in the huma
divine." The most violent expression does not proscribe, or
obliterate, character. Indiviodality consists of it, as far as concerns external appearance ; and it
forms the system of vowels of the language of Nature, without which no Expression could be.
Whoever regards the faces of a flock of Sheep, will see in them an infinite variety of Character,
with very little Expression, and that little without diversity : and if we descend a step lower in
the scale of being, and contemplate the finny tribe, where Character is not wanting, we find no
Expression at all. Even Trees and inanimate objects, possess Character. We recollect a poetical
friend of ours, now in Italy, saying that every tree and every rock had a face-but of this we are
not so certain though very certain, that there is enough of Character in rocks and trees, to make
a poet think so.
Character and Expression, in the carnivorous class of animals, to which we here solicit
attention, are always co-existent - their proportions varying with the existing occasions-in
pictorial exhibitions of such subjects.
No. II.
THERE is much Character, and little Expression, in the reposing Leopard with his sheathed
claws, which is shewn in the present engraying, copied by Mr. SPILSBURY from RIDINGER, and
corrected from Nature. RIDINGER was an artist of great power, who studied wild animals in
their sequestered haunts, as is shewn in his grand forest back-grounds; and who, grenerally
speaking, left little or no room for others to improve, except on some few of his inferiór works.
The present is an interesting and beautiful animal, yet there is a latent capability of mischief
characterised in his countenance, and we might ask, in the language of Job, " Who shall dare to
rouse him up ?"
