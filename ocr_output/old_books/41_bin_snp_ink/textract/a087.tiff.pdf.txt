Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have clung to their christian faith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure.
The cathedral of Etchmiatzin built by Gregory still stands to-day it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, until perhaps
little of the original building may be left, but it still claims to be the church
built by the patron saint of Armenia. I shall here quote a passage fom
"Historical Sketch of the Armenian Church," written by an
menian
priest :

I read the other day in one of the foreign papers published in Japan,
the following piece of news :
"An Armenian Church pronounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christian era, has been discovered in a fair state of preserva-
tion in the neighbourhood of Bash-Aparnah,"
Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light on Armenian history.
