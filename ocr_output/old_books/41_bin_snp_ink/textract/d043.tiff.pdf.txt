type and she would have puzzled the psychol-
ogist to classify. She was so many sided as to
be in a class by herself. She had plenty of common
sense and intelligenee for her years and an outlook
essentially fair minded and just. But she also had a
quiet hauteur, curiously coupled with humility, and at

cosu ner power for her
own benefit. Further, her humble estimate of her own
capacity for judgment caused her but rarely to exercise
the power at all. In practice it was almost confined
to those cases where a sweet minded child's natural in-
stinet for fair play sees further than the sophistries of
the adult.
She was practically unaware of this power, which
was destined to bring her into conflict with Eleanor
Mowbray nor did she take the least delight, as she might
easily have done, in exercising power for power's sake.
