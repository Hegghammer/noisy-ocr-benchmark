PREFACE
ix
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific his-
torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and exalted the villains, for whom of old no
mud was too thich and slab. Beliefs are being
assailed on every side. To abolish the traditional
courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the considerate
conduct of Captain Hind would, therefore, be
strokes of the unkindest, and I have here attempted
no such iconoclusm. Even where I cannot be-
lieve, I have told the tale-wchenever it has been
worth the telling-as it is found in criminal
triuls, or in Smith or Johnson, and other old
sources, decorously stripped of much vile language.
For realt
that seems incredible
may be fur
the believable
turns tw
S your only way.
To continue
c highwaymen from
Smith and Johnison
anroaching end
of all such things in
of the nine-
teenth century, is like taking up and concluding
a half-told tale. But it was worth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpin has
always maile, has it been found really necessary
to seriously consider and re-state the carcer of
that nuch-overrated scoundrel, and to put him
in his proper place : a very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
