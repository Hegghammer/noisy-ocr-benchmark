THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
ARMENIAN PEOPLE.
During a period extending over thirty years the civilized world has
heard of Turkish Massacres of Armenians. Massacres of a nature so
ferocious and diabolical, so hideous and revolting, that no pen could adequate-
ly describe their horrors
Writing in 1896, Mr. James Bryce, in his supplementary chapter to the
4th edition of his book Transcaucasia and Ararat' make the following
grave comment 1
" Twenty years is a short space in the life
nation. But these
twenty years have been filled with sufferings
Armenian Christians
greater than their ancestors had to
00, the eight centuries that
have passed since the first Turkish Co
Armenia. They have been
years of misery, slaughter, martyrdor
y, despair.'
And the years that have follow

sense only, for of all civilized
on earth, Armenians are politically one
of the most forlorn, but the CO
has not been wiped off the map. It still
occupies the geographical place
is held since history has been written.
The land of the Euphrates and ris, that Araxes valley, where, as simple
and primitive Armenians will to this day assert in unshaken belief, God made
man in His own image, and the country round the base of Ararat, where the
generations of men once more began to people the earth.
Once the land of Ararat was an independent kingdom until the tide of
victory rolled over it and conquered its independence. Hemmed round
by
three Great Empires, Russian, Turkish and Persian, the unfortunate geo-
graphical position of the country became the cause of its people's ruin.
It is of bitter interest to Armenians to know that Ararat is the point
where the three Empires, Russian, Turkish and Persian, meet, whilst the
