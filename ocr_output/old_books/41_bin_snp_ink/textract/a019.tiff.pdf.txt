INTRODUTION
TO 2ND PRINTING.
My object in writing this little book is to lay the hard case of my un-
fortunate race before the men and women of the United States. ; sinnt it
is
from the United States that the American Missionaries have gone th, who

the sulphur flames of religious fanaticism burst, the lava floods of race hatred
and lust of plunder, break forth and run in fiery streams the unfortunate
victims are pounced upon, swooped upon, pillaged, plundered, butchered,
slaughtered, subjected to outrages SO hideous, cruel, loathsome, and revolt-
ing, that no pen could depict their horrible realities and the details can never
go into print. The human mind is staggered and asks itself the question if
even the imaginations of fiends and devils could originate such horrors.
Then this orgy of the hnman fiends is arrested. For the time being the
