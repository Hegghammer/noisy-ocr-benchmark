of blackened ruins, the stark walls of the churelies and liouses rising ap ont of the ashes and
charred timbers heaped on every side. What must it mean to the five thousand men and
women and little children who have survived a painful flight to the sencoast and have now
returned to their nountain home, only to find their houses sacked and burned ! There were
mine Christian villages which clustered about Kessab in the valleys below. Several
of
these
have been completely destroyed by tire. AH have been plundered and the helpless poople
driven out or slain.'
Can you imagine the feelings of the Kossab people as they climbed on foot the long trail
up the mointain, and thien as they came over the ridge into foll view of their charred and
ruined
dwellings ? Their stores of whent, barley and rice had been burned ; clothing, cooking
utensils, furniture and tools had gone; their goats, COWS and mules had been stolen their silk
industries stamped out; their beloved churches reduced to smouldering heaps. The bodies
of
their friends and relatives who had been killed had not been buried. And yet the love of
home is so strong that the people have settled dlown there with the deternination to clear up
the debris and rehuild their houses." -Extracts from The Back of Kessab,' Stephen Van R.

As these sheets are going through the p ess there
of famine
at
Zeitoon. The Rev. F. W. Macullum,
ary at Marash,
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet, American
Constantinople, that
12,000 souls in and around Zeitoon are
ger; they are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran and water
in and eating it, if they can
get even that. Rev. Macullum add
same story comes to us from all
sides. As we foresaw all along,
OW on the distress will be greatest.
If 50,000 were massacred
nist of those who have died and are dying
of homelessness and starval
will exceed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerate
Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no SOWI
p.
The latest news is th Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolation O the massacres, has been plundered in a night attack
by armed Kurds, and the fillagers are now reduced to extreme distress. Before
the outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeatedly appealed
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec-
tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It is
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
