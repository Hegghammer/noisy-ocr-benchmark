CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
No. III.
Two COUCHANT LIONS, AFTER RUBENS, taken from his celebrated picture before alluded
to, of the Prophet Daniel incarcerated in the den. The Lions are here supposed to be miraculously
held in a state of tranquillity. Here, too, is not much Expression, but an extraordinary grandeur
of Character, suited to the greatness of an occasion where the Deity himself especially interferes
to seal up the voracious energies of the most terrible of his creatures, in calm submission. There
is a
ob
of royal dignity mingled with this submission, which is very impressive, and even
subm
The
ems this to be a successful restoration of the Nature that was wanting in the
prints of this S
hich has often been engraved by PICART and others,) after RUBENS. The
original pieture
n our ill-fortune never to lave seen. The shaggy manes, and the latent
terror that sits
broned in the open eyes of the superior Lion-suited to the darkness of
the den, and th
is animal's sense of vision,-are as well thoughh of, as they are
executed ; and à
uch address from the closed eyes of the couching Lion beyond,
of which also the cha
t happily marked. A powerful and divine spell possesses
them both.
O. IV.
The TIGER WHICH MARO
ESSION, without an object before him to call
forth emotion, possesses a calm character, combined with the resistless strength of that dreadful
quadruped ; whose very tranquillity, in his leisure sauntering, when no excitement is acting on his
nerves, lias an appalling effect. - His brow is clouded, though his claws are sheathed. There is a
possibility of a dreadful storm which may not be far distant, and that is eloogh to stamp the
Tiger's character. None shall dare to arouse his energies, hor to encounter them when aroused.
No. V.
This GROUP OF PLAYFUL LEOPARDS, AFTER RUBENS, must be supposed to belong to the
jocund train of Bacchus, since they are luxuriating at their ease, among grapes and vine branches.
These Leopards are doubtless intended to have a degree of playful expression-induce perhaps by
the exhilarating juice of the grape : and we should "guess" (as Jonathun says) that this group
was studied from a litter of half-grown kittens. Few, however, except the sailors who were
accustomed to grambol with the Tiger-cub on board the Pitt East-Indiaman, would like to venture
to frolic with them.
