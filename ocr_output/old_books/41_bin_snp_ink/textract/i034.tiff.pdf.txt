THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
raised by a small swell of the ocean and I
was impressed by the nearness of the davit
by getting a blow on the back which nearly
knocked me overboard.
Then I admit that I saw the hopeless-
ness of ever clearing the for'ard davit in time
to get the boat away, so I stepped out and
made a try for it by swimming. I spoke to
several and urged them to come; but truly
they were petrified, and only my training
from boyhood up, in the water and underi it,
gave me the courage to jump. I swam about
100 feet away from the ship and then turned
around to see if anyone was following
t
whom I could lend a hand, and found seve
who needed encouragement. Also I W
to see when the final plunge of the
er
came, that I might be the more
to
fight against the vortex and t
thers.
The Lusitania did not go
thing
like head first: she had, rath
