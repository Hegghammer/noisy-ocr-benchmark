THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
I mean those in the staterooms. I cannot
speak with certainty in regard to the port-
holes on deck E. I believe that the first list
the ship took brought her down to these
open ports on the starboard side and that
she sank much more quickly from filling
through them.
On my return to the deck I felt that the
steamer must make her final plunge any mo-
ment now, and as there wes nothing more that
could be done on the port ide-for there was
no discipline or order with hich to do it-I
passed through to the starb
d side.
Men
were striving to lower the
is and were
putting women and children in
em, but it
seemed to me that it only ao
orror to
the whole situation to put p
into a
boat that you knew never would
leared
and which would go down with tl
teamer;
better leave them on the deck to
t them
take their chance at a piece of wrec. ge.
