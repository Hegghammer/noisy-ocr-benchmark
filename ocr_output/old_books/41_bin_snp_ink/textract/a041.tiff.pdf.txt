Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest men-Morditch
Khrimian,
Katholikos of the Armeniau Charch, and soul of the Armenian people-slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or The Only-Begotten
is Descended.' From the window of a neighboring 10011 hr might have looked across the
frost
bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now all eut close and huried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling snow and hurricane that hid the
cone of Ararat. And jnst beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Delage, On the
shore of that lake, eighty- sen years ago, Khrimian tras born. In 1820 the Turkisli
Empire was still undiminishe

tyranny, and establishred for E.

reputation still ratlier pa

Entering the monastic order after his wife's de

which he generously threw open to Kurds, the
litary assassins of Armenians. For many
years, while Europe was occupied with Crimca
S, Austrian wars, or French and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying fron

cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though
innally defeated, his schools burned, his

But the eup of Turkish iniquity was filling. TI pitiless shaugliter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Pon X could-stand.
With
varied
motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls Of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to plead his people's cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though lie
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Europe
beforehand, urging them to create an autonomous nentral state for Armenia, as they had
done with success for the Lebanon. In London he became acquainted with Gladstone; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which hail kindled the lieart of England,
and,
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey's definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London nmid shouts of " Pence with Honor,'
and Armenia was left to stew.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by hris own people, ho
