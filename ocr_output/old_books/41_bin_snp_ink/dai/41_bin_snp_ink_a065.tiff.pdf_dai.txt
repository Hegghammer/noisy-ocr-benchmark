Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt; this uper-added evil, is, the
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians reater marauders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation of whose lives comprises
murder and robbery, and who have through we centuries unremittingly
quartered themselves upon the industrious chri peasants, and lived on
the fruits of their labour and toil. Indeed as amidieh cavalry which

industry, not the mos peace loving, law abiding instincts, can bring to the
Armenian peasant der Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
happiness, and security of life and property, which the law of all civilized
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil.
