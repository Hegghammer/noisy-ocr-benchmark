THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
pents twisting together. The end of the staff
lifted itself as though the serpents were rising
up.
The dwarf covered his eyes, and cried out,
"O Magus!"
"Remind me of the second dream that was
considered remarkable," said the King. And the
dwarf said, "The second dream was the Dream of
the Laden Ass."
“It is even so,” said the King. “I dreamed that
I looked down the Wayf the Lions, and there
came along the way a la ass. Of that dream
also those skilled in the gnification of dreams
could tell me nothing."
‘And yet the dream lain," said the En-
chanter, looking full in
eyes of the King.
‘A laden ass signifies
sure found
your
dream is of a treasure brought into your
palace."
"It is so," said the ar warf with the crown
of scarlet feathers upo head. “In dreams an
ass is always laden with asure."
"And what was my td dream?" said the
King.
