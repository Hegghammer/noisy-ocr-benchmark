Mr. Stuart T. Terry, of Southold, L. I., has kindly copied and for-
warded to me, many interesting facts from the New Haven Colonial
Records, some of which are here inserted :
"Concerning some farmers neere Southold, at a place called Hash-
amamock, aboute whom Barnabas Horton, one of ye Constables last
yeare, which was 1656, also, Constable in 1659. 29 May, 1661, Bar-
nabas Horton was a Deputy to the New Haven Court also, 31 May,
1654, the Deputies from Southold, presented to ye court a wrighting
from their towne, wherein it is desired that BARNABAS Horton and
JOHN PEAKEN, the two present Deputies of Southold, may be chosen
Constables for that plantation, which was done. Barnabas Horton
was a Deputy to the Court in New Haven, in 1654–56–58–59 and
1661. In 1655 there was no election, but he wrote a letter to the
Court on public affairs. In 1662 he was admitted a Freeman of Con-
necticut Colony, at Harford, and in 1663 and 1664 he was a Deputy
to the General Court, at Harford. He was a Magistrate in 1664, and
until his death. He is one of the Patentees of the Town of Southold
in 1676." Made his will May 10, 1680. Died 13 July, 1680. Will
