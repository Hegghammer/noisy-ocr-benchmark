PREFACE
ix
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific his-
torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and exalted the villains, for whom of old no
mud was too thick and slab. Beliefs are being
assailed on every side. To abolish the traditional
courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the considerate
conduct of Captain Hind would, therefore, be
strokes of the unkindest, and I have here attempted
no such iconoclasm. Even where I cannot be-
lieve, I have told the tale-whenever it has been
worth the telling as it is found in criminal
trials, or in Smith or Johnson, and other old
sources, decorously stripped of much vile language.
For real
That seems incredible
may be fut
the believable
turns ou
your only way.
To continue
e highwaymen from
Smith and Johnson
roaching end
of all such things in
ng of the nine-
teenth century, is like taking up and concluding
a half-told tale. But it was worth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpin has
always made, has it been found really necessary
to seriously consider and re-state the career of
that much-overrated scoundrel, and to put him
in his proper place a very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
