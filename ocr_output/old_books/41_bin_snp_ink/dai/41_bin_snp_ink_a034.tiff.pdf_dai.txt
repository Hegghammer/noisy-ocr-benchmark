That the Armenians should be constantly appealing to the Power that
had pledged itself for their protection, and that the same Power should be
constantly rallying the others, and making Ambassadorial demonstrations,
was enough to rouse the vilest passions of a nature in which no feelings
except vile passions existed.
Of all sins in this world, perhaps the sin of foolishness receives the
severest punishment, and of all crimes, the crime of failure meets with the
heaviest doom. For their foolishness in trusting in European protection
and hoping for European intervention the unfortunate Armenian aid with
rivers of their own blood, and for their crime of failure theyre made to
wallow in that blood. The darkest pages of their history been written
in the closing years of the nineteenth, and the early ye the twentieth
century; never since the loss of their independence enturies ago, had
they hoped for so much, and never had they paid
for their follv.
If they had carefully
ory of Europe's inter-
course with Asia, beginning
Macedonian Alexander;
they would have read in the
ent, self-interest, and self-
interest only written on every h.
they committed the folly of
GENERAL TER GOUKASSOFF.
Relieved the beleaguered Russian garrison
at Bayazid during the Russo-Turkish war of
1877, captured the fortress; and otherwise
distinguished himself during the war.
The other Armenian General who dis-
tinguished himself during the Russo-Turkish
war was General Lazaroff.
