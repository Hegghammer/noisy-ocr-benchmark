Church, but was also a fearless patriot-a distinguished linguist, an eloquent preacher, and a
thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, în
spite of the feared fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history.
At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nerces, the Patriarch, their object heing to request the signatory Powers of
the Berlin Treaty to force a guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.

was not so. One summer afternoon a most
cordial invitation was
ary of the Palace, requesting the Archbishop
to dine with him informal
this kind could not very well be r refused, so
the Archbishop, accompanie
ervant named Vartan, repaired to the Pasha's
house. The Pasha received 1

extreme courtesy to a private apart
the salamlik of his house (the men's quarters),
where dinner was served. The genia displayed by his host dispelled any fears that the
Archbishop might have had as to his
sonal safety.
After dinner, as usual, coffee was served. Now, this serving of the coffee is rather a
ceremonial according to high Turkish etiquette, and it is not unusal for guests to bring their
own tehooboukdar (the servant who carries his master's pipe and pouch and also superintends
the making of his coffee). The Archbishop was presented with a "tehoobouk" (pipe) filled
and lighted for smoking, and a servant followed with coffee. The Archbishop accepted both
with due compliments to his host, and took a sip at his coffee. Just at that moment the
heavy curtains over the doorway were thrown apart, revealing the ghastly pale face of his
servant Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, in a voice trembling with emotion, "Monseigneur,
I did not brew the coffee ! ”
This was enough for the Archbishop; he pretended to be startled and spilt the coffee, but,
alas! he had already drunk a small quantity of it. Meanwhile a seulle was going on behind
the portière, where his poor servant Vartan was paying the penalty of his devotion to his
master. Concerning Vartan's whereabouts or his ultimate end nothing was ever made public
the poor fellow simply vanished. Monseigneur Varjabétian, after a short interval thanked
the Pasha for his generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily summoned. The Patriarch took to his bed,
and lost all his hair through the effects of the poison. Then, one morning, when a servant
