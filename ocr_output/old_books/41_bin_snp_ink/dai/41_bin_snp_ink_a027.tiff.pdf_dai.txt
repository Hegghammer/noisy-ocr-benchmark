was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples which with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who
commerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase the value of
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few among them justly started an agitation, these our noble
and industrious brethren were being massacred. What a terrible scene! When we
left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our Armenian compatriots being
removed in manure carts; legs and arms were hanging down outside. This bloody seene will
ever remain impressed on my mind.
"This shocking erine of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a cursed absolutism, up to the last moment, grew wider. Even during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feelings which had been shown,
the awful events in Adam took place and the souls
Osmanlis melted into tears.
Up to the present time the deep sorrow caused by this event has not disappeared, because this
bloody wound in our soci body cannot easily be cured. While we fill our stomachs with
choice morsels, while we rt selfishly in our comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans, widows hungry, ked, and barefoot wanderther and thither, and thousands of
work, but what has happen is so great a calar that itt

them is also very heavy, because our Armenian countrymen live among wandering tribes.
We must all assist the government and point out its obligation. It must be declared in
public and periodically that the one of the most important duties of the Ottoman nation is to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and property of the
Armenians as well, since these are their sacred rights. Let investigations be made and let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim.”
