CANING; THE SEVEN STEPS
e, and the amate
That caning has not been undertaken to any appreciable extent
in school shops is due to the fact that instructors are unfamiliar
with the weaving processes. Caning is not difficult. It, in common
with many other lines of activity, is best learned thru observation.
However, it may be undertaken by the average person after careful
study of printed directions and illustrations. If the worker will
closely observe his work as it progresses, and follows instruc-

should be paid to directions which tell of errors to avoid. Errors
creep in, in a very unobtrusive manner at times, and the amateur
will find them hard to detect.

which possess long, slender, reedlike stems. The name should apply

matted undergrowth which makes passage difficult or impossible.
These palms are trailing in tendency, yet frequently grow to tree
height. They then fall over and lie on the ground. The stem is
covered with beautiful green foliage, grows to a length of 100 to
300 ft., and rarely exceeds 1 in. in diameter. The stems are cu
into lengths of 10 to 20 ft. for export. The outer bark is strip
into widths varying from 1/16 to 3/16 in. These strips
into hanks of 1,000 lineal feet each. The cane is then
the cane weaver, A hank of cane costs from 60 cents
