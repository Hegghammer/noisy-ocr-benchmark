which this is typical:
Whan shaws bene sheene and shroddes full fayre,
And leaves both large and longe,
Itt's merry walking in the fayre forrist
To hear the small birdes songe,
To se the dere draw to the dale,
And leve the
And shadow hem
Under the grene-w
d of
es;
sible
is now
It is the springtime of
English nation that you gl√¨
a picture of that larger rural
adventure, and uncontaminated
a thing of the past.
Nature is portrayed in
vividness and certainty that

The woodweele sang a

Sitting upon the s
Soe lowde, he wake Robin Hood,
In the greenwoo
here he lay.
It is versification of ne simplest and the most
sincere kind.
Robin Hood, real or imaginary character, has
himself no criminal taint, but he is one of the
VOL. I.
