Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
Turkish rule? To this question, we must answer an emphatic No !
The causes that must operate against any change are many and deep-
seated. In the first place it cannot be expected that a few Turks of liberal
ideas (or it may be French polished) at Constantinople, are going to change
the thought and character of the nation. The characteristics of a people
change very slowly, if they ever change at all, and the predominant national
traits of the many blooded modern Turk have been shown to the world to
be, cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a fierce sensuality; and what is
more than all, and which has to be remembered most, is, that they are a
people accustomed the unbridled gratification of their worst passions.
The ethnographic its of the Turkman which history bears out, are
wildness and fierceness, a it would not be incorrect to argue that with the
instincts of his primitive an ors have been assimilated the many cross
currents that run in his

To quote again the eminent

Not the Jewish it proclaiming itself God's elect and chosen, and
originating the naheathen" which it scorned. Not the Christian conceit
emanating from the Jewish source, and laying the flattering unction to its
soul of superiority over the "heathen" of its own time. Not the unbending
caste exclusiveness of the Brahman across whose path even the shadow of
the despised Sudra falling would be deemed defilement. Not any of these,
can equal the intolerant religious pride of the Mahommedan, or reach the
pinnacle of religious self-sufficiency on which he has seated himself. To be
a Mahommedan, is enough-Cela suffit.
To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans, and
intimate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahommedan is above all things a Mahommedan. His
religion is the paramount question in his life, and remains its predominating
feature above everything else. This should not be surprising, since to the
faithful" Paradise is secured, and all crimes and transgressions against
"unbelievers" absolved.
