III. James, son of Hon. William Ho
âœ”me Covert, born
at Sommers, New York, 23 January, 17 married 15 May, 1800,
to MARTHA WHITE, born at White Plains, March, 1775. She died

He was about sixteen years of age when his father moved to Col-
chester, Delaware County, New York, where he endured the hard-
ships and privations incident to a frontier settlement. In 1806 he
moved from Colchester to Chaumont, Jefferson Co., New York, then
a dense forest. He settled permanently on Point Salubrious, being
the first family of white people who ever settled there. Here he was
again exposed to hardships, causing continued ill health, until his
death, which occurred on 5th November, 1833. He and his wife were
members of the Baptist Church. He was a warm supporter of religion
and a lover of good order in society, which he always labored zealously
and successfully to promote. He was temperate in his habits and ex-
emplary in his character. He never disgraced the name he bore, and
his virtues are worthy of imitation by all his posterity. He and his
elder brother Henry settled near each other on Point Salubrious,
which is a neck of land running out about four miles into Chamount
Bay. Here they took up farms, had fine fishing grounds, and raised
large families. Letter of Van Rantz Horton.
