speak with certainty in regard to the port-
holes on deck E. I believe that the first list
the ship took brought her down to these
open ports on the starboard side and that
she sank much more quickly from filling

my return to the deck I felt that the
steamer must make her final plunge any mo-

better leave them on the deck to t them
take their chance at a piece of wrecge.
