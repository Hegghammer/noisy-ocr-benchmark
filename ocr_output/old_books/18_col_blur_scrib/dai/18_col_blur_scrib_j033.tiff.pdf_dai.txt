started in this manner. It is best that the amateur work from the
center, both ways. He in otherwise when he understands
the work better. The operations on the seat to be shown
are the same as those descried in the seven steps in caning. They
never vary. The only new thing involved here is the shape of the
seat. Fig. 20 is a photograph of a chair seat of an old shape, an
irregular ellipse. It shows the first step half completed. Note here
that the last strand skips two holes, one at the front and one at
the back. This is necessary to keep strands as nearly the same
distance apart as possible. Fig. 21 shows the first step completed
