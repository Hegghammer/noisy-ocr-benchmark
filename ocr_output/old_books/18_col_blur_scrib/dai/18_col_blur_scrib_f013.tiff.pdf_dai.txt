PREFACE

Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we belieced in when schoolboys. Scientific hi
torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and era the eillains, for chom of old no
mud was thick and slab. Beliefs are being
assailed on every side. To abolish the traditional
courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the considerate
conduct of Captain Hind would, therefore, be
strokindest, and I hace here attempted
no such iconoclasm. Even where I cannot be
liece, I hace told the tale-chenecer it has been
worth the telling as it is found in criminal
trials, or in Smith on Jahren and ahen
sources, decorously stripped of much eile language.
For really, where much that seems incredible
may be fully proved and where the believable
turns out not rarely to be false, 'tis your only way.
To continue the story of the highwaymen from
Smith and Johnson down to the approaching end
of all such things in the beginning of the
teenth century, is like taking up and concluding
a half-told tale. But it was worth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpin has
always made, has it been found really necessary
to seriously consider and re-state the career of
that much-overrated scoundrel, and to put him
in his proper place: a very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
