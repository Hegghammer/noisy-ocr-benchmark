Jeremiah also settled in Massachusetts. There was a John Horton in
New York, in 1645, but no one has been found claiming descent from
him. He probably returned to England.
It is not known from what place in England either Thomas or Jen
miah came, nor is there any certain evidence that they were brot
of Barnabas, but three coming over about the same time would
favor the tradit they were brothers.
The Head arter of Cæsar's army was near the present Leicester,
the principal town of that county, and the Horton name has been
known there to the remotest period of any authentic records. This
fact, together with the name itself, favors the idea that the family was
of Roman origin. The name in olden time was frequently written
Orton, and it
originally from the same family, and perhaps also the Nortons.

ANTIQUITY OF THE HORTON FAMILY.
The antiquity of the Horton Family is established by the fact the
one Robert De Horton, manumitted a bondman to his manor of
Hrton, long before the time of Henry Lasey, Earl of Lincoln, who
ied in 1310. It is also ascertained that the Hortons had a manor-

William Horton, Esq., of Frith House, in Barksland, Halifax,
descended from the above-mentioned Robert, married Elizabeth,

about 1640, viz.:
1. Williams, of Harkisland, or Birk Island Hall, who purchased in the
Charles L., the state of Howroyde, was born about 1576.
2. Joseph, born about 1578.—Burke's Landel Gentry, vol. 1, p. 345-
It is held that this Joseph settled in Mousely, Leicester Co., and
was the father of Barnabas Horton. It is highly
nabas was not the old, and not inheriting real estate, may have
been one reason for emigrating to America.
It is known ☑pt. Jeremy Horton, 18 Aug., 1626, was the
master and owner of the ship "Swallow," of Barnstable, and that he
made voyages to New England, in 1633 and 1638, and in a subsequent
voyage he was shipwrecked and several lives lost-the crew and master
came to Boston, but the vessel was lost.
Capt. Roger Horton, about this time, had a prisoner delivered to
