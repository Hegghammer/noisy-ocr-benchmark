Sixth Generation.â€”Joseph 1.
It is a rare occurrence to find a family of children, ten in number, the
youngest forty-six years old, all living. And then so many grand-
children and great-grandchildren living. I have no record of any
family equal to it, and doubtless, the number is now (1875), somewhat
augmented.
