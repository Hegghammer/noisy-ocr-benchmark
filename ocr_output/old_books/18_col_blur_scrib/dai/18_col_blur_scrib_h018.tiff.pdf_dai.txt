Preface-Introduction

It is said that Barnabas Horton I. was large in stature, and of a
raddy complexion, and of fine social qualities
His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It is elevated at eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. The orginal base was of brick, but it had all crumbled down
many years ago The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Horton.
The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads as
follows:
"Here lieth buried the body of Ms. BARNABAS HORTON, who was born at
Mouse mmm England, and died at Southold, on the 13th day of
July, 1680, aged So years."

In the centre of the stone we find the Epitaph, as follows:
"Here lies my body med indust
Till Christ shall come to raise it with the just;
My soul ascend
Where with sweet Jesus now I make abode
Then hasten after me, my dearest wife,
To be partaker of this blessed life
And you, dear children, all follow the Lord,
Hear and obey His public sacred word;
And in your houses call upon His name,
For oft I have advised you to the same
Then God will bless you with your children all,
And to this Messed place He will you call."

Hels. x√• : 4.* He being dead, yet speaketh."
It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the one the original
thirteen who brought his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a comdable desire to see that his name and memory
should not from the earth.
