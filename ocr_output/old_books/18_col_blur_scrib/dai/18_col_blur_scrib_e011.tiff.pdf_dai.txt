PREFACE
ating
from any
writing in praise of the moderate use of Corsets dese facts,
experiences, and grounds of argument from the very-day life and
general of the present period.
The Crinoline is too closely associated with the Corset and with the
mutable modes affected by ladies, from season to season, to be omitted
volume which treats of Fashion. The same facts, indeed, may be
stated of both the Crinoline and the Corset. Both appear to be equally
indimmmbe woman of the present period. To make them
serve the purposes of increased cleanliness, comfort, and grace, not only
without injury to the health, but with positive and admitted advantage
to the physique-these are the problems to be solved by those whose
business it is to minister to the ever-changing taste and fashion of
the day.
