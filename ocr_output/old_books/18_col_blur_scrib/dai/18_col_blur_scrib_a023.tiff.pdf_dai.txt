orgy, except to call them fiends incarnate; and who is the bold man who
can guarantee that these same fiends incarnate have become metamorphosed
stantinople are capable of controlling and restraining them. We ating
even heard that the leaders and participators of the last oneres have
been punished as they deserved; and what is the fathey are left un-
punished? because the Government is afraid to punish Mahommedans for
killing Ch; because the liberal Turks dare not punish the "true
believers for llling "Kaffirs."
The region of Mahommed, the religion of the sword, has been infused
into the Turk, and to understand the effect of the religion of Mahommed
upon the Turk, it is necessary to regard it from four aspects, or from four
points of analysis. First, the fundamental doctrine and law of the religion.
Second the character of the founder as an example to his followers. Third,
the racial and ethnographic characteristics of the Turk. Fourth, the effect
which this particular religion would be likely to have on this particular race.
When we have viewed the Turk and his government from these four ints
of analysis, we have the explanation of all the woe and desolation which
have lain over the countries under Turkish rule.
"When ye encountmanni heads until you
have made a great slaughter of them is a chapter of the Koran which the
Turk has religiously and steadfastly made his creed.
In conclusion, I will ask my readers to compare one point of difference
between the two races, the oppressor and the oppressed. Thousands upon
thousands of Armenian women, thousands upon thousands of Armenian
children, have been hounded to death, or savagely, ferociously, horribly and
loathsomely maltreated by the Turk, and yet in all the agonizin years when
Massacre has succeeded upon Massacre, has there been one known
one single instance of a Turkish weman or child maltreated by menia
The last massacres though especially orge from the Pala
Constantinople, were officially announced to originate from an affray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed one of the three
given equal numbers and arms, the Armenian always a match for the
Turk, but alas for him that unequal numbers and want of arms have always
made him the
am of his oppressor.
Ahmed Bey in the first part (Ses Causes) of his book "La Crise de
L'Orient published in Paris in 1907 holds a brief for his nation which
through its own fallacious arguments falls to the ground. I will quote one
passage as an example.
