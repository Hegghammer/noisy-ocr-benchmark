"Isaac Horton moved from Colchester to Laberty, Sullivan Co.,
N. Y., 4 mm 826. The snow fell in April, after they
moved, about two feet deep. He had a large stock of cows, sheep and
hogs. In his flock of sheep were twenty-two ewes, the finest that could be
found in Colchester, nearly all of them only two years old. He drove
them to Liberty. Wolves were seen on the way near Parkesville.
He arrived at Liberty Falls-salted his sheep in the evening. The
next morning the sheep were gone, and Isaac and his son Roy, went
up the hill at Liberty Falls to look mmmmmmm
learing they found dead sheep scattered along the log fence, and
oers dying. Nearly all the flock were killed. They even killed a
mb in the pen adjoining the house.
"In 1837, Isaac Horton hirty-seven grandchildren, all living
but two. His children all lived to maturity.”—(Letter G. B. Horton,
1871.)
Isaac Horton was a member of the Baptist Church, of Colchester;
but after he moved to Liberty, Sullivan Co., N. Y., he usually attended
the Episcopal Church. He built a grist-mill at Liberty Fall in
1827 o 1828, another in 1841-42. He was quite extensively of
in the manufacture of bed-posts and other turned work, including
wooden bowls; also in shipping curled and birds-eye maple. Politi-
cally he was a whig, and an ardent supporter of Clay and Webster.
He died 10 May, 1855. She is still living.
