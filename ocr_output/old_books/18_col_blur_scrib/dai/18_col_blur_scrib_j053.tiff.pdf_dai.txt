Rectangular Seats-As stated, in weaving a square seat the
initial process is repeated at all corners until all openings are filled.
In rectangular seats the spaces on the short rails will fill before

impossible. Fig. 42 shows a partly woven seat with the short rails
lled, and the process of filling up the remaining area under way.
The method is this: Go over and under a long rail, across half the
frame opening and up thru, then across the remaining distance, a

pleted. Fig 43 is a ske partly woven seat, illustrating the
photograph and makes the method clearer.
It should be noted that the strands in croming at the center must
be compressed one-half of their diameters. They will need to be
tapped sharply with a small mallet or hammer to produce proper
