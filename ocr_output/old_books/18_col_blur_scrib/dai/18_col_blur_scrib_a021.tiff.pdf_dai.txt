earth as other nations? Does Humanity, does Christianity allow that tender
babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and butchered
before the eyes of their mothers, or that the ears of mothers should be
with the cries of the dying agony of their murdered children?
Humanity, does Christianity allow that helpless women she forcibly
subjected to the most hideous, the most loathsome,
fost revolting, and
the most cruel outrages? Does Humanity, does Chistianity, allow all this?
Christinvernments have organized a Hague Conference of Peace
and Civilization, at they have closed its doors to the cause of a bleeding
christian race roaning under the yoke of the cruellest oppressors that the
world has yet known. Christian men and women have held up their hands
in horror at the Indian Juggernauth; but alas! the political wheels of
Christian Governments have been a Greater Juggernauth for a helpless
christian race. It is by Christian Governments that "we are made as the

Christian Powers should be all gathered together, one against another, in the
Empire of your Oppressors, as eagles gather togester yound a carcase; but
really there is no help for it; and if you must de deously by a hellish
extermination, why then you must die, and we have to condone your hellish
extermination, for in any case, each one of us must secure his own political
and commercial interests in this same Oppressors."
In "Transcia and Ararat," published by Mr. James Bryce in 1876
