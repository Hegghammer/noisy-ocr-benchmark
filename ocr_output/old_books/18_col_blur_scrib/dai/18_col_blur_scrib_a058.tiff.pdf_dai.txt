took his breakfast upstairs he found, to his horror, that both the bedroom door and the
window were wide open and his beloved master lay dead in his bed, which was covered with
blood! There are no such things as coroners and juries in Turkey to ascertain the causes of
mysterious deaths of this kind, but the news that the Patriarch was dead spread like wildfire
through Constantinople. The Saltan himself thought it advisable to show some concern in
details of this "sal catastrophe," as they termol it. The official statement at the
Archbishop died of dysentery. Only a very few know how the Archad died, and
they wisely kept their mouths shut.
I was told the details of this story by a high official of the Armenian Patriarchate. It
ses that as
on did not act as quickly as the Patriarch's enemies had anticipatel,
owing to hising en cautioned in the nick of time, they had to resort to other means"!
The funeral as largest ever witnessed in Constantinople, with an escort of Turkish
cavalry sent specially by the Saltan, and representatives of all the religious denominations
and the Diplomatic Corps. I was myself present, representing a foreign Government.
