CHAPTER VI

REID AND SPLINT WEAVING
Reeds which are used extensively for basket-mal
mn
in general are procured from the species of palm described in Chap
These reeds should not be confused with the term reed
lied to several distinct species of large water loving grames
Such reeds are usually designated under the name of grasses. There
are a thousand species of palm distributed over the tropical regions
of the entire world, but only a few are native in the United States,
and these are of no distinct commercial value. The rattan or cane
palms of India and the Malay Islands grow to an unusual height,
and are imported into this country in great quantities. These rat-
tans and the trailing palm of the species Golemas have as main
esport centers Singapore and Calcutta. These palms are stripped
of leaves and bark and split into round and flat strips of different
diameters and widths. The outer hark, when stripped into proper
sizes, is known as chair cane; the entire palm, with leaves removed,
is commercially known as rattan; and the fat reeds are frequently
sold as flat rattan and pith cane. Inasmuch as these flat and round
strips, split from the palm plant and exported under the name of
rattan are called reeds, we shall refer to them under that name in
all discussions to follow are two qualities of reed on the
market sold under the nu China reed and German reed. The
former is inferior in and the latter is superior, being strong,
nough and durable. The Philippine Islands give promise of pro-
ducing a liberal supply of reed of good quality that is claimed to
equal the German product. The problem, however, is one of gath-
ering and marketing the product. The government has made a
partial survey of the rattan supply, and this justifies the belief that
the Islands will eventually compete with the world market.
