CHAPTER 1
CANING: THE SEVEN STEPS
That caning has not been undertaken to any appreciable extent
in school shops is due to the fact that instructmmmmm
with the weaving processes Caning is not difficult. It, in common
many other lines of activity, is best learned thru observation
ver, it may be undertaken by the average person after careful
stody of printed directions and illustrations. If the worker will
closely observe his own work as its and follows instruc-
tions carefully, he should have no uval difficulty in caning an
area very acceptably in the initial attempe. Particular attention
should be paid to directions which tell of errors to aveid. Errors
creep in, in a very unobtrusive manner at times, and the amateur
will find the hard to detect.
Cane-Cane is the namie applied to a great number of plants
which poeg, der, reedlike stems. The name should apply
only to a class of palms called rattans. These plants are found
throout the Indian Archipelago, China, India, Ceylon, and the
Malay Peninsula. They grow in dense, dark forests and form a
matted undergrowth which makes passage difficult or imposible.
These palms are trailing in tendency, yet frequently grow to treeman
height. They then fall over and lie on the ground. The stem is
covered with beautiful gre lage, grows to a length of 100 to
300 ft, and rarely ex
in diameter. The stems are cut
into length of so to 20 it, for export. The outer hark is stripped
into width varying from 1/16 to 3/16 in. These strips are put
into hanks of 1000 lineal feet each. The cane is then ready for
the came weaver. A hank of cane costs from 60 cents to $1. The
width of the cane and its quality determines the price per hank
