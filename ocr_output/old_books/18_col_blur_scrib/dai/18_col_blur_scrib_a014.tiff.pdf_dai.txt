SCENE OF THE MASSACRES IN ASIA MINOR.
The trouble began in Adana. ' An armed mob strengthened and augmented by soldiers
fell in overwhelming numbers upon the unarmed Christians. The Armenian population of
Antioch and vicinity were practically wiped out and the Armenian villages in the
Alexandretta district destroyed with immense loss of life. Hadjim, ab and the neigh-
bouring villages were burned. The Armenian quarter in Tarsus was rumande
Marash stained again with the blood of thousands of Armenians. Zeitdon Colat
entire population of Kirikon between Aleppo and Alexta were massacred
Tube Tob and the soldiers burned what they coulot arry away, so that the material
loss has been enormous. In place of the former abandal thriving industries there are
instend desolated provinces and the charred and blackened remains of pillaged and ruined
homes, and the residue of those who escaped massacre are reduced to homelessnes and
starvation,
