turn brown. This is ally about the middle of August. The
leaves are tied in loose bundles for convenience in handling, and
dried in the shade, preferably a darkened room. They should re-
main here until thoroly dry. Before using, soak the rush about
ten hours in water. Less time is required if warm water is used.

Before weaving, the butt ends of the leaves are cut off about a
foot from the base. These are too course and stiff to weave proper
ly. One leaf may be used or two leaves may be twisted together mnn
make a strand. Three leaves make a coarse strand, two a medium,
and one a fine strand
right twist is necessary to produce
an even, smooth strand twisting is always done in one direc-
tion. One leaf is recommended for beginners in rush seating, for
adding to one is much simpler than adding to several. The under
side of the seat need not be as smooth and as well woven as the top
In fact, twisting need not be done underneath at all unless the
individual worker so desires.
Raffia is easy to manipulate because of its pliability, even when
dry. Several lengths will need to be twisted together to produce a
