from Smith, who himself was prone to include
the most extravagant myths in his pages, cal
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE LI AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAMOUS
HIGHWAYMEN. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the "truth" of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.
No one has ever reprinted those authors in
the extravagance, or their grossness.
It would be impossible; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
them, or even written an independent history of
the highwaymen. When we consider hore astonish
ingly popular those romances have ever been
which have had Claude Du Vall, and Turpin,
and their like for heroes, this is not a little
surprising.
Perhaps the task has been abandoned because
of the difficulty-the almost insuperable difficulty
-of sifting fact from fiction, and because of a
chilling sense that it would be a thankles tack
to present the higheayman as he really was: a
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No noved
to
service; do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
