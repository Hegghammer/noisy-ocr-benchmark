BEAT WEAVING

Care must be exercised to keep the strands from overlapping im-
properly at the corners. The strands should fit snugly where they
go over the rails. To aware this, tap the sharply with a mallet
wed over a block of soft wood. This may be done at frequent
intervals or when several strands have been woven over each rail

Uniform tension on the strand is desirable and this should be tight.
As the work progresses the interior between the upper and lowen
rows of strands is stuffed. This is done with the same material as
butt ends of rush are used to stuff
the seat of rush; raffi to stuff a raffia seat; craft paper to
stuff a fiber seat; and so on. The packing should be done in a thore
manner, for it builds up the seat and prevents its breaking down at
the inner edges of the rails, and sagging with continued use. A
slightly curved hardwood stick about 12 in. long may be used to
advantage to do this work. Fig. 41 shows a sketch of such a stick
It is 3 in. in diameter at one end and tapered to Â½ in. by in. at
