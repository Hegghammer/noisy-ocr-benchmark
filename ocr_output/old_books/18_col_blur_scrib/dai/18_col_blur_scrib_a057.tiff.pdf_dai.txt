thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the fearol fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the wind and took
a step that will long be remembered in the anuals of Armenian history,
At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were track to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrivastantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nerces, the Patriarch, their object being to ret the signatory Powers of
the Berlin Treaty to force a guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important impots in Armenia.
Abdul Hamid and his advisers were furious at this affront, and Monseigneur Nerces was
summoned to the ce. It is said that when he received the summons he simply smiled
and asked one of of his curates to read the Barial Service to him, as he did not expect to
return alive. However, he went. No one has ever heard what passed between the Sultan
and himself at the interview; suffice it to say that he immediately summoned the Armenian
General Assembly and tendered his resignation. This was not accepted by the Assembly,
and, amidst enthusiastic cheers, he was carried back to his apartments at the Patriarchate.

er reached him, signed by the Sultan, to recall the Armenian
delegation from Berlin. This Monseigneur Varjabétian point-blank refased to do, and retired
to his private residence at Haskeuy, a village on the Golden Horn. The success of the
gation, however, did not come up to his expectations. The Armenians, as it happened, ald
not be heard, hat they were so far successful as to have an article inserted in the treaty.
The Sultan and his advisers never forgave the Patriarch this, though they could not
openly do anything to him on account of his enormous popularity. Time passed on, and to
cial invitation was sent by a very high dignitary of the requesting the Archbishop
dine with him informally. An invitation of this kind could not very well be refusol, so
he Archbishop, accompanied only by a body-servant named Vartan, repaired to the Pasha's
The Fasha received him at the door and escorted the visitor with much ceremony and
extreme courtesy to a private apartment of the salamlik of his house (the men's quarters),
where dinner was served. The geniality displayel by his host dispelled any fears that the
Archbishop might have had as to his personal safety.
After dinner, as usual, coffee was served. Now, this serving of the rather
ceremonial according to high Turkish etiquette, and it is not unusal for gues
own tehoolealder (the servant who carries his master's pipe and pouch and
the making of his coffee). The Archbishop was presented with tehooloak (ppe) del
and lighted for smoking, and a servant followed with coffee. Archbishop accepted
with due compliments to his host, and took a sip at his coce. ut at that moment the
heavy curtains over the doorway were thrown apart, revealine glastly pale face of his
servant Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, in a voice trembling with emotion, "Monseigneur,
I did not brew the coffee!"
This was enough for the Archbishop: he pretended to be started and spilt the coffee bat

master. Concern artan's whereabouts or his nitimate end nothing was ever made pul

the Pooha for his generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily summoned. The Patriarch took to his bed,
and lost all his hair through the effects of the poison. Then, one morning, when a servant
