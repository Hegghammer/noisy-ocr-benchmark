was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples which with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who cus
commerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few among them justly started
agitation
our noble
and industrions brethren were being massacred. What a fassene! When weleft the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our menian compatriots being
removed in many arts; legs and arms were hanging down outside. This bloody scene will
ever remain in
on my mind.
"This shekingime of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a cursed absolutism, up to the last moment, grew wider. Even during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feelings which had been shown,
the awful events in Adana took place and the souls of all true Osmanlis melted into tears.
Up to the present time the deep sorrow caused by this event has not disappeared, because this
bloody wound in our social body cannot easily be cured. While we fill our stomschs with
choice mmm selfishly in our comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
families are fleeing from the fatherland. We are convinced that the government is doing i
work, but what has happened is so great a calamity that it can keep a government har
years. However much sacrifice we may make, still it will be inadequate, because the
happiness of the fatherland depends on healing such blood wounds as these as soon as possible.
We are convinced that the government and all connected with it are persuaded of this as well as
ourselves. We zaust now wipe out the traces of the misfortune brought by a cursed period.
We must now comfort weeping mm
mmmhose who do not
stand that patriotism and brotherhood do not differ from each other. The responsibility
the government for the Armenians is very great and very weighty. The whole Ottoman
ation is under obligations to protect this suffering race, because the liberty we enjoy today
marge part due to the blood shed by the Armenians. We thought that those truths
were so obvious that we keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary from time to time to recall the greatness of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yesterday has endured only barbarism, and for twelve years
has been constantly oppressed and ground to the earth, and has given thouse victims
Hereafter we must work to assure them that the era of massacres has passed
strength of mind and soul we must quiet them. The obligation of the govern

We must all assist the government and point out its obli It must be declar

protect, together with those of other races, the interests, life, and property of the
Armenians as well, since these are their sacrel rights. Let investigations be rade and let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim."
This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare discose
his identity; and account given by an authority like Mr. James Bry
surely refute facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres a les Massacres occasionnés par les aventuriers Arméniens."
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
