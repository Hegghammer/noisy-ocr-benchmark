CANING: THE SEVEN STEPS
m
open squares are thus formed over the area being caned. Unless
the cane is soaked it will prove rather difficult to pair the canes
Step 5. This step is the weaving of one set of diagonals. Start
se strand at any corner hole. Use one hand over and one under
e frame. As the worker becomes skilful he will find it easier
to give the cane a slight curve and work with both hands on the
upper surface. Use an end of cane

long mough for convenient hand-
then pull the entire strand
the length of the frame, pro-
in

Care must be taken to avoid twist-
ing the cane. The case will run
easily, and partially under a cane
at the corners of the squares, if cor
rectly done. Fig. 6 shows this
clearly, as does the illustration in
Fig. 27. The second illustration

webbing, is approximely half sine,
and will supplement the freehand
sketch. The corners will hind, and the strand will pull with diff-
culty if the cane is incorrectly woven. On parallel canes note that
the canes either run seur or under the pairs

Step 6. This step is identical with the preceding one. The canes
are at right angles to the first diagonals. In this step and the
preceding one note the strands run into the corner holes.
This holds true in all regular frames where a corner hole is
bored. It permits the strands to run in as straight a line as pos-
sible. If it is necessary to turn abrupely to enter a hole it is obvious
that an error has been made by the weaver
Step 7. Pull a cane of the same size as used in the other steps up
thru a hole, over the binder cane and down thru the same hole.
A loop is thus formed and the binder secured. Pull tast, then
