4 HALF-HOURS WITH THE HIGHWAYMEN

later at the Old Bailey, he never showed to
advantage, Sixteen String Jack excepted, with
his pea-green coat and his bouquet, as big as
cabbage. And as the eighteenth century closed
and gate place to the nineteenth, the mounted
highwayman gradually disappeared, and the foot-
pad, a miserable, muddy, cowardly figure, for
whom no one ever had a good word, is seen in
his dark lurk, in the wayside ditch, not often
courmmmh to work alone, and generally
found in couples, ready perhaps with the suffo-
cating pitch-plasters that so terrified the wayfarers
of that time.
The footpad never had the slightest inkling
of romance, and was alunta habari
zelapped that pitch-plaster over your mouth, or
terrified you, or finished off his examination of
your pockets by knocking you down and jumping
on your body. A far cry, indeed, from the
generous days of Captain Hind, or Claude Du
Vall.
No one would ever contemplate a work on
"Half-Hours with the Footpads." It would
to introduce the reader into the very worst of
society, and the least entertaining; and so we
come by degrees to the present era of the house-
breakers and the newspaper recorder
may seek romance if you will.
The hiry of the highwaymen is a lengthy
emergence from ancient fables and marvellous
rustic folklore, to more settled records. It is not
peculiar in that gradual development, Such is
V.
