like a round how, a great brown eye revealed the inward spirit's intelligence and zeal un-
quenched. On his head was a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.
Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest men-
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery callel Etchmiatzin, or "egotten
is Descended." From the window of a neighboring room he looked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now ut efore and buried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling soon and hurricane that hid the
cone of Arar And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last paddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of the lake eighty-seven years ago, Khrimian was born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still diminished by sea or land; the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom-a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Near East. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos now looked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to last it had been inspired by one absorbing and unselfish aim-the freedom and
regeneration of his people. It is true he had failel.
From his earliest years, when he had witnessed the terrors of Turkish oppresion in
homes of Armenians round Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality-
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance am the
prosperous and contented of the world. He began as a poet, wandering far and wide trough
the Turkish, Persian, and Rassian sections of Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glories of their national history,
Entering the monastic order after his wife's death, he devoted himself to the building of schools,
which be generously threw

Zars, while Europe was occupied with Crimcan wars, Austrian wars, or French and German
wars, we see hita ceaselessly journeying from Van to Constantinople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emislems of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When elector armenian patriarch of Constantinople (1800), he was driven from
his office after four years.
But the cup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiless slaughter of lations and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. W
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople,
himself summoned to plead his people's cause before the Comes of
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visite he great courts of
beforchand, urging them to create an autonomous neutral state for Armenia, as they had
done with success for the Lebanon. In London he became inted with Gladstone; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and
