women and little children who have survived a painful flight to the scoast and hay

"Can you ine the feelings of the Kessab people as they climbed on foot the long trail

ruined dwellings? Their stores of wheat, barley and rice had been burned; clothing, cooking
utensils, farnir tools had gone; their goats, cows and males had been stolen; their silk
industries stamped out; their beloved churches reduced to smouldering heaps. The bodies of

As these sheets are going through the press there comes news of famine
at Zeitoon. The Rev. F. W. Macullum, American Missionary at Mash,
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet, American 
Missionary at Constantinople, that
12,000 souls in and around Zeitoon are 
dying of hunger; they are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran and water, 
and cooking and
get even that. Rev. Mamm
to us from all
des. As we foresaw all along, from 
now on the distress will be greatest."
If 50,000 were massacred, the list of those who have died and are dying
of homelessness and starvation will exceed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerated. Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.
The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered nigh attack
by armed Kurds, and the villagers are now reduced to reme distress. Before
the outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mura repeatedly appeared
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec
tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It is
evident that the authorities at Constantin to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
