CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

au opposite theory, in which instinctive agency is rejected, and the appearances are explained from
a consideration of the necessities and voluntary exertions of the animal. With regard to the
observer, it has been asserted, that it is by experience alone that he distinguishes the signs of the
passions; that we learn, while infants, to consider smiles as expressions of kindness, because they
are accompanied by acts of beneficence and by endearmeuts; and frowns as the coutrary, because
we find them followed by blows; that the expression of anger in a brute, is only that which has
been observed to precede his biting ; and that of foudness, his fawning and licking of the hand.
With regard to the creature itself, it is said, what has been called the external signs of passion, are
merely the concomitants of those voluntary movements, which the passions or habits suggest; that
the glare of the Lion's eye, for example, is the consequence of a voluntary exertion to see his prey
more clearly-his grin, or snarl, the natural motion of uneasing his fangs before he uses them.
This, however, is not quite true of all animals and of all expression of passion."

assigned the to serve as the organs of this language: that, on the other hand, there is in the lower
animals no range of expression which is not fairly referable as a mere accessary to the voluntary
or needful actions of the animal; and that this accessary expression does not appear to be in any
nmm the variety and extent of the animal's passious."
" There appears to me (continues Mn. BELL) to be no expression in the face of any animal
lower in the scale of being than quadrupeds; aud in them the grongest and most marked
expression is that of rage the object of which is opposition, resistance, and defence. But on
examination it is merely an accessary of
the motions natural to the accomplishment of the object which the animal has in view) that the
