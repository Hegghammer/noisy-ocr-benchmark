THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE,

Investigation proves to us that the taste for slender, waists orialled
even more in the Eastern nations than in those of Europe, and we find
las
that other areans besides that of compression have been extensively
taken adyamage of. Humboldt, in his personal narrative, describes the
women of and informs us that the reddish clay called "ampo" is
eaten by them in order that they may become slim, want of plumpness
being a kind of beauty in that country. Though the use of this
earth is fatal to health, those desirous of profiting by its reducing

and no young lady is considered the perfection of fashionable elegance
unless a great number of qualities and graces are possessed; not the

standard for the perfection of waist-measurement has been almost
world-wide. From the coral-fringed and palm-decked islands of the
Pacific and Indian Ocean we have but to travel to the grass-clad Dail)
of Crim Tartary and the rock-crowned fastnesses of Circassia, to
same tastes prevailing, and even more potent means in force for the
ASB
obtainment- of a taper form. Any remarks from us to the beauty of
the ladies of Circassia would be needless, their clanm to that enviable
endowment being too well established to call for confirmation at our
hands, and that no pains are spared in the formation of their figures
will be best segn by a quotation from a recent traveller who writes on
the subject
