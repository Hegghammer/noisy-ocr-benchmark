the scene of which, by the way, he has not represented as a royal menagerie, but as a wild,
roeky eavern-his animals partake of the artificial character of which we cannot bring ourselves to
approve.
Of this fact, however, we purpose to exhibit proof with our assertion. Improved versions, to
the best abilities of our Artists, of some of these Lions of RUBENS and the Assyrian king, will here
be introduced, which the reader, who pleases, may compare with the originals. Our second, third,
and fourth Plates are of the number.
The Lions of RUBENS are humanized. We do not intend to discuss at length whether the
ideality of allegorieal painting required this: we only state the fact : yet the opinions which we
felt at liberty to form on the subject, we feel at liberty to utter. So much in apology for using the
licence of asserting that the hends of many of the Lions of RUBENS rather resemble those of frowning
old gentlemen decorated with Ramillies wigs; as if Nature's journeymen had made mancs, and not
made them well. There is a profusion of flowing and curling hair which seems rather to solicit
the unguents of the perfumer, than to have endured the hea the desert, or the rough
storms of the forest. The shag di a Lion's O is a very different sort of thing.
However such dressed Lion fa Le thought to accord with Allegory, they are demonstrably
variance with Nature. To be sure, what might become a Lion in the procession of the Cardinal
artues, might be rather unsuitable in lis den, or within the preciucts of those wild haunts, where he
is accustomed to roam in his natural state. We have often read of the fabled Men-bulls, or (Mino-
taurs,) and we find such on the coinage of Crete. These allegorical creatures of RUBENS, which,
alas ! have sometimes been quoted by Artists without half his geuius, and placed in savage con-
beside their Britaunias-are a species of Men-lions Placed among the Sabrean seulp-
tures, they might pass for incarnations of Sol in Leo; but/would very ill pass for Leo alone.
Among the observers of this poetic improvement, this natural and unpoetical deficieuey, on
the part of RUBENS, TITIAN, JULIO ROMANO, and other painters, both ancient and modern; and

the publie "looked up to them for light" on that subject, (to use the language of
STERNE,) they thought the Public " deserved A:" and they therefore, as the best practical means
of elieiting that light, first copied the general forms and attitudes of most of the wild animials that
appear in this book, from the old masters. from works that are well known
and then, went to Nature and the details, with them what, in
those
ancient masters, was meritorious in Amposition, attitude and-chiaroseuro, and brought away,
to the best of their ability-superadding it to, and blending it with, the above-accuracy of
detail.
