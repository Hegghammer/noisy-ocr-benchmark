orgy, except to call them fiends incarnate: and who is the bold man who
can guarantee that these same fiends incarnate have become metamorphosed
and changed all of a sudden : or that the handful of liberal Turks at C1.
stantinople are capable of controlling and restraining them. We an ing
even heard that the leaders and participators of the last Optices have
been punished as they deserved : and what is the face they are left un-
punished because the Government is afraid to punish Mahommedans for
killing because the liberal Turks dare not punish the "true

The of Mahommed, the religion of the sword, has been infused
into the Turk, and to understand the effect of the religion of Mahommed
upon the Turk, it is necessary to regard it from four aspects, or from four

loathsomely maltreated by the Turk, and yet in all the agonizing years when
Massacre has succeeded upon Massacre, has there been one kyovn
one single instance of a Turkish weman or child maltreated by
The last massacres though especially organ from the Pala

Constantinopic were officially announced to originate from an affray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed one of the three
given equal numbers and arms, the Armenian is always a match for the
wnmm
Turk, but alas for him that unequal numbers and want of arms have alvays
made him the of his oppressor.
If
Bey in the first part (Ses Causes) of his book ** La Crise de
L'Orient published in Paris in 1907 holds a brief for his nation which
through its own fallacious arguments falls to the ground. I will quote one
passage as an example.
