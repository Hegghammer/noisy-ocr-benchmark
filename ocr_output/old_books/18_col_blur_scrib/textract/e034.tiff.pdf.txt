tassel of g pld, were surmounted by gold anklets or bangles, which, as
well as the bracelets encircling the wrist, sparkled with rare gems; and
necklaces of gold or of beautiful beads, with a pendant of amethysts or
pearls, hung from the neck. Almost every finger was jewelled, and the
ring finger in particular was usually allotted several rings, while massive
carrings shaped like hoops, or sometimes taking the form of a jewelled

fauteuil afforded easy and inviting seats; and the lotus and papyrul
were on the walls. Besides the brazen mirror, other acces-
sories n b toilet were arranged on the ebony table, and boxes and
