Profact.--Introduction:
This book is mainly what those who have kindly furnished records
and sketches have made it. The whole has been carefully compiled.
But genealogical works, almost of necessity, contain many efrors.
Doubtless this small work has its full share. But when em ars
cortinat
covered, notice thereof should be given, so that a second antion may
for
be made casirely truthful. Thankful to all who have generously given
their this work is sent out as a small contribution to the
genenlogical literature of the day, and in the hope that a more full
and extennive book of Horton chronicles may be issued at no very
distant day.
to Jan., 1876.
