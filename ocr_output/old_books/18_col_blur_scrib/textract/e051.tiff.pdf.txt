dillerences of opinion have existed among writers as to the origin of the
word corset. Some are of opinion that the French words corpt, the
body, and uerrer (to tightly inclose or incase), led to the adoption of
the term. Madame La Sante gives it as her opinion, however,

corsets, may have been thus corrupted. This is scarcely probable, as
the word corset was in use at too early of that origin.
