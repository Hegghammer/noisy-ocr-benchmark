THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.

having only her kirtle upon her back. John Gower, howerin 1.10
wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus desa company of
ladies. They were, says he, "clothed all alike, in kinles with rich capes
or mantles pati-coloured, white, and blue, embroidered all over with
various device " Their bodies are described as being long and small,
and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though each of them
had been a queen. We find that the tight-laced young ladies of the
court of the Lady Triamore "had mantles of green-coloured velvet,
hand jomely bordered with gold, and lined with rich furs, Their heads
were neatly attired in kerchiefs, and were ornamented with cut work and
richly-striped wires of gold, and upon their kerchiefs they had each of
them a pretty coronal, embellished with sixty gems or more;' and of
their pretty mistress it is said in the same poem, that her cheeks were as
red as the rose when it first blossoms. Her hair shone upon her head
like golden wire, falling benearn a crown of goid richly ornamented with
precious stones. Her vesture was purple, and her mantle, lined with white
grmine, was also elegantly furred with the same. The Princess Blanche,
the daughter of Eduard III., the subject of the annexed illustration,
appears to have copied closely the dress above described, and, like the
maids of honour of the Lady Triamore herself, she is not only gichly
habited but thoroughly well-laced as well. Thus we see, in AFB the var
361, the full influence of the corset on the costume of that Cridd.
There is another poem, said to be more ancienty mai even Launfal,
which, no doubt, served to give a tone and direction 10 the fashiens of
times following after. Here we find a beautiful lady described as
wearing a splendid girdle of beaten gold, embellished with rubies and
emeralds, about her middle small.
Gower, tox when describing a lover who is in the act of admiring
his mistress tous writes:
*He seeth hir shape forthwith, all
Hir bodye round, hir middle small."
