During a period extending over thirty years the in world has
heard of Turkish Massacres of Armenians facters of a nature so
ferocious and diabolical, so hidcous and revolting, that no pen could adequate
ly describe wor horrors
Writing in 1896, Mr. James Bryce, in his supplementary chapter to the
4th editics of his book: ** Transcaucasia and Ararat' makes the following
grave comment -
" Twenty years is a short space in the life of a nation. But these
