was Dorn in Yorktown, Westchester County, New York, 15
September, 1806. My parents were farmers, in moderate circum-
stances. 1 remained with them until 1 was seventeen, working on the
farm in the summer, and going to school in the winter, thus acquiring
merely a common-school education When 1 was seventeen years old,
at the or my parents, 1 decided to learn the blacksmith
trade, and commenced the business at once, and served an appren
ticeship for several years. On the 17th of October, 1827, I married
Phebe Tompkins, and on the 9th of March, 1820, we moved to Peels
kill village, where we have resided ever since. I bought some pro-
perty, and set up the blacksmithing business. 1 succeeded well in the
business In the spring
ness with Mr. Truman Minor, under the firm name of Minor & Hor-
Z
ton," and went into the foundry business, manufacturing agricultural
implements, principally plonghs and plough-castings. Our business
increased rapidly, the well. We continued partners for
twenty years. In 1855 Mr. Minor retired from business, and 1 took
in Mr. Geo. W. Depeu as a partner, and about two years afterwards,
we admitted each of us a son, and the firm then became, Horton,
Depeu & Sons." Our manulactured articles were sold in nearly every
Nr
State in the Union, and also in many foreign countries.
In 1862 we all sold out to a stock company, formed
that pur-
pose. Having been in active business for thirty years,
