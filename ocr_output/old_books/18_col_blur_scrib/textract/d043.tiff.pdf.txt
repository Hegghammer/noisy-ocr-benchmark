CHAPTER III

HATE AND LOVE
A
LINE certainly did not belong to any ordinary
type and she would have puzzled the psyehol-
ogist to elassify. She was so many sided as to
be in a class by herself. She had plenty of commou
sense and intelligenee for her years and an outlook
montially fair minded and just. But she also had a
quit hauteur, euriously coupled with humility, and at
the same time a winning manner that was irresistible;
so that the strange thing was that she had only to ask
and most people voluntarily submitted to her desires.
This unusual power might have been very dangerous
to her character and spoiled her, had it not been that
what she wanted was almost always just and reason-
able and-moreoyer she never used her power for her
own benefit. Further, her humble estimate of her own
eapacity for judgment caused her but rarely to exercise
the power at all. In practice it was almost confined
to those cases where a sweet minded child's natuwlikmm
stinet for fair play spes further than the sophistries of
the adult.
She was practically unaware of this power, which
X
was destined to bring her into conflict with Eleanor
Mowbray: nor did she take the least delight, as she might
easily have done, in exercising power for power's sake.
