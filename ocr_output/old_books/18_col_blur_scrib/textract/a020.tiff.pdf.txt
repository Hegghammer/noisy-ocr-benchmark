smell of corpses is in the air, the odor from the carcases of the 'christian
swine" reek in the nostrils of the Turk, he turns away, his jaws dripping with
blood, and rests to couch for a future spring. We have seen that sort of an
end to the tragedy of a tiger's victim : the tiger has eaten his fill, byong
to keep guard over the crunched bones and mangled bits of bloode mesh that
bestrew the earth. So also now there is a residue ob s those that have
served 2.5 the meat and wine of this devil's feast me demons have gorged
themselves over the banquet, and now there are left over the broken remains
of the banquet, he miserable residue homeless and destitute.
Civilized Mations have received a temporary moral shock, like a shock
that spreads from the centre of an explosion : the electric vibration running
far and wide from the scene of the centre of devastation. There are among
these civilized nations generous and ind-hearted people who open their
purse strings : they give money to purchase shelter, food and clothing for
these
ed and hungry beggars, made homeless, naked and
hungry through no fault of their own. But oh ye generous and kind hear
ed people can any power under heaven assuage the heart anguish of this
miscrable residue? Can they be made by any means of human comfritt to
forget the black horrors or recover from the effects of the fires of the hideous
affliction through which they have passed? What is there left for a woman
who has seen with her own ears
me dying cry of her murdered child ? even her reason must give way under
the stress of her anguish. All ye who are mothers, 1 appeal to you, for one
moment to put yourselves in the place of thousands of such mothers, in
whose hearts the
ther's love burns as in yours, and then measure
the depth of their agony.
Generous and kind hearted people who open your purse nings: would
to God I entreat, ye would raise up your voices a) demand that this 1 (cople
slaughter and oppression of a helpless christian race should closel B
to God I entreat, ye would raise up your voices and demand that this
of an industrious, intelligent christian race, robust
in
nind
and
body,
should
be let to live. Would to God 1 entreat, that ye would raise up your voices
and demand for them that security of life and property to which they are
entitled just as equally as all other peoples.
