"Remind me of the second dream that was
considered remarkable," said the King. And the
dwarf said, "The second dream was the Dream of
the Laden Ass."

also those skilled in the signification of dreams
could tell me nothing."
"And yet the dream is plain," said the En-
chanter, looking full into the eyes of the King.
"A laden ass signifies a treasure found - your
dream is of a treasure being brought into your
palace." -

"It is so," said the ancient dwarf with the crown
of scarlet fenthers upon his head. "In dreams an
ass is always laden with treasure."
"And was my third dream?" said the
King.
