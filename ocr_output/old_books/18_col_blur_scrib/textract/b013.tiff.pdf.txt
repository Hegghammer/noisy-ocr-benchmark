CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS
DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES
THAT there has hitherto existed no grood book of Engravings of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the progress of the student in that department of Art, is to be regretted. The talents
of Mr. SCOTT, brought into action by those of GILPIN, COOPER, and the REINAGLES,
have presented the public with excellent representations of the distinguished ornaments of the
turf: the sports of the field, and the habits and mauners of the canine mee, were also duly
honoured: but of the ferocious TIGER tribe, and the lordly LION, Ig extant
that
would bear critical inspection, beyond a few detached nothing like a collection of
figures, whose justness and accurney of fi noton, character, and expression, might be
relied on
Does any reader imagine that the various Etchings which have been performed-chiefly
abroad by Artists of no menn ability, may be considered as exceptions? They are not exceptions
or at best, the number which might be so regarded is but small, and those, for the most part, of
dimensions not accommodated to the drawer of the cabinet, or the shelf of the library.
amm objectiouable on this ground alone. Speaking of them in the aggregate, the
heavier charge lies against them of being insufficient to those of taste and information
which are the ends of Art. Even those after TITIAN and after (the latter of whom has
perhaps painted a greater number than any other of the old masters) are far more deficient in
form, charneter, and expression, than is grenerally supposed or than will be ensily believed, by
those who have not actually compared them with the Lions, Leopards, and Tigers of Nature.
They have been taken too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
Nor is this intended apugn the merits, ns historical or poetical painters, of those distinguished
Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that as a painter of allegory, RUBENS
might consider that strong infusion of haman form, charactor and expression, by which his Lions,
for example, are distinguished, as necessary, or conducive, hi purposes or, it is pos-
sible that his knowledge of this animal may not meybeen moroughly well-grow lefl, and
that
he
may have Inboured under early prejudice of mind, or of vision, in this part of his education as a
Painter, and may not have seen Lions as they really are. This is what th writer is most inclined
to
believe, (though not to insist) : for in treating the subject of Dankel in the den of Lions-
