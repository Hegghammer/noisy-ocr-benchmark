CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

Every artist does best, that which he is best qualified and best disposed to do. In com-
pleting the number of plates that has been found necessary for the Work, Mr. EDWIN LANDSEER
has chosen to proceed toward the same purpose, upon a different principle. He has grone, without
any introductory medium, directly to the living animals, and has exhibited the savage manners and
habits of these quadrupeds, according to his own idens and observations.
On the distinction between CHARACTER and EXPRESSION, we shall now deliver our opinion.
By the Character of an animal, we mean those permanencies of his look and features which he
always offers to view when in a placid, or unimpassioned state by his Expression, the variations

obliterate, character. Individuality consists of it, as far as concerns trauce and

THERE is much Character, and little Expression, in the reposing Leopard with his sheathed
claws, which is shewn in the present engraving, copied by Mr. SPILSBURY from RIDINGEH, and
corrected from Nature. RIDINGER was an artist of pover, who studied wild animals in
