CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
and carnivorous habits. They walk on their toes: yet not 80 much from that habitual stealthiness
of pace, by which they advance unperceived till within a spring of their prey as because it is also
the means of that celerity of motion which is necessary to the very existence of animals that can
fleed only on flesh.
Their claws are exceedingly powerful; and they are enabled to draw them up into sheaths
between their toes, so as to prevent their points from touching the ground; whence they are
called retractile; and those claws are, in consequence, always kept sharp, unworn, and ready for
active service.
The eyes of the Feline tribe- - of every face in nature a striking and important feature-vary
in the different species, and are capable of much alteration in the same animal as instinctive
impulse, or internal emotion, changes the expression of his countenance; and also from the
degrees of light which act upon their pupils. Of Lions the pupils of the eyes are circular, and
not of a yellow colour, as has been stated in the most diffuse modern dissertations on the

The Tiger, on the contrary, his prey by day as well as by night; and during twilight the
four of his eyes is that of a blue-green flame. If a stranger passes near a Tiger in a menagerie,
the colour of the animal's eyes will sometimes alter suddenly, from yellow-green to blue-green;
not from any alteration in the degree of light acting upon them, but from mental excitement, and
from a certain natural facility of expansion and contraction of the eye-pupils.
Hence a characteristic difference betwee n the Lion and the Tiger. The habits of the latter
are diurnal, and he disregards night-fires: the Lion, on the contrary, whose eyes are not calculated
for the glare of day, cannot bear to encounter fire-ligh al night. Yet these physical conforma-
tions are sometimes overcome by the rage of hunger; and hence, in Mn. EDWIN LANDSEER's
contending group, the Lion is represented as attacking the Tiger although it be day.
