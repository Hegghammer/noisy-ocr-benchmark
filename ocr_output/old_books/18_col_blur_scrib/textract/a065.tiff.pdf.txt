Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empin
fortunately for themselves have been exempt this super-added evil,
ting
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, geater Crouders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation fair mose lives comprises
murder and robbery, and who have through weary denturies unremittingly
quartered upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits their labour and toil. Indeed as the Hamidich cavalry which
was established expressly for the Hamidian massacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized murder, can now find for those habits in
which they were encouraged and trained to indulge by the Hamidian
régime.

Under all such conditions no hope of better days can be forthcoming
no prospect of better times seems possible, for that unhappy portion of The
Armenian race whom force of circumstances keeps on the soil or
the
fatherland.
The appointment of Christian governors over the provinces in-
habited by them might alternative,
allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespective of creed or
nationality, would furnish some means of self-defence against the raids
and barbarities of the oppressors; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christian persant subject to Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his enemies, must remain one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Not the most fertile
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, can VEB, pring
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the nos assiduous
happiness, and security of life and property, which law of all civilied
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer and
the
of
the
soil.
