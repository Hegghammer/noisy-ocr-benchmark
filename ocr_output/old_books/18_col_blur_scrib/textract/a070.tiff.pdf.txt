L'AVENIR
In the foregoing pages I have directed my humble efforts to sketch out
what Europe have done in the past, and how their actions
have reflected on my unfortunate race.
It is considered good policy now by a certain class of European
to ascribe all the horrors of the Armenian Massacres to Hamid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as unassailable and unconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as a sort of superhuman being who swept everything
before him to the consummation of his own despotic will The reason for
this is not difficult to perceive. They would fain disavow the part Europe
has played in the tragedy, and to do this successfully it becomes necessary
also to present Turkey to the world now as a paradise (from whence the
tyrant once removed) peopled only by saints and angels so we have also
many roseate colored word pictures of Constitutional Turkey.
The murders, deportations and imprisonments of the revolu-
tionaries, or more correctly reformers, were undoubtedly me/sole wors
Abdul Hamid and his palace clique, but Abdul and his B1 not
have carried out that hellish work of whold extermination
the
Armenians without the perpetration and proticibation of the Turkish
people. It is true the massacres were originated and organized in the
Palace, the Palace clique stirred up religious fanaticism and race hatred, Aut
the co-operation of the people was minim the people co-ogerated
in order to plander and enrich thenselves with the worldly goods that the
Armenians allays knew how to acquire by their own industry and toil
the
appeal to marauding and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
