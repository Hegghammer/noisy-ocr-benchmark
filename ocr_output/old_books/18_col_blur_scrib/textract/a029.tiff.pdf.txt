THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN
ating
Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe x the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the famore famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenial nation stands without
its paraliel in ampry.
In
the at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of Europe,
but in the interests of Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin written in letters of blood
(Armenizo mmm blood).

an Armenian General: that although Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to soldiers foucht conquered and
zl. yet by these successes not only was no amelioration attained of the

Ard fate of their unhappy nation under Turkish rule, but that fate, hard
was made a hundredfold and even a thousandfold harder.
