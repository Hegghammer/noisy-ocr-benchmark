Further in answer to Ahmed Riza Bey's account of the Armenian
** prétendus patriotards in connection with the Ottoman Bank : I cannot do
better than quote from Mr. Bryce's version of the story, and massis
that followed : In the following June serious trouble arose au Niere
some sort of insurrection is said to have been planned thous 111 the discre-
pancy of the accounts it is hard to arrive at the tr fir Masses of Kurds
came down threatening to massacre the Christians, and a conflict in which
many innocer rsons perished, was with difficulty brought to an end by
the intervention if the British Consul. A little later the Armenian revolu-
tionary party, emboldened by the rising in Crete, where the Christians, being
well armed and outnumbering the Muslims, held their ground successfully,
issued appeals to the Embassies and to the Turkish Government to introduce
reforms, threatening disturbances if the policy of repression and massacre
was
persisted in. These threats were repeated in August, and ultimately,
M

soon after the attack on the Bank that it had obviously been prearranged,
and the precaution had been taken to employ the Turkish ruffians in different
quarters from those in which they dwelt : so that they might la dasily be

action throughout won general approval) ford the Sultan he would and
British sailors, the Ambassadors telegraphed to the Sultan. Then the

city during the next few days. The Ambassadors, who did not hesitate
