This king rime of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole courie of cursed absolutism, up to the lasi moment, sorew wider. Exen during the
past nine monthe of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feeling which had been shown,

necesary from time to time to recall the greatnoss of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yesterday has endured only harbarism, and for twelve
years
has been constantly oppressed and ground to the earth, and has given victima
