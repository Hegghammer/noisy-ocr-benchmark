of the Porte have been unreasonably forgotten or neglected They are fully
as wretched as the Slavs or Cretans have been : and in so far worse off,
that in Europe there exists no large body of tribes making murder and
robbery its regular and daily occupation as the Kurds, and latyrili mg
Cireassians also, have done in Armenia. If anyone will take he trouble to
read the complaints of oppressions and cruelties Cassied to the Porte by
the Armenian Patriarchate in 1872 (since reprinted in England) and some of
the more statements printed by the Armenians in England on the
same toglic. he will see that the state of Turkish Asia presents as grave and
pressing profelem as that of Bulgaria itself."
In the 4th edition of the same book published in :896, the following
note appears to the passage I have quoted:
Shortly after this was written, the Blue Books presented to Parlia-

What has followed since 1876 is too well known. For seeking Vares edress

reform party first rose in power, and nine months after the inauguration of
the Constitution. I do not question the goodwill of the reform party, but
the reform party does not comprise the whole Turkish until the
Turk learns to become liberal, civilized and human, more
Armenians left, unless some Christian Power such as the United States
!
demands their protection and enforces it. No
thy
Christian
friends,
it
can
be well for other Christians in the Turkish Emaire with their powerful
Governments at their back : but alas! there is no security for a subjest
people alien in race and religion.
The massacres in April last mlhninh to Alexandretla, and
according to Juthenticated reports about fifty thousand men, women and
J
children werymideously exterminated : more than this, the last
were especial characterized by the most hideous, the most loathsome, the
most revolting and ferocious cruelties perpetrated on women and children.
Now what other name can we find for the perpetrators of this diabolical
