than over a half a century; and lastly Jonathan G. Horton, about a
half a century; making in all two hundred and thirteen years at the
death of Jonathan G. Horton, 3 July, 1873- These six genegitions
all living and dying in the old mansion Could those old re-
forein
echo all the words ever spoken there, and exhibit anew all the scenes
ever
witnes book containing such a record would vastly
exceed in volumg the size of the old castle. It would bring to light
much that lum in darkness, and must forever remain hidden from
the generations of the living.
At the death of Jonathan G. Horton, the old homestead became,
by will, the property of the Rev. Mrs. Williams, of Brooklyn, N. Y.,
who was the adopted daughter of Jonathan G. Horton, he never
havin
mmm at on the gd of July, 1873. the old homestead
went out of the Horton name.
Mrs. Williams proposes to sell it, and if some of the Hortons do
not bay it, it will indicate a lack of decent respect for the old castle,
if not for the Horton name. It should be bought back into the
Horton name, suitably repaired and preserved for the wonder and
admiration of generations
Horton, the short, thick man, and Stuart T. Terry, are the two men
Z
seen in the engraving, in front of the old house.
