her custom when she lay awake, amused hereif
by building castles in the air. Sometimes she would
imagine herself as a great lady, sought after by all the
noble knights of the land, but holding herself aloof with
reserved dignity until one, by some deed of unusual
distinctiOg42Otd win her favour. As a rule, however,
this seemed rather a dull part to play, though there was
something naturally queenly in her nature, and she
would therefore prefer something more active. She

its imaginary deeds of heroism, ministered just as much
to her sense of exaltatinn” To-night had opened vistas
of new suggestion ; and she pictured her knight and her-
self fleeing before a boat of enemies and miraculoudy
disappearing at the critical moment into the seeret room.
But at last she fell into a sound slumber and did not
wake till it was nearly time for the morning meal. O
