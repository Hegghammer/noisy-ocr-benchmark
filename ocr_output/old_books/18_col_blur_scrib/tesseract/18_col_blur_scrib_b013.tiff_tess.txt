CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS,
DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.
Twat there has hitherto existed no good book of Engravings of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the progress of the student in that department of Art, is to be regretted. The talents
I of Mr. Joux Scorr, brought into action by those of Grtrtx, Coorer, and the RetxaGuEs,
have presented the public with excellent representations of the distinguished ornaments of the
turf: the sports of the field, and the habits aud manners of the caning race, woe also duly
honoured: but of the ferocious TicER tribe, and the lordly Lio, af(ha extant that

or at best, the number which might be so regarded is but small, and those, for the most part, of
dimensions not accommodated to the drawer of the cabinet, or the shelf of the library.

who have not actually compared them with the Lions, Leopards, and Tigers of Nature.
They have been taken too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
Nor is this intendedLtoimpugn the merits, as historical or poetical painters, of those distinguished
\ Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that as a painter of allegory, Runexs
might consider that strong infusion of Auman form, cha: , afd expressi: which his Lions,
for example, are distinguished, as necessary, or =e 3 OF, it is pos-
