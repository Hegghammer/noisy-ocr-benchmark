8 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

the position of the head. In all gramnivorous animals, the skin of the head is closely attached to
the skull, and eapable only of very limited motion: the eye is almost uniformly mild, and the lips
unmoved by passion.

“ It is in carnivorous animals, with whose habits and manner of life, ferocity is instinctively
connecttd, as the great means of their subsistence, that rage is distinguished by the most
remarkable strength of expression. The eye-ball is terrible, and the retraction of the flesh of the
lips indicates the most savage fury. Dut the first, is merely the exerted attention of the animal ;
and the other a preparatory exposure of the canine teeth. The great animals of prey —the Lion
and the Tiger—are quite inenpable of any other expression of feature, than this particular display
of ferociousness. When they fawn upon their keeper, there is no motion in their features that
indicates affection.”

In this assertion, that the countenances of the great animals of prey are incapable of any
other than ferocious expression, we do not quite coincide, Sen physiologist. When
they fawn upon their keeper, we think that ipdinae are exhibited; and find
ourselves ready to ask what else iggttExpression is that “licking of the hand” which our
iuthor has before mentioned. <&f, however, we should grant that they may not be capable of
aectionate expression toward their keeper, we can scarcely doubt that—toward their young—if

¢ could observe them in their wild state, and in their moments of playful intercourse and
enjoyment among each other—they are: at least, we think there are motions in their features that
indicate affection, as well as fear, enquiry, surprise, gratitude, pleasurable wantonness, and some
other sentiments, or emotions. This is our conviction: at the same time, we perceive that the
eNer\range of their ferocious expression far exceeds the oil fo of their domestic charities. Are
not even the least of these observable in the habits and|m/mners of the domestic Cat, who belongs
to the Tiger genera? Dut we have even seen a Tiger iNhis den, who looked good-natured enough
to be stroked and patted: and of the Lion, of whom Mu. Guirriti relates the following anecdote,
