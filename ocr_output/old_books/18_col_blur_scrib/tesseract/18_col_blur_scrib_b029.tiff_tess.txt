CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. 7
att opposite theory, in which instinctive agency is rejected, and the appearances are explained from
& consideration of the necessities and voluntary exertions of the animal. With regard to the
observer, it has been asserted, that it is by experience alone that he distinguishes the signs of the
passions ; that we learn, while infants, to consider smiles as expressions of kindness, because they
are secompanied by acts of beneficence and by endearmeuts; and frowns as the coutrary, because
we find them followed by blows ; that the expression of anger in a brute, is only that which has
been observed to precede his biting ; and that of fondness, his fawning and licking of the hand.
With regard to the creature itself, it is said, what has been called the external signs of passion, are
merely the concomitants of those voluntary movements, which the passions or habits sugyest ; that
~ the glare of the Lion's eye, for example, is the consequence of a voluntary exertion to see his prey
more clearly —his grin, or snarl, the natural motion of uncasing his fangs before he uses them.
This, however, is not quite true of all animals and of all expression of passion.”

“ Attending merely to the evidence furnished by anatomical investigation, hat I shall

venture to affirm is this: that a remarkable difference is to be CG ony

s range of expression, in man and in animals : in the, fye seems to be a systematic
provision for that mode of communication language, which is to be read in the
tenance: that there is 09 emotion in the mind of man which has not its

i ‘o serve as the organs of this language: that, on the other hand, there is in the lower
animals no range of expression which is not fairly referable as a mere accessary to the voluntary
or needful actions of the animal; and that this accessary expression does not appear to be in any

“There appears to me (continues Mx. Bet) to be no ex jo if the face of any animal
lower in the scale of being than quadrupeds; and in them the and most marked
