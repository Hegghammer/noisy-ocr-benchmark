THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE, 39
Oriental figure of speech, is said to have been ‘ravi y |
of her sandals.” Like the belles of Egypt she did not in, in setting = |
of her to have recourse to perfumes and cosmetics, and
ree she ‘anointed herself with precious ointment.’
lo Jezebel is said to ‘paint her eyelids ;’ and Solomon, in
the Proverbs, in describing the deceitful woman, adjures his son not to
be ‘taken with her cyclids,’ evidently alluding to the use of collyrium. |
The Jewish beauty owed no slight obligation to her luxuriant tresses,
which xe despre! with waving plumes and strings of pearls; and
in allusion to this custom, followed among the tribes from time imme- |
morial, St. Paul affirms that ‘a woman’s ornament is her hair.’ Judith (Yo
*braided the hair of her head and pet a tire upon it,’ and the headdress
| of Pharaoh’s daughter, in the Canticles, is compared by Solomon to |
Carmel, No mention is made of Judich’s mirror, but, it was yadoubtedly
of brass, like those desxribed in Exodus xxxvili, 8 as ‘the
looking-glasses of the women which assembled at the door of the
of the congregation.’”
