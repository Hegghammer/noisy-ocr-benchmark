WHY AND Te

In maki udy of my race, I have found three marked characteristics
inetigene For) —Init Combined with these three characteristics
is an i of Nationality. We live in a complex world. In an
independent people these characteristics and this sentiment are laudable
Virtues. In a subject people they are Crimes.

After I had laid this bitter Truth to heart, I did not have to seek for the
Why andWiarerct the Armenian Massacres.

The Armenian Massacres stand without their parallel in history. |

christian people are to-day in the same deadly peril as they have been since
the famous Treaty of Berl Yeast ih Bode Tate ttt foot to the

of their executioners.

Armenians may be led again “as sheep to the slaughter” and the
work of exterminatios—may—be completed—Jesus Christ was crucified on
Calvary and the servant is not greater than his Lord—but the work of their
extermination can only be completed when the evil influences in urkish
Empire have reached their culminating point. Hitherto
Europe have by their jealousies and rivalries cultiva evil /
they five wate=x! them and made them gow, toh culminating °
point is reached, they must react on and the natural
consequence must follow. Those who sow the wind, must reap the whirl-
wind. It is in the natural order of things~_-_,_..-_-

The question therefore resolves itself into this critical point: “ What will
Christendom do even now?”
