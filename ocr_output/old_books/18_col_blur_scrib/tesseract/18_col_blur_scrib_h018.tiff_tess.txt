it cighteen inches from the grouml, on a good sone
ta Toa oe was of brick, bet it had all crambled down
many year! The present tue was pat ander the stome at the

The imeription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads ax
follows :

“Dhewe Beth barbed the beefy of Ma. Massanae Homo, whe was berm af
Momel TANT SG ingame, amd diet at Nouthobl, om the ayth day of
Jely, 1680, aged So years.”

In the centre of the stone we fied the Epitaph, as follows:

upon the stone before he died. He was the only ope of the qriginal
thirteen who his tombatone with him, and this Get scems to
