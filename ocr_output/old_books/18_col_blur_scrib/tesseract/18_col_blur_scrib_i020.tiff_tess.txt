Friday noon (May 7) we made only 462 miles.
This was partly accounted for by the fact that
we picked up Greenwich time at Cape Clear
and put the clock ahead 1 hour and 40
minutes.

| The reason this small run impressed itself
upon my mind was that I expected that
when we sighted the Irish Grastthe*bexqee nS
eee

should go flying up at not less than 25
miles an hour. Therunrup to Thursday noon
(May 6) had been 486 miles, and so confident
was I that she would put on steam that I
bought the high number in the pool (for
Friday), which was 499. Tt was the only pool ©
I went into and I couldn't help it, for the
number sold at £3.0.0 and at that price it
looked like a “bargain.”
