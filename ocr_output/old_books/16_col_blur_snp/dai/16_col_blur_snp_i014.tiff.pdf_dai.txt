THE ZONE
Avert Thy gare, O God, close tight Thine eyes!
Glance down no longer on the ocean foam,
Lest Thou bebold such borrons as can tura
Men's burning hearts to ice, and chill their souls
Keep Thine heart warm and full of charity
That Thou mayst yet be able to forgive,
And pity feed for those who know not when
Restrain Thy wrath, and keep Thine hand in
Smite not, nor bercely thrust without the pale
Those who can dare to strew the ocean waste
With fellow creatures, innocent of wrong.
Forget the studied purpose to destroy;
The launching of the male through the deep;
The shattered hull, the crushed and bleeding forms:
The seething swirl of wreckage, women, men
