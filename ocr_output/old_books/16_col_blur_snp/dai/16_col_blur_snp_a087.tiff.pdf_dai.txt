Since the time of Gregory, Cliristonity is been the national relor
of the Armenians, and they have done to their christian Gath through
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian prople

The cathedral of Etchmiatein lailt by Gregory still stands today, it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, until perhaps
little of the original building may be left, but it still claims to be the church
built by the patron saint of Armenia. I shall here quote a passion from
Historical Sketch of the Armenian Church," written by in Armenian
"Owing to political circumstances the Armenian Patriarchate had at
times to be transferret to metropolises and to other principal towns
Armenia. In the year A.D. 452 it was removed in Dwin, in 993 to Ani
in 1114 to Romklah, and in 1294 to Sis. The Kingdom of Cicia becoming
extinct, and we having no more a kingdom and no longer a capital town, it
was natural and proper to retransfer the See to its ower presinal place as
the entire nation imanimously desired it. Accordingly in the year 141, it
was decided by an ecclesiastical meeting that the seat of the Catholicus should
return to Holy Etchmiatzin, where to this day has been preserved the
proper unbroken succession from our Apostles and from our holy Father,
St. Gregory the Illuminator

the following piece of news
"An Armenian Church pronounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christian era, has been discovered in a fair state of preserva
tion in the neighbourhood of Bash Aparnah
Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light on Armenian history
