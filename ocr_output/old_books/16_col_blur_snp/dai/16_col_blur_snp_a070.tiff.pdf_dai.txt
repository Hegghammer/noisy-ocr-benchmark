victims in thy Vildiz Kiosk, found its way to thy treacherous heart. No
poisoned cup of coffee like the countless cups brewed in thy palaces trickled
down the threat to end thy vampire existence
Thou hast lived Protected from the Nemesis of thy crimes by the
jealousies and rivalries of great powers which thou artfully played one against
another by the combined forces of religion and plunder which thou cunningly
wickled into one. Even so thou livest! Peerless living example in the
civilized twentieth century of the Triumph of Crime
L'AVENIR.
In the foregoing pages I have directed my humble efforts to sketch out
what the Powers of Europe have done in the past, and how their actions
have reflected on my unfortunate race.
It is considered good policy now la certain class of European writers
to ascribe all the horrors of the Armenian Massacres to Hamid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as unassailable and unconquerable as he was
implacaide, in short as a sort of superhuman being who swept everything
before him to the consummation of his own despotic will. The reason for
this is not difficult to perceive. They would for disavow the part Europe
has played in the tragedy, and to do this successfully it becomes necessary
also to present Turkey to the world now as a paradise (from whence the
tyrant once removed) peopled only by saints and angels, so we have also
many roscate colored word pactures of Constitutional Turkey
The murders, deportations and imprisonments of the Turkish revola
tionaries, or more correctly reformers were undoubtedly the sole work of
Abdul Hamid and las palace clique but Abdul and les mons could not
Armenians without the perpetration and participation of the Turkish
people. It is true the massacres were originated and organized in the
Palace, the Palace clique stirred up religious fanaticism and race hatred, but
the co-operation of the people was necessary and the people co-operated
in order to plunder and enrich themselves with the workily goods that the
Armenians always knew how to acture by their own industry and toil, the
appeal to their maranding and bestial instincts met with a ready response
It was moreover easy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
