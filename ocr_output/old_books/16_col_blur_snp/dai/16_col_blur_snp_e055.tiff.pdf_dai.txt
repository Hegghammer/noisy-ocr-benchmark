THE COREET AND THE CRINOLINE
having only her kirtle upon her back, John Gower, however, who
wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, that describes a company of
ladies. They were, says he, "clothed all afike, in kirtles with rich capes
or mantles, parti-coloured, white, and blue, embroidered all over with
various devices." Their bodies are described as being long and small,
and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though each of them
had been a queen. We find that the tight-laced young ladies of the
court of the Lady Triamore "had mantles of green-coloured velvet,
handsomely bordered with gold, and fined with rich furs. Their heads
were neatly attired in kerchiefs, and were omamented with cut work and
richly-striped wires of gold, and upon their kerchiefs they had each of
them a pretty cozonal, embellished with sixty gems or more," and of
their pretty mistress it is and in the same poem, that her cheeks were as
red as the ruse when it first blousons. Her hair thone upon her head
like golden wire, falling beneath a crown of gold richly ornamented with
precious stones. Her venture was purple, and her mantle, lined with white
ermine, was also clegantly furred with the same. The Princess Blanche,
the daughter of Edward III, the subject of the ancesed slustration,
appears to have copied closely the dress above described, and, like the
maids of honour of the Lady Triamore herself, she is not only richly
habited but thoroughly well-laced as well. Thus we see, in the year
1361, the full influence of the conset on the costume of that period.
There is another poem, said to be more ancient than even Lawnfal,
which, no doubt, served to give a tone and direction to the fashicra of
times following after. Here we find a beautiful lady described as
wearing a splendid girdle of beaten guld, embellished with rubies and
Gower, too, when describing a lover who is in the act of admiring
his mistress, thus writes
