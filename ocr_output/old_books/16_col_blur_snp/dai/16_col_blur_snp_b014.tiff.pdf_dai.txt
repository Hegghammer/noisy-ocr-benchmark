CARNIVOROUS QUADEUPEIS.

rocky cavern-bis animals partake of the artificial character of which we cannot bring ourselves to
of this fact, however, we purpose to exhibit proof with our assertion. Improved versions, to
the best abilities of our Artists, of some of these Lions of RUKENS and the Assyrian king, will here
be introduced, which the reader, who pleases, may compare with the originals. Our second, third,
The Lions of Reness are humanized. We do not intend to discuss at leagth whether the
ideality of allegorical pointing required this: we only state the fact: yet the opinions which we

made them well. There is a profission of flowing and curling hair, which seems rather to solicit
the unguents of the perfinner, than to have endured the torrid beats of the desert, or the rough
storms of the forest. The shag of a Lion's rape is a very different sort of thing.
However such dressed Lisos y be thought to accord with Allegory, they are demonstrably
at variance with Nature. To be sure, what might become a Lion in the procession of the Cardinal
Virtues might be rather unsuitable in his den, or within the precincts of those wild haunts, where he

Ausing the oleervers of this poetic improvement, or this natural and unpoetical deficiency, on
the part of Rurss, TITIAS, JULIO ROMANO, and other painters, both ancient and modern; and
of the consequent desiderate on the part of the public, of a cabinet or libenry collection of the
nobler wild animals in a state of Nature, so pa to muswer the parposes of reference, while they con-
duced to the pleasures of Taste, were Mr. EboaR SPILSBURY and Mr. THOMAS LANDSEER.
Whether or not the pablie looked up to them for light" on that subject, (to use the language of
STERNE) they thought the Public" deserved it," and they therefore, as the best practical means
of eliciting that light, first copied the general forms and attitudes of most of the wild animals that
appear in this book, from the old masters-generally speaking, from works that are well known
and then, went to Nature and corrected the details. They carried with them what, in those
ancient masters, was meritorious in composition, attitude and chiaroscuro, and bronght away,
to the best of their ability-superadding it to, and blending it with, the above-accuracy of
