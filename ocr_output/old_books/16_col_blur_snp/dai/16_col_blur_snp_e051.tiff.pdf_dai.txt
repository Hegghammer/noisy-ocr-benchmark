Wharton quotes from an ancient poem, which he believes to date as
far back as 1200, in which a lover, speaking of the object of his
admiration, thus throws down the gauntlet of challenge, and exclaims
The word metk or maint being used instead of very or much. Some
word warmt. Some are of option that the French words corps, the
body, and serrer (to tightly inclose or incase), led to the adoption of
the term. Madame La Sante gives it as her opinion, however, that it is
more probably a corruption of the single word corps, which was formerly
written ors, and may be taken as a diminutive form of it. Acother
view of the matter has been that the name of a rich material called
vers, which was at one time extensively used in the manufacture of
corsets, may have been thus corrupted. This is scarcely probable, as
the word corset was in use at too early a period to admit of that origin
Perhaps as early an instance of the use of the term corset as any in
existence may be found as a portion of an entry in the household register
of Eleanor, Countess of Leicester, which bears the date May 24, 1265
