On the field the ever victorious army of little Japan undermined Russia's
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
dekated and ever retreating army of colossal Russia. At sea the ever
victorious Japanese Fleet succeeded in completely anniliating the Russian
The secret of
such astoranding successes should be investigated and here I ber leave to
quote from one of a series of articles in which I gave view to my opinions
during the Russo Japanese War Japan may be likened to the handle of
Lavots in the Bible Semly tied to the one bright of larger dimensions in
the centre the sovereign round who the whole nation clusters, and all
tuber and people tied together by a lamantine bands of patriotism
These remarks of mine were based on olservations of actual facts. In
national unity Japan stands as an object lesson to the world; the furnishes
an example which the workt nests to copy, and which a nation so policeally
forlorn as ourselves more than any other needs to copy,
From the astounding success of Japan let us tam to the position the
Great Republic of the United States of America ocemples in the world, and
take the lesson to heart of what Union can accomplish as we contrast their
present position with the position that the handful of puritan pilgrims occupied
when they first landed on American soll not quite three hundred years ago
National Unity is our greatest need: it is the banner which we must
raise up over our national life. National Unity nest be engraven on the
tablets of our minds and throb in the pulses of our hearts. There are
moont mes of dificulties beiore us and if ever we most reach the cool we
can only do so by being bound together like the bundle of fagents in the
falle, with no weakening or loosening of the bands. Then perhaps we
mecht once more be able to get an independent footing on the historical sol
of our fathers, and perhaps once more rally round our own flag, A Japan
esc-lives for the State, not for hussell, we have no State for which to live
but let us live for our communities whilst we keep the hope in our hearts
that communities grow into States
We have grit and endurance in an unparalleled degree, but these
characteristics will profit us nothing if we are wanting in unity,
Let us remember that utterance of the Founder of our faith In our
loyalty and allegiance to Him our life blood has flowed like the torrents of a
cataract but we must remember is warning utterance
What shall it profit a man? What shall it profit a nation
