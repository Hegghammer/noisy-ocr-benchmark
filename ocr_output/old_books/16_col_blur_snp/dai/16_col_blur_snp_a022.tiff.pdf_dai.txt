of the Porte have been unreasonably forgotten or neglected. They are fully
as wretched as the Savs or Cretans have been and in so far worse off
that in Europe there exists no large body of tribes making murder and
robbery its regular and daily occupation as the Kards, and latterly the
Circassions also, have done in Armenia If anyone will take the trouble to
read the complaints of oppressions and crueities presented to the Porte by
the Armenian Patriarchate in 1872 (since reprinted in England) and some of
