Remember that they know not what they do
Who strike in deadly fear and ghastly hate;
Remember that somehow, and at some time,
Each crime exacts its human penalty,
Are agents of Thy purpose and The plan,
Which work within a deadlier revenge
Than any shrapoel shot or saber thrust
Remember that new generations comme
Upon who fall the burden and the ease.
The anguish of old hatreds and past wrongs,
Restrain, O God, the sweep of this vast hate;
Recall the nations to their sense of shame:
Reveal anew the message of the Christ.
