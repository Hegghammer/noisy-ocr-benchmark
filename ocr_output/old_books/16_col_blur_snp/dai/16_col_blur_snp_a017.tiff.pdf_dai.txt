at Zetoont. The Rev. E. W Maculum, American Missionary at Marant
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peer, American Missionary at Constantinople, that
12,000 souls in and around Zeitson are dying of hunger, they are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran and water, and cooking and eating it, if they can
get even that Rev. Maculam adds. The same story comes to us from all
we forex all along from now on the distress will be present
of homelessness and starration will exceed 130 noo. It is true and the
numbers are not exagiterated Law year the people reaped no harvest, and
The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered in a protrack
Sumed Kurds, and the villagers are now reduced to extreme distress Before
the outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeatedly appealed
to the Armenian Patnarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protes
tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It is
evident that the authorities at Coastantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
