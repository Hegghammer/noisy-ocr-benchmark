PREFACE TO SD PRINTING
The first and second parts of this little book were written and printed
in pamphlet form for circulation in the United States, shortly after the
Adana Massacres of April, 1909. I have now thought it advisable to add
& Supplement of a short history of the Origin of the Armenians and the
Introduction and Revival of Christianity in Armenia
The illustrations and the extracts from the periodicals Harper's
Monthly The Wide World and the Commopolitan" have been added
