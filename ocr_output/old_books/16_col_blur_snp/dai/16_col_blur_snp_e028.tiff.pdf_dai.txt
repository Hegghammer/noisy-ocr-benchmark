The Persian entertain much the same notions with regard to the
necessity for slenderness of form in the belles of their nation, but differ m
other matters from the Hindoos. The following illustration represents a
dancing-girl of Persia, and it will be seen that her figure bears no
indication of neglect of cultivation. It is somewhat curious that the
Chinese, with all their extraordinary ingenuity, have confined their
restrictive efforts to the feet of the ladies, leaving their waists unconfined,
