AND WHEREFORE
la making a study of my race, I have found three marked characteristics
Intelligence Energy-Industry, Combined with these three characteriace
an intense Love of Nationality. We live in a complex world. In as
independent people these chaincteristics and this sentiment are laudable
After I had last this bitter Thath to heart, I did not have to seek for the
Why and Wherefore of the Armenian Massacres
The Armenian Massacres stand without their parallel in history. The
xunan mind staggers to contemplate the bendish orgies of which they have
the famous Treaty of Berlin consigned them bagod hand and foot to the
mercy of their executioners
The Armenians may be led again as sheep to the slaughter and the
work of extermination may be complted-Jean Christ was crucified on
Calvary and the servant is not greater than his Land-last the work of their
extermination can only be completed when the evil influences in the Turkish
Empire have reached their culmination point Hitherto the Power of
Europe have by their jealousies and rivalries cultivated these evil intluences,
they have watered them and made them grow but when their calminating
point is reached, they must react on Christendom and the natural
consequence must follow Those who sow the wind, most reap the whirl
wind. It is in the natural order of things
I will allow that Liberty, Justice, Equality, I'raternity are the watchwords
of Young Turkey, bat Young Turkey is only a small minority: the great
majority of the Turkish nation are not Young Turks.
The question therefore resolves itself into this conical point. What will
Christendom do even now?"
