THE LUSITANIAS LAST TOYAGE
Friday noon (May 7) we made only 402 miles
This was partly accounted for by the fact that
we picked up Gromwich time at Cape Clear
and put the clock abead 1 hour and 40
minutes.
The this small run impressed itarif
upon my mind was that I expected that
when we sighted the Irid Coast the "Lucy
would show a burst of "top speed." and that
be should go flying up at not less than es
miles an hour. The run up to Thursday noon
(May 6) had been 484 miles, and no confident
was I that ahe would put on stean that I
bought the high number in the pool (for
Friday), which was 409. It was the only pool
I went into and I couldn't help it, for the
number sold at $3.0.0 and at that price it
looked like a *bargain."
Daring the formoon of Thursday (May 6)
we swung out and uncovered et lifeboats, 11
on each side, showing Captain Turner's pres
( 4 )
