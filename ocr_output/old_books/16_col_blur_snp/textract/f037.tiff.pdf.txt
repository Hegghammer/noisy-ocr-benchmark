as the town was named, i.e. the "hill-staple*
or market, and his successors were often there.
The wool market was the most important at
Dunstable w the monks long maintaining great
flocks of sheep on the adjacent downs,
The robber became only to memory, but a
memory that never faded. It merely took on
another form, and in the course of time the name
of the town itself was twisted into an allusion
to thetu and to their leader, It needed the col-
jusion of gruss agnorance and wild legend to effect
so much, but the thing was done. : and for cen-
turios Dunstable was, and perhaps even now is,
locally said to owe its name to *Dun's Stable,"
a hollow in the chalk downs, pointed out having
been the place whore "Dun," the entiraly ima-
ginary leader of the outlaws, stabled his hone.

highway to Bedford, where he met a wasgon full
of corn, going to market, drawn by a fine team
of horws He accosted the waggoner, and in the
midst of contersation stabbed him to the hoart
with a dagger. He buried the body, and drove the
waggon oll to the town, where be sold the com
and the well, and then disappeard
