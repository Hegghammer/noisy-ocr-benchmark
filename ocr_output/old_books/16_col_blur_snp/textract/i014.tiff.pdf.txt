THE ZONE
Avert Thy o God. cleas tight Thine eyes!
Glance down no longer on the foasa.
Lest Thou brhold such borzors ax can tura
Men's borning bearts to ice, and chill their souls.
Keep Thine heart sams and full of charity
That Thou mayst yet be abse to forgive,
And pity forl for those who koon and when
To in deeds of ruthless secrifice.
Restrain Thy wrath, and keep Thine hand in
check;
Sraite not, not Bercely thrust without the paie
Those who can dare to stree the waste
With fellow crotures, innoment of wrong
Forget the studied purpose to destroy;
The launching of the through the deep;
Theshattered hull; the crushed and blending forms;
The secthing wir) of wreckagr. women,
