PROLOGUE
THE HORSES OF KING MANUS
As for the youth who had tried to steal the white
horse that the King owned, be was bound hand
and foot and taken into the castle of the King,
There he was thrown down beside the tresties of
the great table, and the hot wax from the candies
that lighted the supper board dripped down upon
him. And it was told to him that at the morrow's
sunrise he would be slain with the kword.
Then the King called upon one to finish the
story that was being told when the neigh of
the white horse was beard in the stable. The
story could not be finished for him, however,
because the one who had been telling it was now
outside, guarding the iron door of the stable with
a sword in his band. And King Manus, sitting
at the supper board, could not eat nor refresh
himself becauxe there was no one at hand to finish
the story for him.
