THE STORY OF EEAX THE FISHERMAN'S SON
on the ass, and the ass is driven back over the
mountains into the commer that they came from,
these men.
And in such boats we went down the river and
came into Babylon. No city in the world is as
mighty or as wonderful as Babylon. It has three
hundred and sixty-five streets, and in every street
there are three bundred and sisty-five palaces,
and to evers palace there are three hundred and
sixty-five steps leading up to its door of gold and
chony. The streets when came into them
were thronged with mighty, dack-beanded met. I
was much in dread when I in those gratt
strects, and looked on the mighty men who went
throngh them.
In the center of the city were the palace and the
vide-apreading gardens of the King. In those
gardens, as my master told the, were one or two of
all the beautifal or terrible animals of the world.
Those gardens I will speak of again, o King,
for it was within them that I came upon the
danger that war greater than the danger that
I am now in.
