entrusted to hor keeping by a farmer attending
the market. To convince Ratery how trusted
a person she was, she foolishly showed where she
had placed the hag: and as soon as her back was
turned he had taken it from the cupboand where
it lay, and made off.
When the farmer returned and wanted his
money, there wns the very deuce to pay. He and
the landlady went off to the neazest justion and
swore an information against Gamaliel, who was
arrosted and thrown into prison, but not before be
had found time to return home and bury the bag
in the garden. In confidence he told his mother
where it was bid, his mother told his sister, his
sister told her hashand, her husband toid his
friends, and so at last the confession reached the
ears of the justices, Gamaliel would undoubtedly
have been hanged on thust occassion, only he broke
prison and escaped, clad only in his shirt.
His further adventures with Snell and
Shorthose, two companions of like inclination,
are in themselves amusing when reduced to less
stilted language than that of the Lifr. Curiously
enough, one of these incidents is concerned with
the rolibing of an actor, whom Ratery bids deliver
his money first, and a scene from after-

author of Ratery's life failed to put life into
his narmative. The incident is treated in dond
and wooden a manner as the rest.
