Apprenticed to an Enchanter used to begin.

stable. It had double walls of stone; it had oak
beams; it had an iron door with four locks to it.
And before this door two soldiers with drawn

asked bim for a gift the King might not refuse to
give what was asked of him. But King Manus
was hard to como to by those with requests. For
before the clumber where be sat or alept there
stood a servant to take the request. and if it were
one that might not be brought to him. to make an
excuse for the King.
It was all becanse of the King's three horses
a white horse, a red horse, and a black horse.
The white horse was as swift as the planging wave
