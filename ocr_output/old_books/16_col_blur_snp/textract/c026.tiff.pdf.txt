THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
I went in and stood on the floor of our house my
heart was thumping within ane at the thought of
what was before.
And there was the pot boiling over the fire with
a few kreen herbs in it. There was Saba, my
mother, stirring the last handful of neal amongst
the green herbs. And there were my brothers,
all older than 1, sitting by the firc, waiting for
the herbs and the meal to be ready.
When my mother looked toward us she sur the
man from the strange boat. She thought that
some crime had been committed by the or my father
to bring a man of such high degree amongit us.
She and my brothers were greatly afraid, for they
were poor. and those who were high were harsh
to them. But the stranger spoke softly, saying.
"Good fortune has come to you from the sea
to-day.. And when they all torned toward him
be said, "I who am very knowloigrable will take
your son with me as nn apprentice, and I shall
instruct him in arts and crafts and mysteries."
My mother said. The boy is young, and we
thought he would be with us for a time longer.
