I made my way back along the passage,
walking in the angle formed by the Boor
and the side walls of the staterooms rather
than the floor, and went back up the for'ard
companion-way, the same that I came down.
Going along the passage (on deck B) I
looked down some of the cross passages that
lead to the statérooms, and at the bottom of
the ones I passed I saw that the portholes
were open and that the water could not have
bees more than a few feet from them. Here
let me state that I consider it most extraor-
dinary that the portholes on the lower decks
should not have been closed and waled
steamed through the war zone. At Inncheon
the portholes in the dining-saloon on deek
D were open, and sa I doubt not that
all the others on that deck were open.
