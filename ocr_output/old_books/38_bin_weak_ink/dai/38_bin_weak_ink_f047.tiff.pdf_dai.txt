more pleasant to consider the romantic spirit that
evolved him and gave him his exquisite setting
of mossy glades and giant oaks, where the sun
comes in golden-green shafts through the em-
bowering foliage, and you hear the winding of
the hunters' horns in chase of the deer. There
is a springtime gladness in the old verses, of
which this is typical:
Whan shaws bene sheene and shroddes full fayre,
And leaves both large and longe,
Itt's merry walking in the fayre forrist
To hear the small birdes songe.
To se the dere draw to the dale,
And leve the hillës hee,
And shadow hem in the levës grene,
Under the grene-wode tre.
It is the springtime of the and of the
English nation that you glimpse
These lines;
a picture of that larger rural Engla
ssible
adventure, and uncontaminated ski
a thing of the past.
Nature is portrayed in the
vividness and certainty that m ambitious poets
cannot match :
lan
The woodweele sang
wold not cease,
Sitting upon the praye,
Soe lowde, he wakened Robin Hood,
In the greenwood where he lay.
It is versification of the simplest and the most
sincere kind.
Robin Hood, real or imaginary character, has
himself no criminal taint, but he is one of the
VOL. I.
