earth as other nations? Does Humanity, does Christianity allow that tender
babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and butchered
before the eyes of their mothers, or that the ears of mothers should be rent
with the cries of the dying agony of their murdered children? Does
Humanity, does Christianity allow that helpless women should be forcibly
subjected to the most hideous, the most loathsome, the most revolting, and
the most cruel outrages? Does Humanity, does Christianity, allow all this?
Christian Governmen have organized a Hague Conference of Peace
and Civilization, but they ave. closed its doors to the cause of a bleeding
christian race groaning u
the yoke of the cruellest oppressors that the

Christian Powers should be all gahered together, one against another, in the
Empire of your Oppressors, as eagles gather together round a carcase; but
really there is no help for it; and if you must die hideously by a hellish
extermination, why then you must die, and we have to condone your hellish
