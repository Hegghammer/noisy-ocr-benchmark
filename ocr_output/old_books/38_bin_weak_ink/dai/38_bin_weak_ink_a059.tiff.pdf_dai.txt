In simple native the author carries the reader through palling
scenes of horror, and as we read we are made to realize the slaughter of
the enemy's machine guns, of their ground-mines, electric-wire entangle-

For the grim warrior's heart is cleft in twain for the human bullets that
under his command hurled themselves to their death.
