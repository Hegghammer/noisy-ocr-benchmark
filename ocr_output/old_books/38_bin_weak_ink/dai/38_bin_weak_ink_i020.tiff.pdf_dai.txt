THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
Friday noon (May 7) we made only 462 miles.
This was partly accounted for by the fact that
we picked up Greenwich time at Cape Clear
and put the clock ahead 1 hour and 40
minutes.
The reason this small run impr itself
upon my mind was that I expel
when we sighted the Irish Coast the
would show a burst of "top speed" al
we should go flying up at not less th
miles an hour. The run up to Thursday
(May 6) had been 484 miles, and so confic
was I that she would put on steam that
bought the high number in the pool (fc
Friday), which was 499. It was the only pool
I went into and I couldn't help it, for the
number sold at £3.0.0 and at that price it
looked like a "bargain."
During the forenoon of Thursday (May 6)
we swung out and uncovered 22 lifeboats, 11
on each side, showing Captain Turner's pre-
( 4 )
