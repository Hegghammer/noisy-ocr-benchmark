peg. This operation is repeated until all holes have been
utilized on the two parallel rails, except those on the corners.
Thruout the seven operations it is necessary that the cane be ke'
from twisting by drawing the remaining part of the strand th
thumb and forefinger.
Step 2. The second step is identical with the first, with the dif-
ference that the other two parallel rails are used, and that the
canes run over the first set of paralle!
canes. If the first strand of cane ha
not been entirely used up in the first
step, the remainder is used to begi
the second step.
Step 3. This step is a repetition of the first two. The canes o
this series run over the first and second series and parallel with th:
first. As each strand is used up bind the end by pulling it under
a cane, crossing from one hole to another underneath the frame
and cutting off about ¼/4 in. from the cane. Fig. 5 shows how this
binding is done. The loose end at the starting point is tied in thi
way, and all subsequent ones should be tied as they come, thu
avoiding interference by many pegs, and insuring neat binding.
Step 4. The actual weaving begins with this step. It may b
done entirely by hand, without resort to the needle, but it is sloy
work. The needle should be used. Start at a hole next to a con
on either rail that has been used but once, working from can
toward the open frame. Go over and under the strands
to form the weave, turning the needle from side to side 1

the end down thru the hole, pairing the canes.
Pull the cane à
thru the next hole; then start the needle from the opposite side of
the frame and repeat the first operation, thus pairing another set
of canes. Continue until all canes are paired and all holes used.
Soak the woven cane with a wet sponge, and with two pegs
straighten the strands of cane and force all pairs together. Small,
