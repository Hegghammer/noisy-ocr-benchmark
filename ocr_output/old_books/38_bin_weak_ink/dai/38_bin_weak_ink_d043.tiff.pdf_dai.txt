CHAPTER III
HATE AND LOVE
A
LINE certainly did not belong to any ordinary
type and she would have puzzled the psychol-
ogist to classify. She was so many sided as to
be in a class by herself. She had plenty of common
sense and intelligence for her years and an outlook
essentially fair minded and just. But she also had a
quiet hauteur, curiously coupled with humility, and at
the same time a winning manner that was irresistible;
so that the strange thing was that she had only to ask
and most people voluntarily submitted to her desires.
This unusual power might have been very dangerous
to her character
iled her, had it not been the
what she wanted was
just and reas
able and moreover she new
own benefit. Further, her humb
capacity for judgment caused her but
the power at all. In practice it was an
to those cases where a sweet minded child's na
stinct for fair play sees further than the sophistries
the adult.
She was practically unaware of this power, which
was destined to bring her into conflict with Eleanor
Mowbray; nor did she take the least delight, as she might
easily have done, in exercising power for power's sake.
