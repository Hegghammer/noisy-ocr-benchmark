called a powerful nation. For almost as long they have possessed no independent country of
their own.
For six hundred years their ancient capital city of Ani has stood a splendid but
empty ruin in the desert between Kars and the great mountain of Alagöz, which confronts
Ararat, with nearly equal height. They have been rent asunder and tormented by Persians,
Turks, Tartars, and Russians in turn. Even their religion is not nationalistic or distinctly
separate from other forms of religion, like the Jewish. Except for metaphysical shades of
difference, hardly comprehensible to the modern world, there is little to distinguish it
orthodox Christianity of the Near East. Yet, through innumerable disser
at extermination, the race persists, like the Jews, with astonide
characteristics which may not be exactly heroic, but
all, it is only in harassed and persecuted.
