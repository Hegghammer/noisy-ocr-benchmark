orgy, except to call them fiends incarnate; and who is the bold man who
can guarantee that these same fiends incarnate have become metamorphosed
and changed all of a sudden; or that the handful of liberal Turks at Con-
stantinople are capable of controlling and restraining them. We have not
even heard that the leaders and participators of the last massacres have
been punished as they deserved; and what is the reason they are left un-
punished? because the Government is afraid to punish Mahommedans for
killing Christians; because the liberal Terks dare not punish the "true
believers" for killing â€œKaffirs."
The religion of Mahommed, the religion of the sword, has been infused
into the Turk, and to understand the effe of the religion of Mahommed
upon the Trk, it is necessary to regard rom four aspects, or from four
points of anal First, the fundamental ctrine and law of the religion.
Second, the chara of the founder as a ample to his followers. Third,
the racial and ethnos

In conclusion, I will ask my readers to e one point of difference
between the two races, the oppressor and the ed. Thousands upon
thousands of Armenian women, thousands upon usands of Armenian
children, have been hounded to death, or savagely, te ously, horribly and
loathsomely maltreated by the Turk, and yet in all the aizing years when
Massacre has succeeded upon Massacre, has there been on known case or
one single instance of a Turkish woman or child maltreated by Armenians ?
The last massacres though especially organized from the Palace at
Constantinople, were officially announced to originate from an affray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed one of the three :
given equal numbers and arms, the Armenian is always a match for the
Turk, but alas for him that unequal numbers and want of arms have always
made him the victim of his oppressor.
Ahmed Riza Bey in the first part (Ses Causes) of his book "La Crise de
L'Orient" published in Paris in 1907 holds a brief for his nation which
through its own fallacious arguments falls to the ground. I will quote one
passage as an example.
