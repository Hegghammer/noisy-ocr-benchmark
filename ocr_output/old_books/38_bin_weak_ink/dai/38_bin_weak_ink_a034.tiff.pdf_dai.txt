That the Armenians should be constantly appealing to the Power that
had pledged itself for their protection, and that the same Power should be
constantly rallying the others, and making Ambassadorial demonstrations,
was enough to rouse the vilest passions of a nature in which no feelings
except vile passions existed.
Of all sins in this world, perhaps the sin of foolishness receives the
severest punishment, and of all crimes, the crime of failure meets with the
heaviest doom. For their foolishness in trusting in European protection
and hoping for European intervention the unfortunate Armenians paid with
rivers of their own blood,d for their crime of failure they were made to
wallow in that blood. Takest pages of their history have been written
in the closing years of centh, and the early years of the twentieth
century; never since
their independence, nine centuries ago, had
they hoped for so mu
er had they paid so dearly for their folly.
If they had car
eart the whole history of Europe's inter-
course with Asia, la
conquests of the Macedonian Alexander;
they would have
sober judgement, self-interest, and self-
interest only w
ad page, but they committed the folly of
GENERAL TER GOU KASSOFF.
Relieved the beleaguered Russian garrison
at Bayazid during the Russo-Turkish war of
1877, captured the fortress; and otherwise
distinguished himself during the war.
The other Armenian General who dis-
tinguished himself during the Russo-Turkish
war was General Lazaroff.
