CHAPTER I
CANING; THE SEVEN STEPS
That caning has not been undertaken to any appreciable extent
in school shops is due to the fact that instructors are unfamiliar
with the weaving processes. Caning is not difficult. It, in common
with many other lines of activity, is best learned thru observation.
However, it may be undertaken by the average person after careful
study of printed directions and illustrations. If the worker will
closely observe his own work as it progresses, and follows instruc-
tions carefully, he should have no unusual difficulty in caning an
area very acceptably in the initial attempt. Particular attention
should be paid to directions which tell of errors to avoid. Errors
creep in, in a very unobtrusive manner at times, and the amateur
will find them hard to detect.
