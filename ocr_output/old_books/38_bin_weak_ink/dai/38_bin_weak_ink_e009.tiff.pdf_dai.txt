PREFACE.
THE subject which we have here treated is a sort of figurative
battle-field, where fierce contests have for ages been from time to time
waged; and, notwithstanding the determined assaults of the attacking
hosts, the contention and its cause remain pretty much as they were at the
commencement of the war. We in the matter remain strictly neutral,
merely performing the part of the publis "own correspondent making
it our duty to gather together such e ts from despatch oth ancient
and modern, as may prove interest important
e note of the
vicissitudes of war, mark its var ases, ar
e, to do our best
to lay clearly before our read
experiences and
arguments relating to the r
question."
As most of our reader
ading journals especially
intended for the perusal of
for many years the media
for the exchange of a va
letters and papers touching
the use of the Corset.
ons relating to the history of
this apparently indispensal
e of ladies' attire, its construction,
application, and influence on gure have become so numerous of late
that we have thought, by o odying all that we can glean and garner
relating to Corsets, their wearers, and the various costumes worn by
ladies at different periods, arranging the subject-matter in its due order
as to dates, and at the same time availing ourselves of careful illustration
when needed, that an interesting volume would result.
