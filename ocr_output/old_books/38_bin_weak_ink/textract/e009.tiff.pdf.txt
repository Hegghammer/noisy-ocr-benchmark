PREFACE
THE subject which we have here treated is a sort of figurative
battle-field, where fierce contests have for ages been from time to time
waged; and, notwithstanding the determined assaults of the attacking
hosts, the contention and its cause remain pretty much as they were at the
commencement of the war. We in the matter remain strictly neutral,
merely performing the part of the publ' $ "own correspondent making
it our duty to gather together such e

the use of the Corset.
nons relating to the history of
this apparently indispensal

application, and influence on
gure have become so numerous of late
that we have thought, by e
odying all that we can glean and garner
relating to Corsets, their Avearers, and the various costumes worn by
ladies at different periods, arranging the subject-matter in its due order
as to dates, and at the same time availing ourselves of careful illustration
when needed, that an interesting volume would result.
