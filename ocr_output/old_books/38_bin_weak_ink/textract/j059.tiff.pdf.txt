CHAPTER VI
REED AND SPLINT WEAVING
Reeds which are used extensively for basket-making and weaving
in general are procured from the species of palm described in Chap-
ter I. These reeds should not be confused with the term reed
applied to several distinct species of large water loving grasses.
Such reeds are usually designated under the name of grasses. There
are a thousand species of palm distributed over the tropical regions
of the entire world, but only a few are native in the United States,
and these are of no distinct commercial value. The rattan or canc
palms of India and the Malay Islands grow to an unusual height,
and are imported into this country in gre
auntities. These rat-
tans and the trailing palm of the speci,
mus have as main
export centers Singapore and Calcutta.
ms are stripped
of leaves and bark and split into round
of different
diameters and widths. The outer bark
proper
sizes, is known as chair cane; the entire
noved,
is commercially known as rattan and
sold as flat rattan and pith canc. Ina
strips, split from the palm plant and
rattan are called reeds, we shall refe
all discussions to follow. There a
market sold under the names of Chi
former is inferior in quality and the
tough and durable. The Philipp

ering and marketing the produg

partial survey of the rattan supi
the belief that
the Islands will eventually com
Id market.
