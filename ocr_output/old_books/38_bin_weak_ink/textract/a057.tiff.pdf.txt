thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the feared fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudeuce to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the anuals of Armenian history.
At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nereès, the Patriareh, their object being to request the signatory l'owers of
the Berlin Treaty to force it guarantee from the Turkish Government in make certain
important improvement in Armenia.
Abdul Hamid and
advisers were furious at this affront, and Monseigneur Nercès was
summoned to the Palace

and asked one of of his

return alive. Howeve,

and himself at the int

General Assembly and

ceremonial according to high Turkish etiquette, and it is not unusal for guests to bring their
own tchooboukdar (the servant who carries his master's pipe and pouch and also superintends
the
making of his coffee). The Archbishop was presented with a "tchoobouk" (pipe) tilled
and lighted for smoking, and a servant followed with coffee. The Archbishop necepted hoth
with
due compliments to his host, and took a sip at his coffec. Just at that moment the
heavy curtains over the doorway irere thrown apart, revealing the ghastly pale face of his

This was enough for the Archbishop ; he pretended to be startled and spilt the coffée, but,
alas ! he had already drunk a small quantity of it. Meanwhile a seuflle was going on behind
