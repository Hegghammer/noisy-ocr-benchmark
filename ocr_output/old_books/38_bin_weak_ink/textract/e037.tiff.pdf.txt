THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE,
29
Oriental figure of speech, is said to have been 'ravished by the beauty
of her sandals.' Like the belles of Egypt she did not disdain, in setting
off her charms, to have recourse to perfumes and cosmetics, and
previously to setting out she 'anointed herself with precious ointment.'
In another place Jezebel is said to 'paint her eyelids; and Solomon, in
the Proverbs, in describing the deceitful woman, adjure his son not to
be taken with her eyelids,' evidently alluding to the
of collyrium.
The Jewish beauty owed no slight obligation to her
jant tresses,
which were decorated with waving plumes and strin
earls ; and
in allusion to this custom, followed among the tribe
be imme-
morial, St. Paul affirms that 'a woman's ornament
Judith
braided the hair of her head and put a tire upon it
ddress
of Pharaoli's daughter, in the Canticles, is comp
in to
Carmel. No mention is made of Judith's mirror, b
dly
made of brass, like those described in Exod
e
looking-glasses of the women which assemb
tabernacle of the congregation."
