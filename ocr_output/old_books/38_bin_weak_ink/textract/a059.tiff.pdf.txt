PART II.
OUT OF THE
VEPTIIS.
" Oh that my head were waters an
es a fountain of tears, that
I might weep day and night for the sla
le.'
A book has been written and
its title "Niku Dan"
translated into English, reads,
This little book, a
narrative of the siege of Port
A
through the length
and breadth of the empire,
te it into the best
known of languages ; and it
or in the siege,
was summoned to the pres
ed and praised.
The book is a graphic na
nö'st
tory, wherein
is vividly portrayed the
of the
intains as an
acknowledgement of
a
page on whic
the Field
Marshal's appreciatig
Whother page bearing the Co.
General's
commendation.
In simple the author carries the reader throug!
palling
scenes of horrol; and as we read we are made to realize the slaughter of
the enemy's machine guns, of their ground-mines, electric-wire entangle-
ments, and exploding shells ; we are made to hear the roar of the artillery
fire dealing death and destruction, and there rises before us the mental vision
of the fierce hand to hand conflict, and the dead and dying lying thickly in
the dark ravine.
"For hill and battle plain,
With dying men and slain,
Grew mountain heights of pain,
And mine is boundless woe."
The grim warrior who stormed and took the most impregnable fortress
in the world gives expression to his feelings on his own great achievement,
in saddest words.
"And mine is boundless woe,"
For the grim warrior's heart is cleft in twain for the human bullets that
under his command hurled themselves to their death.
