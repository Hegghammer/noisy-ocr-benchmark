PREFACE
from Smith, who himself was prone to include
the most extraragunt myths in his pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE LIVES AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAMOUS
HIGIWAYMEN. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the "truth" of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less suid the better.
No one hus ever reprinted those wuthors in
their original extravagance, or their grossness.
It would be impossible; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has one ever edited
them, or even written (In independent listory of
the highwaymen. IVhen we consider how astamish-
ingly popular those romances have ey
which have had Clurde Du Vall,
und their like for heroes, this is
surprising.
Perhups the tusk has been
of the difficulty-the alnos
-of sifting fact from
chilling sense that it woit
to present the highwayman as
fellow rarely heroic, generagly foul
a and
cruel, and often cowardl No novelist would
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dis-
service; und I do not think the historiun who cume
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
