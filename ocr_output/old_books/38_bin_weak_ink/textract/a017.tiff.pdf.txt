of blackened ruins, the stark walls of the churele and louses rising up out of the ashes and
charred timbers heaped ou every side. What must it mean to the five thousand men and
women and little children who have survived a painful flight to the sencoast and have now
returned to their mountain home, only to find their houses sacked and burned ! There were
nine Christian villages which clustered about Kessab in the valleys below. Several of these
have been completely destroyed by tire. All have been plundered and the helpless people
driven out or slain.'
Can you imagine the feelings of the Kessab people as they climbed on foot the long trail
up the mountain, and then as they came over the ridge into full view of their charred and
ruined dwellings ? Their stores of wheat, barley and rice had been burned ; clothing, cooking
utensils, furniture and tools had gone; their goats, cows and mules had been stolen ; their silk
industries stamped out their beloved churches reduced to smouldering heaps. The bodies
of
their friends and relatives who had been killed had not been buried. And yet the love
of
home is so strong that the people have settled down there with the determination to elear up
the debris and rebaild their houses." -Extracts from The Sack of Kessab,' Stephen Van R.

As these sheets are goin
rough the press there comes news of famine
at
Zeitoon. The Rev. F. W
American Missionary at Marash,
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet,
Issionary at Constantinople, that
12,000 souls in and around Zeito
5 of hunger they are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran and W.
ooking and eating it, if they can
get even that. Rev. Macullum ad
same story comes to us from all
sides. As we foresaw all ale
on the distress will be greatest.'`
If 50,000 were ma
 ose who have died and are dying
of homelessness and sta
ed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerato
the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.
The latest news is that Mush,
berous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolation of the massaci
as been plundered in a night attack
by armed Kurds, and the villagers are nov educed to extreme distress. Before
the outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeatedly appealed
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec-
tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It is
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
