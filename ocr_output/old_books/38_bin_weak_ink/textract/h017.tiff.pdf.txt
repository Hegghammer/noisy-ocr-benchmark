We give BARNABAS HORTON as the Profacc and Introduction to this
little volume of Chronicles. He was probably the son of Joseph
Horton, of Leicestershire, England, and born in the little hamlet of
Mousely of that shire. Of his history before he came to A
erica very
little is known. He came over in the ship "Swallow,'
633-38.
He landed at Hampton, Mass. How long he remained
unpton
is not known. But in 1640 we find him with his wife
chil-
dren in New Haven, Conn., in company with the Rev.

William Welles, Esq., Peter Hallock, John Tuthill, I

On nearing
the shore they cast lots to decide who should first se bot

land.
The lot fell on Peter Hallock, and the place when the stepped upon
the land has ever since been known as Hallock's anding.
On coming ashore, they all knelt down and engaged in prayer,
Peter Hallock leading, as had been determin
by

These
were the first persons of any civilized nation nat had ever attempted
to settle on the east end of Long Island. Stc Griffin's Journal.
Barnabas Horton was a man of deep-tong! piety, and a warin advo-
cate of civil and religious freedom. He was one of the most promi-
nent and influential men of Southold. He was for many years a
magistrate, and several times a member of the General Court at New
Haven and Harford. He built the first framed dwelling-house ever
erected on the cast of Long Island, and that house is still (1875)
standing and occupied. It is a shingle-house, that is, shingles are
used for weather-boards, and the sides have never been reshingled,
and the roof but once, according to the statement of Jonathan Gold-
smith Horton, the last Horton occupant of the old house.
