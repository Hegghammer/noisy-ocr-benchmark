No one doubts that a great forward movement is reaching its culminat-
ing point in the destiny of Asia. The West has learnt its all of religion (the
moral and guiding principle of mankind) from the East, and now the East
would fain learn the law of restraint and the law of freedom (the protecting
principles of mankind) from the West. Inspired by this feeling the liberal
Turks decidedly mean well, and they are animated with a sincere desire to
ensure peace and security of life and property for the heterogeneons peoples
under the Turkish sway, but they themselves have had to COM and and still
have to contend with a fanatical populace.
To the Mahommedan world at large the Caliph
is the envoy of
God, the sacredness of whose person must be in
Ibdul Hamid, the
astute politician, knew that the security of
fty depended on his
Caliphal rights, and his main poliay durin
criod of his execrable
reign had been directed toward
sserting the same; thus
we can see how his dethronement
Turks would gladly have
accomplished simultaneously
on of the Constitution, had
to be deferred to a later
was necessary for the She k ul
Islam to pronounce
tl
is sacred trust, a violator of the
holy law of the
thronement could be dared or
accomplished.
The Christian Armenians it arkey live in the midst of the followers
of a hostile religion, with no pourer or force behind them which makes for
protection. Who does not know that the great numerical preponderance of
Hinduism keeps the balance of power in India, and restrains bloody religious
hostilities; and when we review the whole religious history of Christian
Europe, and that terribly long roll of crimes committed in the name of 11im
who expounded 11is religion with the parable of the Good Samaritan, and
the precept of loving one's neighbour as one's self, we cannot feel surprise at
the fanatical outbursts of the followers of Mahommed, the founder of a
religion whose doctrines certainly fall short of the humane principles
inculcated by the Founder of Christianity. If authentic historical facts prove
to us that horrible and atrocious cruelties have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other religionists, but on fellow Christians of different
denominations, how then can we expect better things from the Turk unless
some power or force restrain him ?
Christianity has now partly emancipated herself from the ferocities
which darkened and poured the red stream of blcod on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at large, religiou is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite.
