Thus,
near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest men-Mgrditch
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people-slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or" The Ouly-Begotten
is Descended.' From the window of a neighboring loom he might have looked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the viues were now all ("ll close and huried
for
the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling suow and hurricane that hid the
conc of Ararat. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On
the
shore of that lake, eighty-seven years ago, Klirimian was born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land the Sultan still counted as one of the
formid-
able
l'owers
of Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established f England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom-a
reputation which still rath
athetically survives throughout the Near East. Long and
stormy had been the life
ich the Katholikos now looked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to last it had bee
a by one absorbing and unselfish aim-the freedom and
regeneration of his people.

From his carliest years,

homes of Armenians round Art

spirit as only kindles in oppress

which he generously threw open to

years, while Europe was occupied

than even the European could stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent
to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself
summoned to plead his people's cause before thic Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks 110 language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Europe

had
done with success for the Lebanon. In London he became acquainted with Gladstone but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and,
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey's definite reforms. It is necdless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to Londou amid shouts of " Peace with Honor,"
and Armenia was left to stew.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armeniaus were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake
