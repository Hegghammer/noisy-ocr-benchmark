THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
I mean those in the staterooms. I cannot
speak with certainty in regard to the port-
holes on deck E. I believe that the first list
the ship took brought her down to these
open ports on the starboard side and that
she sank much more quickly from filling
through them.
On my return to the deck I felt that the
steamer must make her final plunge any mo-
ment now, and as the vas nothing more that
could be done on the po
for there was
no discipline or order wit
to do it-I
passed through to the star
Men
were striving to lower the
putting women and children in
seemed to me that it only adde
the whole situati
i to a
boat that you knew never would UC cleared
and which would go down with the steamer;
better leave them on the deck to let them
take their chance at a piece of wreckage.
