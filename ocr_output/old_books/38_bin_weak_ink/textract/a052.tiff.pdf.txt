" A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping ; Rahel
weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because
they were not.'
In the twentieth century of the christian era, in the
trumpeted

beginning from the last quarter of the nineteenth and on into the first decade
