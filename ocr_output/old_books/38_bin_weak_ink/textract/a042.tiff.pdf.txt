last great speech of bis heroie life. England attempted some kind of protest. But rather
than join the Liberal demand for action, Lord Rosebery left his party for .private leisure, and
Russia, France, and Germany combined to secure immunity for the "great assassin." It
was the lowest point of Europe's shame.
Blow followed blow. Hardly had the remmant of the Armenian people escaped from
massaere when their Church fell under the brotal domination of Russia. Plehve ordained
its
destruction, and Golitzin was sent to Tiflis as governor-general to carry it out. Church
property to the value of C6,000,000 was seized by violence, the Katholikos resolutely refusing
to
give

Some of the bishops and monks, who form a comucil rott. their ehief, still look for
Europe's interference, and trust that the solemn pledges Nken by Eugland and other Powers
at Berliu may be fultilled. The Bishop of Erivan, for instance, still labors for the appoint-
ment of a Christian governor over the district marked by the ill-omened names of Van, Bitlis,
and Erzeroum. I also found that even among the Georgians there was a large party willing
to concede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian villages are
thickest,
as
an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Caneasus wins federal
autonomy. But the majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and industries. One cannot vet say how far their influence
may
be
surpassed in the growing revolutionary parties of The Bell' and "The Flag." Of these,
the Social Democratic Bell" follows the usual impracticable and pedantic creed of St. Marx.
The Flag," or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a great
assembly held in Erivan last August (1906) they adopted a programme of land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected laymen. If the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.
Whatever may be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
