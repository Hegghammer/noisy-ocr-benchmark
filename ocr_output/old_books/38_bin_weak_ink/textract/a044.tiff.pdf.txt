THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
ARMENIAN PEOPLE.
During a deriod extending over thirty years the civilized world has
heard of Turki Massacres of Armenians. Massacres of a nature so

James Bryce, in his supplementary chapter to the
4th edition of his
anscaucasia and Ararat" makes the following
grave comment :-
"Twenty years
pace in the life of a nation. But these
twenty years have bee
sufferings for the Armenian Christians
greater than their and
endure during the eight centuries that
have passed since the fil
quest of Armenia. They have been
years of misery, slaughte

and primitive Armenians will to this day assert in unshaken belief, God made
man in His own image, and the country round the base of Ararat, where the
generations of men once more began to people the earth.
Once the land of Ararat was an independent kingdom until the tide of
victory rolled over it and conquered its independence. Hemmed round by
three Great Empires, Russian, Turkish and Persian, the unfortunate geo-
graphical position of the country became the cause of its people's ruin.
It is of bitter interest to Armenians to know that Ararat is the point
