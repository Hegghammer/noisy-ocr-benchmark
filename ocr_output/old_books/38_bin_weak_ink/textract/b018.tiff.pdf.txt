CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
No. III.
Two COUCHANT LIONS, AFTER RUBENS, taken from his celebrated picture before alluded
hot Daniel incarcerated in the den. The Lions are here supposed to be miraculously
uillity. Here, too, is not much Expression, but an extraordinary grandeur
reatness of an occasion where the Deity himself especially interferes
of the most terrible of his creatures, in calm submission. There
with this submission, which is very impressive, and even
su
ful restoration of the Nature that was wanting in the
print
engraved by PICART and others,) after RUBENS. The
origina
ortune never to have seen. The shaggy manes, and the latent
terror th
in the open eyes of the superior Lion-suited to the darkness of
the den, ,
cure of this animal's sense of vision,-are as well thought of, as they are
executed ; and are varied with much address from the closed eyes of the couching Lion beyond,
of which also the character is most happily marked. A powerful and divine spell possesses
them both.
No. IV.
THE TIGER WHICH MARCHES IN OUR PROCESSION, without an object before him to call
forth emotion, possesses a calm character, combined with the resistless strength of that dreadful
quadruped ; whose very tranquillity, in his leisure sauntering, when no excitement is acting on his
nerves, has an appalling effect. - His brow is clouded, though his claws are sheathed. There is a
possibility of a dreadful storm which may not be far distant, and that is enough to stamp the
Tiger's character. None shall dare to arouse his energies, nor to eucounter them when aroused.
No. V.
This GROUP OF PLAYFUL LEOPARDS, AFTER RUBENS, must be supposed to belong to the
jocund train of Bacchus, since they are luxuriating at their ease, among grapes and vine branches.
These Leopards are doubtless intended to have a degree of playful expression-induced perhaps by
the exhilarating juice of the grape : and we should "guess" (as Jonathun says) that this group
was studied from a litter of half-grown kittens. Few, however, except the sailors who were
accustomed to grambol with the Tiger-cub on board the Pitt East-Indiaman, would like to venture
to frolic with them.
