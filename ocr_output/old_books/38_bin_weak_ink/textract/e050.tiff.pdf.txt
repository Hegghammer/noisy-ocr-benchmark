THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.
British Museum bears on it the strange and anomalous figure represented
in the annexed illustration. Opinions vary somewhat as to whether
its origin might not have been Italian, but we see no reason for adopting
this view, and consider it as of decidedly home production. It will be
seen that the shoulder, upper part of the arm, and figure are those of
well-formed female, who wears an anmistakable corset, tightly laced,

the thirteenth century, and probably much prior to that period, a long
and slender waist was considered by our ancestors as a criterion of
elegance in the female form. We ought not, therefore, to wonder if it
