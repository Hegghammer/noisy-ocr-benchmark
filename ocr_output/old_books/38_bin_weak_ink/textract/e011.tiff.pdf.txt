PREFACE.
VII
writing in praise of the moderate use of Corsets take their facts,
experiences, and grounds of argument from the every-day life and
general custom of the present period.
The Crinoline is too closely associated with the Corset and with the
mutable modes affected by ladies, from season to season, to be omitted
from any volume which treats of Fashion. The same facts, indeed, may be
stated of both the Crinoline and the Corset. Both appear to be equally
indispoosable to the woman of the present period. To make them
serve tli purposes of increased cleanliness, comfort, and grace, not anl
without il ry to the health, but with positive and admitted
to the pby.
-these are the problems to be
nose
business it
minister to the ever
mion of
the day.
