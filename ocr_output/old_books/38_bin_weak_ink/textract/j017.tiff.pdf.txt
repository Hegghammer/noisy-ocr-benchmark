CANING; THE SEVEN STEPS

open squares are thus formed over the area being caned. Unless
the cane is soaked it will prove rather difficult to pair the canes.
Step 5. This step is the weaving of one set of diagonals. Start
le strand at any corner hole. Use one hand over and one under
1c frame. As the worker becomes skilful he will find it easier
to give the cane a slight curve and work with both hands on the
upper surface. Use an end of cane
long enough for convenient hand-
ling; then pull the entire strand
thru the length of the frame, pro-
ided the area is not too great.
Care must be taken to avoid twist-
ing the cane. The cane will run
easily, and partially under a cane
at the corners of the squares, if cor-
rectly done. Fig. 6 shows this
clearly, as does the illustration in
