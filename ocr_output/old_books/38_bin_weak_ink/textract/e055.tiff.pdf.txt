wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus describes a company of
ladies. They were, says he, "clothed all alike, in kirtles with rich capes
or mantles, parti-coloured, white, and blue, embroidered all over with
various devices." Their bodies are described as being long and small,
and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though each of them
had been a queen. We find that the tight-laced young ladies of the
court of the Lady Triamore "had mantles of green-coloured velvet,
handsomely bordered with gold, and lined with rich furs. Their heads
were neatly attired in kerchiefs, and were ornamented with cut work and
richly-striped wires of gold, and upon their kerchiefs they had each of

There is another poem, said
pore ancient than even Launfal,
which, no doubt, served to give à
ind direction (to the fashicns of
times following after. Here we find beautiful lady described as
wearing a splendid girdle of beaten gold, en-bellished with rubies and
emeralds, about her middle small.
Gower, too, when describing a lover who is in the act of admiring
his mistress, thus writes
"He seeth hir shape forthwith, all
Hir bodye round, hir middle small."
