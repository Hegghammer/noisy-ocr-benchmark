THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN.
Since the gathering of the Plemipotentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in ISTS, and the signing of the still more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armebian nation stands without
its parallel in history.
In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture
the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1 e painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful G ernments of Europe,
but in the interests of Humanity there should be at
ed to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin wr
in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).
It was a curious irony of Fate, that alth

terrible stronghold of Kars," universally admit

of the Russian arms in Asiatic Turkey,
by
an Armenian General; that although
tan
service had led to conquest, and Ar

GENERAL FRINCE LOHIS MELIKOFA
Commanded the Russian forces in Asiatic Turkty
during the Russo-Turkish war and captured the im-
pregnable fortress of Kars. Appointed Prime Minister
of Russia by Alexander II. The liberal policy which
characterized the reign of that excellent monarch, and
the Constitution that he was on the eve of granting to
his people were influenced by Melikoft but after the
death of Alexander II he was not allowed to continue in
his grood work of reforming Russia, being overthrown
from office early in the reign of Alexander III.
