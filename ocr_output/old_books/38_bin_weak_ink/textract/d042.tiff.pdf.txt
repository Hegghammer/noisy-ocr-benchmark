THE CHILD OF THE MOAT
They were almost too excited to sleep and Aline, as
her custom was, when she lay awake, amused herself
by building castles in the air. Sometimes she would
imagine herself as a great lady, sought after by all the
noble knights of the land, but holding herself aloof with
reserved dignity until one, by some deed of unusual
distinction, should win her favour. As a rule, however,
this seemed rather a dull part to play, though there was
something naturally queenly in her nature, and she
would t
prefer something more active. She
would tak
ance of Burd Helen, or
Burd Alin

follow her
knight in u
torrent and
t
the romantic
its imaginary a
to her sense of
of new suggestion
self fleeing before
disappearing at the
om.
But at last she fell
d not
wake till it was near
eal.
