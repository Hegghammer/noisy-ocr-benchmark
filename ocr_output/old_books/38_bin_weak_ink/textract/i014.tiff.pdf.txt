THE ZONE
Avert Thy gaze, O God, close tight Thine eyes!
Glance down no longer on the ocean foam,
Lest Thou behold such horrors as can turn
Men's burning hearts to ice, and chill their souls.
Keep Thine heart warm and full of charity
That Thou mayst yet be able to forgive,
And pity feel for those who know not when
To pause in deeds of ruthless sacrifice.
Restrain Thy wrath, and keep Thine han-
check;
Smite not, nor fiercely thrust without the pa
Those who can dare to strew the ocean wast
With fellow creatures, innocent of wrong
Forget the studied purpose to da
The launching of the missil
agh the deep;
Theshattered hull; the
ned and bleeding forms;
The seething swil of wreckage, women, men.
