viii PREFACE
from Smith, who himself was prone to include
* the most extravagant myths in his pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE Jisrory oF
THE Lives AND Acrions OF THE Most Famous
HienwayMeEen. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the “truth” of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.
No one has ever reprinted those authors in
their original extravagance, or their grossness.
It would be impossible ; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
them, or even written an independent history of
the highwaymen. When we consider how asigpish-
ingly popular those romances have
which have had Claude Du Vall, «
and their like for heroes, this i:
surprising.
Perhaps the tusk has bee;
of the difficulty—the alma
—of sifting fact from
chilling sense that it wot
to present the highwayman «a
fellow rarely heroic, generafly foul- and
cruel, and often cowardly. No novelist would
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dis-
service ; and I do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
