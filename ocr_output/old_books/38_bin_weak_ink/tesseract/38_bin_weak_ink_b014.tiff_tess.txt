2 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

the scene of which, by the way, he has not represented as a royal menageric, but as a wild,

rocky cavern—his animals partake of the artificial character of which we cannot bring’ ourselves to
approve. ,

Of this fact, however, we purpose to exhibit proof with our assertion. Improved versions, to
the best abilities of our Artists, of some of these Lions of RupEns and the Assyrian king, will here
be introduced, which the reader, who pleases, may compare with the originals. Our second, third,
and fourth Plates are of the numjgr.

The Lions of Rubens arefMManized. We do not intend to discuss at length whether the
ideality of allegorical painti ired this: we only state the fact: yet the opinions which we
felt at liberty to form on tk we feel at liberty to utter. So much in apology for using the
licence of asserting that t any of the Lions of Rubens rather resemble those of frowning
old gentlemen s wigs; as if Nature’s journeymen had made manes, and not
made the u of flowing and curling hair, which seems rather to solicit
the 1é perfumer, than to have endured the torrid heats of the desert, or the rough
storms of the forest. The shag of a Lion’s mane is a very different sort of thing.

However such dressed Lions may be thought to accord with Allegory, they are demonstrably
at variance with Nature. ‘To be sure, what might become a Lion in the procession of the Cardinal
Virtues, might be rather unsuitable in Iris den, or within the precincts of those wild haunts, where he
is accustomed to roam in his natural state. We have often read of the fabled Men-bulls, or (Mino-
taurs,) and we find suck on the coinage of Crete. These allegorical creatures of RuneNs, which,
alas! have sometimes been quoted by Artists without half his genius, and placed in savage con-
flicts, or beside their Britannias—are a species of Men-lions. Placed among the Sabeean sculp-
tures, they might pass for incarnations of Sol in Leo; but would very ill pass for Leo alone.

Among the observers of this poetic improvement, or this natural and unpoetical deficieucy, on
the part of Runens, Trrian, Jutio Romano, and other painters, both ancient and modern; and
of the consequent desideratum on the part of the public, of a cabinet or library collection of the
nobler wild animals in a state of Nature, so as to auswer the purposes of reference, while they con-
duced to the pleasures of Taste, were Mr. Encar Spruspury and Mr. Tuomas LANDSEER.
Whetler or not the public “looked up to them for light” on that subject, (to use the language of
STERNE,) they thought the Public “deserved it;” and they therefore, as the best practical means
of eliciting that light, first copied the general forms and attitudes of most of the wild animals that
appear in this book, from the old masters—geuerally speaking, from works that are well known
—and then, went to Nature and corrected the details. They carried with them what, in those
ancient masters, was meritorious in composition, attitude and chiaroscuro, and brought away,
to the best of their ability—superadding it to, and blending it with, the above—accuracy of
detail.
