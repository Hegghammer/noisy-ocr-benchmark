THE LUSITANIA’S LAST VOYAGE

it was not acute, and so I had no difficulty in
making my way to and from my cabin. I
tied on a life belt, took the others in the room
and my small leather case containing my
business papers, and went up on deck to the
port side. I went back to the spot where I
had left the Hubbards, but they had gone,
and I never saw them again.

I found those who needed the life belts,
put them on, tied them properly, and then
went aft along the port side of the ship,
for I was confident that all hagds would
naturally rush to the starboar and so
there would be more opp to help
along the port side. I walked
for’ard toward the bri in Tur-
ner and Captain A calling
in stentorian t ot to lo ay the
boats, ordering all passengers a ilors to
get out of them, saying that there no dan-
ger and that the ship would float. woman
