Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have beg@\exempt ; this super-added evil, is, the
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds Circassians, greater marauders and
depredators than the Turks, the ccupation of whose lives comprises
murder and robbery, and who h; lh weary centuries unremittin,ly
quartered themselves upon the | iristian peasants, and lived on
the fruits of their labour and to he Hamidieh cavalry which
was established expressly for assacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be 1 what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in org find for those habits in
which they were encour dulge by the Hamidiaa
régime.

Under all such condi r days can be forthcoming,
no prospect of better tin r that unhappy portion of the
Armenian race whom ices keeps on the soil of the
fatherland.

Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,

countries guarantees to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil.
