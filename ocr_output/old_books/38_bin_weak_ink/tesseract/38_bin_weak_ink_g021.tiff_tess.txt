COLONIAL FLORIDA. 15
required succors to sail to Puerta d’ Anchusi,
where he intended to go himself, and there to
await Maldonado’s return before he ventured
into the interior; a prudent resolve, suggested
possibly by the sight of the bones of Narvaez’s
horses, which had been slain to furnish cordage
and water-vesscels for his fleet.

But the resolve was as brief as itwaswise. A
few days after Maldonado’s departure a cap-
tured Indian so beguiled Soto with tales of gold
to be found far to the northeast of Apalachee,
where he then was, that banishing all thoughts

of Pu d’ Anchusi from his mind, he began
that cire march which carried him into
South Caroli ern Georgia,and Alabama,
where he wan rch of treasure until
disappointment, w , and needed sup-
plies again turned his southward, and his
thoughts to his rendez with Maldonado.

That rendezvous in October, 1540.
