THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
arms from around my neck, and my brothers
kissed me farewell. Then the man from the
strange boat opened the door of our wattled house
and went out, and I followed him.

We did not go back to the place where he had
left his boat of brass. We went to another place
where there was a harbor with ships. There we
found a ship ready to sail for Urth.

My master sent me on board to ask the cap-
tain if he would take us on a voyage beyond Urth.
The captain said that if my master would guide
them past the Magnetberg he would give him the
ship to sail where he would after the caggo had been
landed. My master said he would is, and we
went on board the ship. It was ev w, and
a breeze came up, and the shi away,
bringing me from the place where n and
reared and toward the strange c were
beyond the rim of the sea. he
sailors what was the Magnetberg, and e
that it was a mountain of loadstone that drew th
iron out of ships that came near it and left them
loosened timbers upon the water.
