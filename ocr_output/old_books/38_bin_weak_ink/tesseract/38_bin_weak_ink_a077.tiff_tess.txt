I will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and relate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
1796 after ruling over Armenia fifty-eight years.

He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his dominions, and
grew to be so mighty in battle that the neighbouring nations called his
