: OE
THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE. 29
Oriental figure of speech, is said to have been ‘ravished by the beauty |
of her sandals.’ Like the belles of Egypt she did not disdain, in setting |
off her charms, to have recourse to perfumes and cosmetics, and
previously to setting out she ‘anointed herself with precious ointment. |
In another place Jezebel is said to ‘paint her eyelids ;’ and Solomon, in
the Proverbs, in describing the deceitful woman, adjur@@Mhis son not to
be ‘taken with her eyelids,’ evidently alluding to the of collyrium. — |
The Jewish beauty owed no slight obligation to her Jant tresses, |
which were decorated with waving plumes and stri earls ; and
in allusion to this custom, followed among the tribe be imme- |
morial, St. Paul aflirms that ‘a woman’s ornament j Judith
‘braided the hair of her head and put a tire upon 1 dress
of Pharaol’s daughter, in the Canticles, is comy to |
Carmel. No mention is made of Judith’s mirror, dly —!
made of brass, like those described in Exod be
looking-glasses of the women which asse
tabernacle of the congregation.’”
