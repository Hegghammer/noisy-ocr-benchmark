The efforts of the Armenians, and the entreaties of their Patriarch
Nerses had procured the insertion of Article 16 in the Treaty of San
Stefano signed between Russia and Vurkey in March 1878. In fact the
wording of the Article had been suggested by the Patriarch himself. It
provided the following stipulation for the protection of the Armenians :-—

‘“‘ As the evacuation by the Russian troops of the territory which they
now occupy in Armenia, and which is to be restored to Turkey, might give
rise to conflicts and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good
relations between the two countries, the Sublime Porte engages to carry into
effect without further delay the improvements and reforms demanded by
local requirements in the provinces inhabited by the Armentans, and to
guarantee their security against the Kurds and Circassians.”

What followed has passed into history. The British Government of
which Lord Beaconsfield (then Mr. D’Israeli) was Premier, and J.ord Salis-
bury Foreign Secretary, once more pursued the old policy of baffling Russian
agerandizement in Turk deep tterests
would thereby become 1 ler power,
and virtually conman n in lieu of
the Treaty of San St fa natural and
immediate protector protection which
the Armenians the the security of im-
potent words giv _

“The Sublj e undert rithout further delay the
improvements orms dem quirements in the provinces
inhabited by rmenians, a e their security against the
Circassians Kurds. It will make known the steps taken to
this effect t# the Powers, who v end their application.”

“Tt will pertodically ma it the steps taken to this effect to the
Powers, who will superintend application.” How this last proviso
could furnish food for laughter e it not for the terrible tragedy involved
in it.

The insertion of Article 61 in the Treaty of Berlin, granted, or rather
seemingly granted, by the six Powers of Europe, proved in reality, as sub-
sequent events bore out, an instrument of death and torture. It was as if
the reversal of the figures had reversed the possibilities of succour and
protection, and with the death of the Czar Liberator, the last chance of the
Armenians died.

The Turkish Massacres of 1875 and 1876 which led up to the Russo-
Turkish War of 1877 are historical facts too well known to need further
