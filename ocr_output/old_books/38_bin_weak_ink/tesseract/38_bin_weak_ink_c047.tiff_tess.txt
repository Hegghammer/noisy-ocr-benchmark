THE STORY OF EEAN THE FISHERMAN’S SON

“Your third dream,” said the ancient dwarf,
“was the Dream of the Arrows.”

“Tt is even so,” said the King. “I dreamed
of arrows that were shot upward to a great height.”

And then the King was silent, and he and the
dwarf looked long upon Zabulun the Enchanter.
But Zabukyn took a step nearer to them, and he
said :

“Tn the lore oMthe Chaldeans, arrows shot up-
ward signify a veryWgigh tower. I can tell you
now the significance of three dreams, O King.
They are of a treasure tha¥g to come into your
possession. The treasure is hi . It is hidden
beneath a tower. The height to the arrows
were shot shows that the treasure is under
the highest of towers — under the Tower o -
lon.”

At the mention of the Tower of Babylon, O
King of the Western Island, a great fear came over
me, for I knew that it was now that Zabulun’s
plan for the taking of the Magic Mirror was being
put into practice. And it seemed to me that fear
came over the ancient dwarf too, for he fell

43 .
