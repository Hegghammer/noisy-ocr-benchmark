THE ZONE
Avert Thy gaze, O God, close tight Thine eyes!
Glance down no longer on the ocean foam,
Lest Thou behold such horrors as can turn
Menâ€™s burning hearts to ice, and chill their souls.
Keep Thine heart warm and full of charity
That Thou mayst yet be able to forgive,
And pity feel for those who know not when
To pause in deeds of ruthless sacrifice.
Restrain Thy wrath, and keep Thine han
check;
Smite not, nor fiercely thrust without the
Those who can dare to strew the ocean was
With fellow creatures, innocent of wron
Forget the studied purpose to
The launching of the miss) gh the deep;
Theshattered hull; t ed and bleeding forms;
The seething sy wreckage, women, men.
