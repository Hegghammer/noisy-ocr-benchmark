like a round bow, 2 great brown cye revealed the inward spirits intelligence and zeal an-
quenched. On his head was a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.

Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century’s greatest men—Merditch
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people—slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Ltchmiatzin, or The Ouly-Begotten
is Descended.”” From the window of a neighboring room he might have looked across the
frost hound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were vow all cut close and huried for the
winter, Beyond the plain stood a dark inass of whirling snow and hurricane chat hid the
cone of Ararat. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of that Inke, eighty-seven yeurs ago, Khrimian was born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land; the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able Powers of Europe. [t was four years before Byron <ct out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established éngland a reputation as the generous champion of freedom—a
reputation which still rath athetically survives throughout the Near Kast. Long and
stormy had been the life ay ich the Katholikos now looked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to Iast it had bee sd by one absorbing and unselfish aim—the freedom and
regencration of his people. | had failed.

From his earliest years, ¥ vitnessed the terrors of Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round Ar ossessed by the spirit of uationality—such a
spirit as only kindles in oppres3 e away into easygoing tolerance amone the

and recalling to his people by nd glories of their national history.

which he generously threw open t <sins of Armenians. For many
years, while Europe was oceupicd 4 wars, or French and German
wars, we see him ceaselessly jou tinople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the his schools burned, his

his office after four ye:

But the cup gi y was filling. 1 pitiless slaughter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alik iar even the European PowWers could stand. With varied motives,
liussia sent Arimics to fight their way to the walls of(Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to plead his people’s cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the yvreat courts of Murope
heforchand, urging them ta create an autonomous neutral state for Armenia, as they had
done with success for the Lebanon. Tn London be became acquainted with Gladstone ; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and,
in the Congress itsel{ Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkcy’s definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed.  Beaconstield returned to Londou amid shouts of “ Peace with Honor,”
and Armenia was left to stew.

So it went on. Detained in Constantinople ax prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Kutholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake:
