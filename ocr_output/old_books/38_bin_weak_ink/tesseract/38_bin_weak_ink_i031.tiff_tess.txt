THE LUSITANIA’S LAST VOYAGE

I mean those in the staterooms. I cannot
speak with certainty in regard to the port-
holes on deck E. I believe that the first list
the ship took brought her down to these
open ports on the starboard side and that
she sank much more quickly from filling
through them.

On my return to the deck I felt that the
steamer must make her final plunge any mo-
ment now, and as th as nothing morethat -
could be done on the p —for there was
no discipline or order wi do it—I
passed through to the sta fen
were striving to lower the
putting women and children in
seemed to me that it only
the whole situass oa
boat that you knew never wo cleared
and which would go down with the steamer;
better leave them on the deck to let them
take their chance at a piece of wreckage.
