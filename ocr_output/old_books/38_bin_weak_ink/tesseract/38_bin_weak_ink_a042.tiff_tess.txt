Some of the bishops and monks, who form a coMgeil roWM&their chief, still look for
Europe’s interference, and trust that the solemn pledges Nken by England and other Powers
at Berlin may be fulfilled. ‘The Bishop of Evivan, for instance, still labors for the appoint-
ment of a Christian governor over the district marked by the ill-omened uaimes of Van, Bitlis,
and Erzeroum. 7 also found that even among the Georgians there was a large party willing
to concede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian villages are thickest,
us an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Cancasus wins federal
autonomy, But the majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto haye led the people, are
heginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and industries. One cannot vet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolutionary parties of ‘The Bell” and ‘The Flag.” Of these,
the Social Democratic “ Bell ” follows the usual impracticable and pedantic creed of St. Mary.
The “Flag,” or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a great

universal suttrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the contro] of the Church property

with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the couutry are set.

Whatever may be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, T think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could he
