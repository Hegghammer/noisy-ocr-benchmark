meaning ; sometimes modes of expression are so difficult to translate from
one language into another, and it can be said that the term “Illuminator” is
used for want of a better word in English. The Armenians call their
religion “loois havat’’ the word “loois’” means “light” and “havat”’
means “faith” or “religion,” but if I translated the two words as
“enlightened faith” or “enlightened religion” the translation would not
suitably convey the meaning of the original.

THE CATHEDRAL OF MIATZIN.
(Only Begotten Des: ed). -
Seat of the Supreme Patriarch. The foundation st@he was laid hy St. Gregory the
Ttuminator who built the Church in the third century of the Christian era.

The cathedral of Etchmiatzin is identified with Gregory; its name
‘“Etchmiatzin”’ means in the Armenian language ‘the only begotten is
descended,” and the story attached to it is, that ina vision Christ appeared
to Gregory descended in light; Gregory built his church on the spot where
the vision had appeared to him, giving it the name of “ Etchmiatzin”’ (only
begotten descended). The cathedral also gives its name to the town
Etchmiatzin, the ecclesiastical metropolis of Armenia.
