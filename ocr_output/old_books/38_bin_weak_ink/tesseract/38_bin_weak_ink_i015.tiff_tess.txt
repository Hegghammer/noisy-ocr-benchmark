Remember that they know not what they do
Who strike in deadly fear and ghastly hate;
Remember that somehow, and at some time,
Each crime exacts its human penalty.
Remember that man’s conscience and man’s mind
Are agents of Thy purpose and Thy plan,
Which work within a deadlier revenge
Than any shrapnel shot or sabre thrust.
Remember new generations come
Upon whom fa d the curse,
The anguish of ol
The crushing debt, the
Restrain, O God, the sweep of
Recall the nations to their sense o
To those in blinding war, to us at peaces
Reveal anew the message of the Christ.
