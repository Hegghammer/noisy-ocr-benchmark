REED AND SPLINT WEAVING

Reeds which are used extensively for basket-making and weaving
in general are procured from the species of palm described in Chap-

applied to several distinct species of large water loving grasses.
Such reeds are usually designated under the name of grasses. There
are a thousand species of palm distributed over the tropical regions
of the entire world, but only a few are native in the United States,
and these are of no distinct commercial value. The rattan or cane
palms of India and the Malay Islands grow to an unusual height,
and are imported into this country in gregmMguantities. These rat-
