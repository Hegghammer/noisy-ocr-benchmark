Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
Turkish rule? To this question, we must answer an emphatic No!

‘The causes that must operate against any change are many and deep-
seated. Jn the first place it cannot be expected that a few Turks of liberal
ideas (or it may be French polished) at Constantinople, are going to change
the thought and character of the nation. The characteristics of a people
change very slowly, if they ever change at all, and the predominant national
traits of the many-blooded modern Turk have been shown to the world to
be, cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a fierce sensuality ; and what is
more than all, and which has to be remembered most, is, that they are a
people accustomed to the unbridled gratification of their worst passions.

‘The ethnographic traits of the Turkman which history bears out, are
wildness and fierceness, and it would not be incorrect to argue that with the
instincts of his primitive ancestors have been assimilated the 1 ? cross
currents that run in his veins, into all of which has ised the
doctrines of the religion of the sword, a religion whe make for
the peace or well being of mankind; a religg ning one of
the two sexes to the degraded position for the gross
pleasure of the other, does not mak kind.

To quote again the eng erred to: ‘'No
Mahommedan race or dy to govern well
even subjects of its rights to subjects of
a different creedg @.”

Not the Je elect and chosen, and
originating the ni . Not the Christian conceit
emanating from th P the flattering unction to its
soul of superiority d its own time. Not the unbending
caste cxclusiveness o ss whose path even the shadow of
the despised Sudra fa deemed defilement. Not any of these,
can equal the intolerant pride of the Mahommedan, or reach the
pmnacle of religious self’ tency on which he has seated himself. To be
a Mahommedan, is enough—Cela suffit.

To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans, and
intimate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahommedan is above all things a Mahommedan. His
religion is the paramount question in his life, and remains its predominating
feature above everything else. ‘This should not be surprising, since to the
‘faithful’ Paradise is secured, and all crimes and transgressions against.
“unbelievers” absolved.
