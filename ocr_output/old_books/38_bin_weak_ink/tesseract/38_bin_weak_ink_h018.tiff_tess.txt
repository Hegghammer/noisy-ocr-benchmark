VI Preface.—fntroduction.

It is said that Barnabas Horton I. was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities.

His tombstone is of ltnglish blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It is elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. ‘The original base was of brick, but it had all crumbled down
many years ago. The present base was put under the stone at the
time iN vas re-lettered by Jonathan G. Horton.

The igription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads as
follows ;

“Were lieth bu the body of Mr. BARNABAS Horrox, who was born at
Mousely, Leicestersh QQ 1d England, and died at Southold, on the 13th day of
July, 1680, aged So year’

In the centre of the st ce find the Mpitaph, as follows:

.

“Here lies my abed in dust

*Til Christ shall raise it with the just;

My soul ascended t pne of God,

Where with sweet Jes nake abode :

Then hasten after me, mJ wife,

To be partaker of this bless

And you, dear children, all fo he TD

Hear and obey His public sacred’ word ;

And in your houses call upon [fis name,

For oft E have advised you to the same:

Then God will bless you with your children all,

And to this blessed place [le will you call.”

Heb. xi: 4.— He being dead, yet speaketh.”

It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted,-was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the original
thirteen who brought his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and memory
should not perish from the earth.
