Jonathan and Jos Jr., David and Caleb
Horton,

The reader will see ata gla plan of this book. We com-
mence with the Christian name. n follows the parentage, genea-
logical data, &c., and then the Cl an names of the children and
order of births. In many of thefea§y families the exact order of
births cannot be ascertained; bufit haX\been approximated as nearly
as possible. The lineage is given in connection with the first member
of the family. ‘Yhe Roman numerals indicate the order of births.
The sons and daughters of the old Puritan, Barnahas, constitute the
second generation, but they are spoken by way of eminence as Joseph
J., Hannah I., &c. ‘Phe book contains much repetition, but none
too much to make it plain and casy to study.

‘This little book contains the chronicles of only about one-half of
the Horton families looked up. ‘Those whose genealogical data are
given only in a small part, and those whose correct lineage has not
been satisfactorily ascertained, are not included in this book.
