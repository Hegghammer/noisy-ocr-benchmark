CHAPTER III
HATE AND LOVE

LINE eertainly did not belong to any ordinary
A type and she would have puzzled the psychol-

ogist to classify. She was so many sided as to
be in.a class by herself. She had plenty of common
sense and intelligence for her years and an outlook
essentially fair minded and just. But she also had a
quiet hauteur, curiously coupled with humility, and at
the same time a winning manner that was irresistible;
so that the strange thing was that she had only to ask
and most people voluntarily submitted to her desires.
This unusuakpower might have been very dangerou
to her character wed her, had it not been th
what she wanted wa 1 and rea
able and moreover she n
own benefit. Further, her hu
capacity for judgment caused her b
the power at all. In practice it was a
to those cases where a sweet minded child’s nz
stinct for fair play sees further than the sophistrie
the adult.

She was practically unaware of this power, which
was destined to bring her into conflict with Eleanor
Mowbray ; nor did she take the least delight, as she might
easily have done, in exercising power for power’s sake.
