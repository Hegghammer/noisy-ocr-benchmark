“ God shall enlarge Japhet and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem, and
Canaan shall be his servant.”

For the interpretation of this blessing of Noal’sgto his cldest son, and
of how it may or may not have met with its fuj@Mment, I shall leave to
theologians to discuss, and only record it here as tation from Genesis.
Beyond the story of his connection with the d this blessing with

Tradition has woven a romance round the names of towns and villages
in Armenia. ‘No aighee’ (Noah's vineyard) is the name of a village
