Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have clung to their christian faith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure.

The cathedral of Etchmiatzin built by Gregory still stands to-day ; it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, until perhaps
little of the original building may be left, but ic still claims to be the 1
built by the patron sain Armenia. I shall here quote rom
“Historical Sketch o ian Church,” yg menian
priest :

“Owing to po archate had at
times to be transf Principal towns of
Armenia. In the y; win, in 993 to Ani,
in 1114 to Rémklal Pdon of Cilicia becoming
extinct, and, we ha 10 longer a capital town, it
was natural and to its own original place, as
the entire nation u A.ccordingly, in the year 1441, it

* was decided by an, at the seat of the Catholicus should
return to Holy FE to this day has been preserved the
proper unbroken succession our Apostles and from cur holy Father,
St. Gregory the Illuminator.”

I read the other day in one of the foreign papers published in Japan,
the following piece of news : .

“An Armenian Church pronounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christian era, has been discovered ina fair state of preserva-
tion in the neighbourhood of Bash-Aparnah.”

Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light on Armenian history.
