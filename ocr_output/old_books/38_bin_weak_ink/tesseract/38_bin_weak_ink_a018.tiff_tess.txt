PREEACI TO 2xp PRINTING.

The first and second € book were written and printed
in pamphlet form for circ ne United States, shortly after the
Adana Massacres of April, 1 I have now thought it advisable to add
a Supplement of a short history of the Origin of the Armenians and the
Introduction and Revival of Christianity in Armenia.

. The illustrations and the extracts from the periodicals ‘‘ Harper’s
Monthly,” “The Wide World” and the ‘ Cosmopolitan ”’ have been added
to the 2nd printing.
