THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
came on without sails or oars. It was a shining
boat, a boat of brass. I called to my father and
my father straightened himsclf up and watched it.
In the boat that came toward us of its own accord
there was 4 man standing.

The boat came into the full water between the
rocks, and then it sank down, this boat of brass, un-
til its rim the water. It remained still as
if anchored. s in the prow of the
boat stepped o ween my father
and me.

He looked a man o se a prince
or a potentate. He ha a dark,
curly beard, and he had eyé wks’
eyes. He had on a straig 1e
material covered all over with
and in his hand he held a long
that had the shape of two serpent
gether. He looked at me and I was
him, and I turned to my father. But my fa
was standing there, holding the fishing pole in
his hands, his mouth open, gasping like one of the
fishes upon the rocks.
