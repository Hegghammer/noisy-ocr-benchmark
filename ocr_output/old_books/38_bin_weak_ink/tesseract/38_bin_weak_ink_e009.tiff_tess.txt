PREFACE
+o

THE subject which we have here treated is a sort of figurative
battle-field, where fierce contests have for ages been from time to time
waged; and, notwithstanding the determined assaults of the attacking
hosts, the contention and its cause remain pretty much as they were at the
commencement of the war. We in thg matter remain strictly ngutral,

merely performing the part of the pub]@™® “own correspondeygg# making

it our duty to gather together such ts from despatc th ancient
and modern, as may prove interest important e note of the
vicissitudes of war, mark its v ses, , to do our best
to lay clearly before our rea —experiences and
arguments—relating to the question.”

As most of our reade ding journals especially
intended for the perusal of for many years the media
for the exchange of a vz letters and papers touching
the use of the Corset. ons relating to the history of
this apparently indispensa of ladies’ attire, its construction,
application, and influence o gure have become so numerous of late
that we have thought, by dying all that we can glean and gamer |
relating to Corsets, their Rvearers, and the various costumes worn by
ladies at different periods, arranging the subject-matter in its due order |
as to dates, and at the same time availing ourselves of careful illustration |
when needed, that an interesting volume would result.
