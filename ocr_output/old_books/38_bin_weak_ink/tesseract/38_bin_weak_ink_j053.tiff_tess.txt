the other. Considerable force needs to be exerted in packing, and
caution used to avoid breaking strands.

Rectangular Seats.—As stated, in weaving a square seat the
initial process is repeated at all corners until all openings are filled.
In rectangular seats the spaces on the short rails will fill before

those on the long rails. Weaving around corners is then manifestly
impossible. Fig. 42 shows a partly woven seat with the short rails
filled, and the process of filling up the remaining area under way.
The method is this: Go over and under a long rail, across half the
frame opening and up thru, then across the remaining distance, and
over and under the other long rail. Repeat until the seat is com-
pleted. Fig 43 is a sketch of a partly woven seat, illustrating the
method of filling in the center just descriked. It supplements
photograph and makes the method clearer.

It should be noted that the strands in crossing at the cen
be compressed one-half of their diameters. They will
