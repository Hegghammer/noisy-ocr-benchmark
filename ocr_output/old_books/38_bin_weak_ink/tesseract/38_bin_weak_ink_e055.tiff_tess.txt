THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE. 49 |
having only her kirtle upon her back. John Gower, however, who
wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus describes a company ‘of
ladies. ‘They were, says he, “clothed all alike, in kirtles with rich capes
or mantles, parti-coloured, white, and blue, embroidered all over with
various devices.” Their bodies are described as being long and small,
and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though cach of them
had been a queen. We find that the tight-laced young ladies of the |
court of the Lady Triamore “had mantles of green-coloured velvet, | :
handsomely bordered with gold, and lined with rich furs, Their heads
were neatly attired in kerchiefs, and were ornamented with cut work and ;
richly-striped wires of gold, and upon their kerchiefs they had. each of |
them a.pretty coronal, embellished with sixty gems or more ;” and of
their prett ies said in the same poem, that her cheeks were as
red as the rose s. Her hair shone upon her head
like golden wire, crown of gold richly ornamented with
precious stones. He nd her mantle, lined with white |
ermine, was also elegant ame. The Princess Blanche,
the daughter of Edwar ect of the annexed illustration,
appears to have copied clo ress above described, and, like the
maids of honour of the La iamore herself, she is not only richly
habited but thoroughly wel as well, ‘Thus we see, in the year '
1361, the full influence o t on the costume of that period.
There is another poem, sai ore ancient than even Launfal,
which, no doubt, served to give z nd direction ,to the fashicns of
times following after. Here we fin beautiful lady described as
wearing a splendid girdle of beatén gold, eMbellished with rubies and
emeralds, about her middle small.
Gower, too, when describing a lover who is in the act of admiring
his mistress, thus writes:—
“He seeth hir shape forthwith, all |
Hir bodye round, hir middle small.”
