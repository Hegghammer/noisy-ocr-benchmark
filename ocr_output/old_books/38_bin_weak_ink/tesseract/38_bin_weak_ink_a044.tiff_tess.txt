THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
ARMENIAN PEOPLE.

During a Ngrioc extending over thirty years the civilized world has

heard of Turk WMiassacres of Armenians. Massacres of a nature so
ferocious and diaN@iMal, so hideous and revolting, that no pen could adequate-
ly describe their h

Writing in 184 ames Bryce, in his supplementary chapter to the
4th edition of his Manscaucasia and Ararat” makes the following
grave comment :—

“Twenty years nace in the life of a nation. But these
twenty years have bee sufferings for the Armenian Christians
greater than their and endure during the eight centuries that
have passed since the fil guest of Armenia. They have been

The land of the Euphrates and Tigris, that Araxes valley, where, as simple
and primitive Armenians will to this day assert in unshaken belief, God made
man in His own image, and the country round the base of Ararat, where the
generations of men once more began to people the earth.

Once the land of Ararat was an independent kingdom until the tide of
victory rolled over it and conquered its independence. Hemmed round by
three Great Empires, Russian, Turkish and Persian, the unfortunate geo-
graphical position of the country became the cause of its people’s ruin.

It is of bitter interest to Armenians to know that Ararat is the point
where the three Empires, Russian,.Turkish and Persian, meet, whilst the
