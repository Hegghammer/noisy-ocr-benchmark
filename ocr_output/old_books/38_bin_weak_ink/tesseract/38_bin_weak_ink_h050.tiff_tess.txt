He possesses fine social qualities, and, since retiring from business, he *
occasionally amuses himself in hunting and fishing. His integrity,
industry and great business capacities, during the active part of his
life, rendered him a most valuable acquisition to the community in
which he carried on his business, and the articles he manufactured
were of sterling value to the farming interests of the country.

Mr. Horton, on sending me his photograph for an engraving.
accompanied it with the following very modest and unassuming sketch
of his life :

“Twas born in Yorktown, Westchester County, New York, 15
Septem 1806. My parents were farmers, in moderate circum-
stances. Ined with them until I was seventeen, working on the
farm in the se nd going to school in the winter, thus acquiring
merely a commo ication. When I was seventeen years old,
at the suggestion I decided to learn the blacksmith
trade, and commence t once, and served an appren-
ticeship for several years October, 1827, I married
Phebe Tompkins, and on the we moved to Peeks-
kill village, where we have res! ht some pro-
perty, and set up the blacksmithin ell in the
business. In the spring of 1835 lei Usl-
ness with Mr. Truman Minor, under the
ton,’ and went into the foundry business,
implements, principally ploughs and p
increased rapidly, and paid us y
twenty years. In 1855 Mr.
in Mr. Geo. W. Depeu
we admitted each
Depeu & Song arly every
State in : Tany foreign countries.

“ 2 we all sold out to a stock company, formed for that pur-
pose. Having been in active business for thirty years, I new retired.
In the spring of 1855 I was elected Supervisor of the town of Cort-
landt, and I represented that town in the Board of Supervisors for five
years in succession.

‘(In the winter of 1358, ] was a member of the [.egislature from
this Assembly District. For many years I held the various offices of
our village, but of late have declined official stations, preferring the
enjoyments of private life.’”’

Mr. Horton is not a public professor of Christianity, but is a gen-
tleman of correct moral deportment, and very temperate in his halts.
