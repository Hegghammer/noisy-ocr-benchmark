of blackened rains, the stark walls of the churehes and louses rising up eut of the ashes and
clurred timbers heaped on every side. Whut must it mean to the five thousand men and
women and little children who have survived a painful flight to the seacoast and have now
returned to their mountain home, only to find their houses sacked and burned! ‘There were
nine Christian villages which clustered about Kessab in the valleys below. Several of these
have been completely destroyed by tire. AIL have been plundered amd the helpless people
driven out or slain.”

“Can you imagine the feelings of the Kessab people as they climbed on foot the lung trail
up the mountain, and then as they came over the ridge into full view oftheir charred ani
ruined dwellings? Their stores of wheat, barley and rice had been burned ; clothing, cooking
utensils, furniture and tools had gone; their goats, cows and mules had been stolen; their silk
industries stamped out ; their beloved churches reduced to smouldering heaps. ‘The budies of
their friends and relatives who had been killed had not been buried. And yet the love of
home is so strong that the people have =ettled down there with the determination to clear up
the debris und rebaild their houses.’—Extracts from “ The Sack of Kessab,” Stephen Van R.

If 50,000 were m ose who have died and are dying
of homelessness and s d 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerat he people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings:

The latest news is that Musi¥ erous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolation of the massa s been plundered in a night attack
by armed Kurds, and the villagers are noWeduced to extreme distress. Before
the outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeatedly appealed
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec-
tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It is
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
