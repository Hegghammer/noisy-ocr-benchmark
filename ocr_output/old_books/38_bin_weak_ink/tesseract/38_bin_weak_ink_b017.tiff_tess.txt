CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. 3

Ikvery artist does best, that which he is best qualified and best disposed to do. In com-
pleting the number of plates that has been found necessary for the Work, Mr. Epwin LANDSEER
has chosen to proceed toward the same purpose, upon a different principle. He has gone, without
any introductory medium, directly to the living animals, and has exhibited the savage manners and
habits of these quadrupeds, according to his own ideas and observations.

0 inction between CHARACTER and EXPRESSION, we shall now deliver our opinion.
By the on animal, we mean those permanencies of his look and features which he
always offers in a placid, or unimpassioned state: by his Expression, the variations
of muscular act n character, to which he is liable, as the storms of passion sweep
by, and hig mind b xternal circumstances acting on the ardours of his instinct.

The former, seen in the solid and massy parts: the latter, agitates, oft-
times rebelliously, the n . Character is ever present, both in the animal coun-
tenance, and in the “hum The most violent expression does not proscribe, or
obliterate, character. Individut it, as far as concerns external appearance ; and it
forms the system of vowels of the larly re, without which no Expression could be.

Whoever regards the faces of a flock Ml see in them an infinite variety of Character,
with very little Expression, and that little with sity: and if we descend a step lower in
the scale of being, and contemplate the finny tribe, 2» Character is not wanting, we find no
Expression at all. Even Trees and inanimate objects, pos#@ Character. We recollect a poetical
friend of ours, now in Italy, saying that every tree and every Meck had a faee—but of this we are
not so certain ; though very certain, that there is enough of Character in rocks and trees, to make
a poet think so.

Character and Expression, in the carnivorous class of animals, to which we here solicit
attention, are always co-existent — their proportions varying with the existing occasions—in
pictorial exhibitions of such subjects.

TnenE is much Character, and little Expression, in the reposing Leopard with his sheathed
claws, which is shewn in the present engraving, copied by Mr. Spitspury from RipIncex, and
corrected from Nature. RiprinGER was an artist of great power, who studied wild animals in
their sequestered haunts, as is shewn in his grand forest back-grounds ; and who, generally
speaking, left little or no room for others to improve, except on some few of his inferiér works.
The present is an interesting and beautiful animal, yet there is a latent capability of mischief
characterised in his countenance, and we might ask, in the language of Job, “ Who shall dare to
rouse him up ?”
