than over a half a century; and lastly Jonathan G. Horton, about a
half a century; making in all two hundred and thirteen years at the
death of Jonathan G, Horton, 3 July, 1873. These six generations
all living and dying in the old mansion! Could those old walls re-
echo all the words ever spoken there, and exhibit anew all the scenes
ever witnessed there—the book containing such a record would vastly
exceed in volume the size of the old castle. Tt would bring to light
much that is now in darkness, and must forever remain hidden from
the generations of the living.

At the death of Jonathan G. Horton, the old homestead became,
by will, the property of the Rev. Mrs. Williams, of Brooklyn, N. Y.,
who was the adopted daughter of Jonathan G. Horton, he nger
having had issue, so that on the 3d of July, 1873, the old homesfad
went out of the Horton name.

Mrs. Williams proposes to sell it, and if some of the Hort 0
not buy it, it will indicate a lack of decent respect for the olc e,
if not for the Horton name. It should be bought back he
Horton name, suitably repaired and preserved for the w, nd
admiration of generations of Hortons yet unborn. G.
Horton, the short, thick man, and Stuart T. Terry, ; en
