orgy, except to call them fiends incarnate; and who is the bold man who
can guarantee that these same fiends incarnate have become metamorphosed
and changed all of a sudden; or that the handful of liberal Turks at Con-
stantinople are capable of controlling and restraining them. We have not
even heard that the leaders and participators of the last massacres have
been punished as they deserved ; and what is the reason they are left un-
punished ? because the Government is afrgid to punish Mahomunedans for
killing Christians; because the liberal Tiirks dare not punish the “ true
believers ”’ for killing “ Kaffirs.”

The religion of Mahommed, the relig@} of the sword, has been infused
into the Turk, and to understand the effq@™ of the religion of Mahommed
upon the ; it is necessary to regard from four aspects, or from four
points of ana First, the fundamenta trine and law of the religion.
Second, the char’ f the founder as a niple to his followers. Third,
the racial and ethnoX be characteristi the Turk. Fourth, the effect

In conclusion, I will ask my readers to one point of difference
between the two races, the oppressor and the ed. Thousands upon
thousands of Armenian women, thousands upo isands of Armenian
children, have been hounded to death, or savagely, bously, horribly and
loathsomely maltreated by the Turk, and yet in all the aWgizing years when
Massacre has succeeded upon Massacre, has there becn of&{known case or
one single instance of a Turkish weman or child maltreated b} Armenians ?

The last massacres though especially organized from the Palace at
Constantinople, were officially announced to originate from an affray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed one of the three :
given equal numbers and arms, the Armenian is always a match for the
Turk, but alas for him that unequal numbers and want of arms have always
made him the victim of his oppressor.

Ahmed Riza Bey in the first part (Ses Causes) of his book ‘ La Crise de
L’Orient”’ published in Paris in 1907 holds a brief for his nation which
through its own fallacious arguments falls to the ground. Iwill quote one
passage as an example.
