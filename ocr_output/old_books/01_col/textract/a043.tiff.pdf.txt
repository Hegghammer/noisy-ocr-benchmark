Ararat, with nearly equal height. They have been rent asunder and tormented by Persians,
Turks, Tartars, and Russians in turn. Even their religion is not nationalistic or distinetly
separate from other forms of religion, like the Jewish. Except for metaphysical shades
of
difference, hardly comprehensible to the modern world, there is little to distinguish it from the
orthodox Christianity of the Near East. Yet, through innumerable disasters and attempts
at extermination, the l'ace persists, like the Jews, with astonishing vitality, unmistakable in
characteristics which may not be exactly heroic, but lead to a certain material success. After
all, it is only in harassed and persecuted nationalities that true patriotism ever survives.
