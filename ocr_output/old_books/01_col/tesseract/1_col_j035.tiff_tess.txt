RESEATING A CHAIR; HAND CANING 31
otherwise the final weaving will prove difficult. The finished seat,
when dry, should ring when struck sharply with the fingers.

The method of tying cane, preventing twists, etc., has been ex-
plained. Reference should be made to these points, when anything
is not fully understood in this discussion of chair seating. .

in the last two, and also that more than one diagonal of a given
series enters the same hole. In every case it will enter that hole
which leaves its course in as straight a line as possible. In rect-
angular areas it is never necessary to run two diagonals into the
same hole, except at the corners. This applies to two diagonals of
the same series.

Refinishing.—The refinishing of a chair is a distinct problem,
and one which the cane weaver should understand. He should

as a chair which needs a new seat invariably is in need of refinish-
