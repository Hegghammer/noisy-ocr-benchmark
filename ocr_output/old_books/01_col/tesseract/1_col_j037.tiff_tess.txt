the frame needs protection from it. Pieces of bristol or card board
may be placed under the needle on either side of the frame. The
needle is bound to mar the surface of the frame if this precaution

has been removed; this to avoid any possibility of marring the seat
frame later. However, it is better practice to refinish the chair
first, and cane the seat last. .
