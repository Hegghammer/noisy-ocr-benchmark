When this book was written, the writer was It
under the supposition then generally current that 1
the Armenian Massacres of April, 1g09, in Cilicia / it
were instigated by Abd-ul Hamid and his Yildiz i]
Clique. Babikian Effendi, the Armenian deputy |
who went to Adana from Constantinople to in- :
vestigate into the massacres, plainly reported that , {
all investigations had failed to trace them to Abd-ul :
Hamid and his Yildiz Clique. Babikian Effendi, 1
as was to be expected, died suddenly on his return Bt!
to Constantinople, but later on it became known
thatthe massacres of April, 1909, had been planned,
prepared, organized and carried into execution by
the Constitutional Government of what has been
called ‘Liberal Turks” or ‘* Young Turks.”
