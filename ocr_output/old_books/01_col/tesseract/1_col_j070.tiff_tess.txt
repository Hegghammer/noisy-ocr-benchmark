Strand 1—Over 1, under 2, over 2, under 2, and so on.
Strand 2—Over 2, under 2, over 2, under 2, and so on.
Strand 3—Under 1, over 2, under 2, over 2, and so on.
Strand 4—Under 2, over 2, under 2, over 2, and so on,
This completes the series or unit, and this unit repeats itself until
the area is woven. For instance, the fifth weaver follows the

diagonal effect will remain the same were the weaver to run over
