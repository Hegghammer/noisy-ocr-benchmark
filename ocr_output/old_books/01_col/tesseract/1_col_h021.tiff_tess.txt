Preface.—Introduction. 1S:
THE OLD BIBLE.

Perhaps the most interesting relic left by our good old ancestor,
Barnabas, is the oLp Bip.e, which he brought with him from England.
It is now in the possession of the Hon. Silas Horton, of Southold.
Tt was taken to the Bible House, New York, some years ago, and care-
fully repaired, and every torn leaf mended, so that it is now entire,
and in a good condition.

We find in it the following record:

“Tmprinted at London, by the Deputies of Christian Barker.”
Printer to the Queen's Most Lxcellent Majestic, 7597.
Cum PRIVILEGIO.

Then follows in manuscript: ;

“ Barnabas Horton, to his son Jonathan Horton, this BinLE he did bequeath, in

“Feb, 8, in the year 1742, then Jonathan Tuthill departed this lfe—the son of
Henry Tuthill and Bethia (Horton) Tuthill. Susanna Tuthill, wife of Jonathan
Tuthill, departed this life May 16, in the year 1743, in the 50th year of her age.
Henry Tuthill, departed this life the 4th day of January, in the year 1750, aged $4.
Bethia Tuthill, wife of Henry Tuthill, departed this life March 16th, 1744, in the
73d year of her age.”

OLD MUSKET, CASK, AND WALKING STAFF.

The old wooed hooks are still attached to the big beam of the old
house, upon which Barnabas used to hang his oLp MUSKET, which was
