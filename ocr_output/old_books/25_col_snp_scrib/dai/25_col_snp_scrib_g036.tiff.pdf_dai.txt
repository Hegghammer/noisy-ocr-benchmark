fasci
Spanish the tradition relates to Spaniards,
and that the former is a Spanish designation of
the locality of the people to whom it relates.
The settlement of de Luna was the only Span-
ish settlement with which the Indians could
have come in contact before Arriola's. That
settlement, therefore, must be the subject of the
Indian tradition, and the Spanish name Pensa-
cola must have been its name.
