THE CHILD OF THE MOAT
world for these many years,' father said, 'but, little
maid, do not trouble your head about it now; when you
are older we can talk about it.'''
"Are the heretics such very wicked people then, do
you think, Aline?"
Aline put her little white hand to her chin and looked
down. "do not know what to think about it," she
said. "I suppose that they are, but they do not seem
to be treated fairly."
"I hate unfairness," said Audry in her impulsive way.
"I do not see why they should not be allowed to speak
for themselves, and I do not see how people can condemn
them when they do not know what their reasons are for
Thinking what they do. Of course I am very young and
do not know anything about it; but it sounds as though
the priests were afraid that the truth can not take care
of itself; but surely it cannot be the truth if it is afraid
to hear the other side. I remember a motto on the chim-
ney piece at home, Magna veritas est et prevalebit,'
and it seems to me that it must be so. I wish that father
were alive to talk to me. He was so clever and he un-
derstood things."
"But you have not said what your motto means," Au-
dry interposed.
Aline laughed through the tears that were beginning
to gather,"Oh, that means, The truth is great and will
prevail. If it is the truth it must win; and it can do it
no harm to have objections raised against it, as it will
only make their error more clear."
"What about the book, Aline?'' said Audry, changing
the subject; "no one is likely to come up here now, they
never do; so I think we could have another look at it."
