CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS
DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.
THAT there has hitherto existed no grood book of Engravings of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the progress of the student in that department of Art, is to be regretted. The talents
of Mr. JOHN SCOTT, brought into action by those of GILPIN, COOPER, and the REINAGLES,
have presented the public with excellent representations of the distinguished ornaments of the
turf: the sports of the field, and the habits and manners of the canine race, weve also duly
honoured but of the ferocious TIGER tribe, and the lordly LION, * hav nothing extant that
would bear critical inspection, beyond a few detached Printe -nothing like a collection of
figures, whose justness and accuracy of forma noton, character, and expression, might be

They have been taken too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
Nor is this intended nimpugn the merits, as historical or poetical painters, of those distinguished
Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that as a painter of allegory, RUBENS
might consider that strong infusion of human form, character, and expression. by which his Lions,
