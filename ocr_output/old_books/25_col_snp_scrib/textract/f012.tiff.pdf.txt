PREFACE
from Smith, who himself was prone to include
the most extraragant myths in his pages, calls,
Pasting
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE Lives AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAMOUS
HIGHWAYMEN. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the "truth" of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.
No one has ever reprinted those authors in
then extraragance, or their grossness.
It would be impossible; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
them, or even written an independent history of
the highwaymen. When we consider how astonish-
ingly popular those l'omances have ever been
Z
which have had Claude Du Vall, and Turpin,
and their like for heroes, this is not a little
surprising.
Perhaps the task has been abandoned because
of the difliculty-the almost insuperable difficulty
N.
-of sifting fact from fiction, and because of a
chatling sense that it would be a thankless task
to present the highwayman as he really was : a
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No morrist would
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dis-
service ; lind do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
