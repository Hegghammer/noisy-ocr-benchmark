was a race up to that time antong non-Moslem peoples which with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who
commerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase the of
ung
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few among them justly started an agitation these our nohle
and industrions brethren were being massacred. What a battor scene! When wre
left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our menian compatriots being
removed in legs and arms were hanging down outside. This hloody seene will
ever remain impresse on ny mind.

This shocking crime of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a cursed absolutism, up to the last moment, grew wider. Even during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feelings which had been shown,
the awful events in Adana took place and the souls of all true Osmanlis melted into tears.
Up to the present time the deep sorrow cansed by this event has not disappeared, because this
bloody wound in our social body eannot easily be cured. While we fill our stommehs with
choice morsels, while we rest selfishly in our comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans, widows hungry, maked, and barefoot wander hither and thither, and thousands of
families are fleeing from the fatherland. We are convinced that the government is doing
work, but what has happened is so great a calamity that it ean keep a government hu y for
years. However much sacrifiee we may make, still it will be inadequate, becaus the
happiness of the fatherland depends on healing such blood wounds as these as soon its possible,
We are convineed that the government and all connected with it are persuaded of this as well as
onrselves. We must now wipe out the traces of the misfortune brought by a eursed period.
We must now comfort weeping hose who do not
Perstand that patriotism and brotherhood do not differ from each other. The responsibility
of the governinent for the Armenrans is very great and very weighty. The whole Ottoman
nation is under obligations to protect this suffering race, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
part due to the blood shed by the Armenians. We thought that these truths
were so obvious that we profer red to keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary from time to time to recall the greatness of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yesterday has endured only barbarism, and for twelve
years
has been constantly oppressed and ground to the earth, and has given thousam) of victimis.
Hereafter we must work to assure them that the era of massaeres has passed, and with all our
strength of mind and soul we must quiet them. The obligation of the govornment protec
them is also very heavy, hecause our Armenian countrymen livo among waindering trines.

We must all assist the government and point out its oblication It must be declared
in
public and periodically that the one of the most important duties of the Ottoman nation is to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and property of the
Armenians as well, since these are their saered rights. Let investigations be made and let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim."
This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare disclose
mnnm
his identity ; and the account given by an authority like Mr. James Bry
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as les Massacres occasionnès par les aventuriers Arméniens."
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
