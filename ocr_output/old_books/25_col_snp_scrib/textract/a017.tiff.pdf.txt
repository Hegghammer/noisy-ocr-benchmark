nine Christian villages which clustered about Kessab in the valleys below of these
have been completely destroyed by fire. All have been no the helpless people
driven out or slain."
Can you the feelings of the Kessab people as they climbed ou foot the long trail
up the nonntain and then as they eame over the ridge into full view of their charred and
ruined
dwellings
Their stores of wheat, barley and rice had been hurned ; clothing, cooking
utensils, furniture and tools had gone; their goats, cows and mules had been stolen ; their silk
industries stamped out their beloved churches reduced to smouldering heaps, The bodies of
their friends and relatives who had been killed had not been buried. And yet the lore of
home is so strong that the people have >ettled down there with the deternination to clear up
the debris and rehuild their houses.' -Extracts from The Sack of Kessab," Stephen Yan R.
