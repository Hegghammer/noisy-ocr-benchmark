babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and butchered
with the cries of the dying agony of their murdered children? Koing
before the eyes of their mothers, or that the ears of mothers should be rent
Humanity, does Christianity allow that helpless women should be forcibly
subjected to the most hideous, the most loathsome, revolting, and
the
most cruel outrages Does Humanity, does Christianity, allow all this?
Christian Governments have organized a Hague Conference of Peace
and Civilization, Vut they have. closed its doors to the cause of a bleeding
christian race groaning under the yoke of the cruellest oppressors that the
world has yet known. Christian men and women have held up their hands
in horror at the Indian Juggernauth; but alas ! the political wheels of
Christian Governments have been a Greater Juggernauth for a helpless
christian race. It is by Christian Governments that "we are made as the
filth of the world, and as the offscouring of all things unto this day.' It is

Christian Powers should be all gathered together, one grainst another, in the
B1
Empire of your Oppressors, as eagles gather together ound a carcase;
but
really there is no help for it; and if you must de bideously by a hellish
extermination, why then you must die, and we have to condone your hellish
extermination, for in any case, each one of us must secure his own politica
and commercial interests in this same Emaire of your Oppressors."
