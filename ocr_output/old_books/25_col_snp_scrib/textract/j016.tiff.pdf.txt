Thruout the seven operations it is necessary that the cane be ker

Step 3. This step is a repetition of the first two. The canes o
this series run over the first and second series and parallel with th
first. As each strand is used up bind the end by pulling it under
a cane, crossing from one hole to another underneath the frame
and cutting off about 1/4 in. from the cane, Fig. 5 shows how this
binding is done. The loose end at the starting point is tied in thi
way, and all subsequent ones should be tied as they come, thu
avoiding interference by many pegs, and insuring neat binding.
Step 4. The actual weaving begins with this step. It may b
done entirely by hand, without resort to the needle, but it is sloy

work. The needle should be used. Start at a hole next to a corner
on either rail that has been used but once, working from caned side
toward the open frame. Go over and under the strands necessary
to form the weave, turning the needle from side to side in order to
catch the canes behind the point. When across thread the needle
with the strand and pull thru, being careful to avoid a twist. Pull
the end down thru the hole, pairing the canes. Pull the cane up
thru the next hole; then start the needle from the opposite side of
the frame and repeat the first operation, thus pairing another set
of canes. Continue until all canes are paired and all holes used.
Soak the woven cane with a wet sponge, and with two pegs
straighten the strands of cane and force all pairs together. Small,
