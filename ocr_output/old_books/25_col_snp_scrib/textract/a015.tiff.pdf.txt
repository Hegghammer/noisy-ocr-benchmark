DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE.
I have thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested witnesses.
We are having a perfectly hideous time here. Thousands have been murdered-
in
this provinee they say but the number is probably greater, for every village
was
wiped ont In Adana about 5000 have perished. After TAks and Armenians had
made pence, the Turks eame in the night with hose and kerosene. fire to what remained
of the Armenian quarter. Next day the French and Armenían schools were fired. Nearly every-
one in the perished, anybody trying to escape being shot down by thesoldiers.
66 The Turlish Auhorities do nothing except arrest moffending Armenians, from whon
by torture they extort the most fanciful confessions. Even the wounded are not safe from
their
injustice.
I man was being carried in to me yesterday when he was seized and taken
off to gaol. I dare not think what his fate may be.
For fiends incarnate commend me to the Turks. Nobody is safe from them. They
murder babies in front of their mothers: they half murder mei, and violate the wives while
the husbands are lying there dying in pools of blood.'
" The authorities did nothing, and the soldiers were worse than the crowd, for they were
better armed. One house in our quarter was burned with 115 people inside. We counted
the bodies. The soldiers set fire to the door, and as the windows had iron bars, nohody
could get ont. Everybody in the house was roasted alive. They were all women ma
children and oll neople."-Extraet from letter of Mrs. Doughty-Wylie wife of British Comful
at Adana ; published in the London Daily Mail.'

History repeats itself. In 1895 Turkish soldiers fell upon seventy to eighty young
women and girls in a church, where they had fled for refuge, and after hidcously outraging
them, barricaded them in, setting fire to the building at the same time, and derisively shouting
to their victims as they were being roasted alive, to call upon their Christ to saye them 110W
