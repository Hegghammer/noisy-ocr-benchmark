Blow folloired blow. Hardly had the remmant of the Paur People escaped from
destruction, and Golitzin was sent to Tiflis as governor-general to carry it out. Church
property to of £1,000,000 was seized by violenee, the Katholikos resolutely refusing
to give IIP the kersof the safe where the title deeds were kept (June, 1903). For two years
the Russiar officials played with the revenuis, retaining eiglity per cent. for their own
advantage. But in the mean time assassination had rid the earth of Plehve, and the over-
whehning defents of Russia in Manehuria were attributed to the Armenian eurse. Grudgingly
the Church property was restored, in utter chacs, and for the moment it is Russin's policy to
favor the Armentans as a balance against the Georgians, whom the St. Petersbarg government
is now deternimed to destroy.
mmm on which the worn old man, stretehed on his monastic bed, looked
back that winter's morning. Singleness of aim has its reward in spiritual peace, but of the
future he was not hopeful. Ile no longer eve contemplated an autonomoas Armenit, oither
on Turkish territory or on Russian. On the Russian side of the frontier the
villages were too scattered, too much interspersed with Georgians and Tartars, to allow
of autonomy. On the Turkish side, he thought, massacre and exile had now left too few of
the race to form any kind of community. Indeed, for the last twelve years the Armenian
villagers have been crawling over the foot of Ararat by thousands vear to escape the Kurds,
and every morning they conie and stand III fresti groups of pink and blue rags outside the
monastery door where the head of their Chureh and race lies dring. They stand there in
mute appeal, as I them, possessing nothing in the world but the variegated tatters
that cover them, and their faitli in their Katholikos. Slowly they are drafted away into
Tiflis, Baku, or their Caucasian villages, but nowhere are ther welcomed,
Some of the bishops and monks, who form a council round their elrief, still look for
Europe's interference, and trust that the solemn pledges taken by Eugland and other Powers
at Berlin may be fulfilled. The Bishop of Erivan, for instance, still Inbors for the appoint-
ment of a Christian governor over the district marked by the ill-omened names off

to concede all the frontier district from Eriyan to Kars, where Limenian villages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day the Cancasus wins federal
autonomy, majority of the Armenian clergy, who litherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political chango, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and industries. One cannot vet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolutionary parties of The Bell and The Flag.' Of
these,
the Social Democratic Bell' follows the usnal impracticable and pedantie creed of St. Matx.
The " Flag," or party of Nationalist Democrats is at present nominant, and at gitat

with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.
Whatever nay be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
