The renvion of Mahommed, the religion of the sword, has been infused

Constantinople, were officially announced to orignate from an affray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed one of the three
given equal numbers and arms, the Armenian is always a match for the
Turk, but alas for him that unequal numbers and want of arms have always
made him the keim of his oppressor.
Ahmed Kiza Bey in the first part (Ses Causes) of his book La Crise de
L'Orient published in Paris in 1907 holds a brief for his nation which
through its own fallacious arguments falls to the ground. I will quote one
passage as an example.
