PREFACE
ix
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific his
torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and exclied the villains, for whom of old no
mud was too thick and slab. Beliefs are being
ussailed on every side. To abolish the traditional
courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the considerate
conduct of Captain Hind would, therefore, be
strokes of the unkindest, and I have here attempted
no such iconoclasm. Even where I cannot be-
lieve, I hare told the tale-whenever it has been
worth the telling-as it is found in criminal
trials, or in Smith
Z
sources, decorously stripped of much vile language.
For really, where much thut seems incredible
may be fully proned, and where the belierable
turns out not rarely to be fulse, 'tis your only way.
To continue the story of the lighwaymen from
Smith and Johnson down to the approaching end
N.
(
of all such things in the beginning of the nime-
teenth century, is like taking up and concli din
a half-told tale. But it was worth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpin has
always maile, has it been found really necessary
to seriously consider and re-state the career of
that muci-oserrated scoundrel, and to put him
in his proper place : (t very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
