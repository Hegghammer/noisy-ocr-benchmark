saw the merchants who had come down the river
in such round boats as we had voyaged in. They
brought casks of the wine of the palm to the market.
And I saw those who had come from Arabia with
spices, and my master would tell me how these
spices had been gathered. Some had frankin-
cense that grows on trees that are guarded by
winged serpents. Only with smoke of burning
styrax could they drive the serpents from the trees.
And others had cassia thatsfoundinashaller in
lake guarded by fierce, bat-like creatures. To
tather it men have to cover themselves all over
with the hides of cattle, leaving openings for their
eyes only. And there are the merchants who have
the ladanum that settles on low bushes, and that
sticks to the beards of he-goats that go amongst
the bushes. Others have the cinnamon that is
used by birds to build their nests against
hish
cliffs. Men cannot climb these cliffs to gather the
sticks of cinnamon, but they make the birds bring
into their nests such weights as break the nests
down and so strew on the ground the sticks of
cinnamon. They slaughter cattle under the cliffs,
