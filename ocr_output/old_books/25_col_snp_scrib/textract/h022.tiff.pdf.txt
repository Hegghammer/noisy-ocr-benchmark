Southold. It is still a long old gun, though not as long as it was
once, as it was bursted by overloading on one Thanksgiving Day, and
about eight or ten inches of the muzzle cut off.
The CASK, in which he packed a portion of his househok
Rassiunt
and brought over with him, is still in existence, and is owned by
Gilbert W. Horton, of Bay View, Southold. It is doubly historio
from the fact that when the British invaded Long Island it was filled
with wheat and buried, thus securing the wheat from the foraging
parties of the British army. It is made of solid ak-hoops and all-
the hoops are square and about an inch and a quarter thick-only one
hoop missing. It is used for a grain cask, and will hold about fifteen
bushels. It was formerly called "uncle Barney's money barrel," as
romance had it, that he brought it over full of gold and silver.
His WALKING STAFF is still preserved. It is made of the Yew tree
wood, has a fine ivory head with the letters CJ. H. and the figures
1617" in apparently golden specks indented into it, from which it
would seem that it once belonged to his father, and that J. H. (Joseph
Horton) were his initials. It is now owned by Silas R. Horton, of
Goshen, N. Y.
Many other mementos of the old uritan are In existence, some of
Z
them in the Long Island Historical Rooms, Brooklyn, N. Y.
THE HORTONNAME-FIRST.SETTLERS IN THIS COUNTRY.
l'he word Horton in the Anglo-Saxon language means an enclosure,
or garden of vegetables. It is said to be derived from ort and tun,
ort, meaning plant, and tun, enclosed. The name is evidently of
vr
Latin origin, and has been known in England ever since conquest
of Cassar.
O
The Hortons in England, and their descendants in America, have
generally been cultivators of the soil. They have been found almost
universally in the middle class of society, and it is not known that
any royal blood has ever coursed in their venis. They atc, and always
have been, producess rather than consumers, and for industry, integ-
rity, and piety, they will lose nothing in a comparison with the re-
nowned families of either the new or the old world.
The first of the family who emigrated to this country, of whom we
have any authentic record, came over from England 1633 to T638.
Thomas, Jeremiah, and Barnabas, were among the early emigrants,
and old tradition says they were brothers. Thomas came over in the
" Mary and John," in 1633, settled permanently in Springfield, Mass.
