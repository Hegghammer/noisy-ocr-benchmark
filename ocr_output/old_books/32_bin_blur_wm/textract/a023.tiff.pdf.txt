org); except to call them fiends incarnate : and who is the bold man who
can guarantee that these same fiends incarnate have become metamorphosed
and changed all of a sudden ; or that the handiful of liberal Turks at Con-
stantincple are capable of controlling and restraining them. IVe have not
even heard that the leaders and participators of the last massacres have
been punished as they deserved : and what is the reason they are left an-
punished ? because the Government is atraid to punish Mahommedans for
killing Christians ; because the liberal Turks dare not punish the true
believers for killing " Kaftirs.
The religion of Mahommed, the religion of the sword, has been infesed
into the Turk, and to understand the eficct of the religion of Malcommed
upon the Turk, it is necessary to regard it from four aspects, or from four
points of analysis. First, the fundamental doctrine and law of the religion.
Second, the character of the founder as an exaniple to his followers. Third,
the racial and ethnographic characteristics of the Terk. Fourth, the effect
which this particular religion would be likek to have on this particular race.
When we have viewed the Turk and his government from these four points
of analysis, we have the explanation of all the woc and desolation which
have lain over the countries under rule.

Turk has religiously and steadfastly made his creed.
In conclusion, I illi ash my readers to compare one point of ditterence
between the tiro races, the oppressor and the oppressed. Thousands upon
thousands of Armenian women, thousands upon thousands of Armenian
children, have been hounded to dieath, or savagely, fereciously, horribly and
loathsomely maltreated by the Turk. and yet in all the agonizing years when
Massacre has succeeded upon Massacre, has there been one known case or
one single instance of a Turkish woman or child maltreated by Armenians
The last massacres though especially organized from the Palace at
Constantinople, were officially announced to originate from an affray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed one of the three :
given equal numbers and arms, the Armenian is always a match for the
Turk, but alas for him that unequal numbers and want of arms have always
made him the victim of his oppressor.
Ahmed Riza Bey in the firs: part (Ses Causes) of his book La Crise
de
L'Orient' published in Paris in 1907 holds a brief for his nation which
through its own fallacious arguments falls to the ground. I will quote one
passage as an example.
