THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
IRMENIAN PEOPLE
During a period extending over thirty years the civilized world has
heard of Turkish Massacres of Armenians. Massacres of a nature so
ferocious and diabolicai. so bidcous and revolting. that no pen could adequate-
ly describe their horrors
Writing in 1S96, Mr. James Bryce, in his supplementary chapter to the
1th edition of his book " Transcaucasia and Ararat' makes the following
grave comment :-
Twenty years is a short space in the life of a nation. But these

The land of the Euphrates and Tigris, that Araxes valley, where. as simple
and primitive Armenians will to this day assert in unshaken belief. God made
main in His own image. and the country reund the base of Ararat, where the
generations of men once more began to people the carth.
Once the land of Ararat was an independent kingdom until the tide of
victory rolled over it and conquered its independence. Hemmed round by
three Great Empires, Russian, Turkish and Persian, the unfortunate geo-
