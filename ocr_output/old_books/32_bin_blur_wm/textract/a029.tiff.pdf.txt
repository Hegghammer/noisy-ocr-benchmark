PART I.
THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TRENTY ()] BERLIN
Since the gathering of the Pleni: otentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in IS;S, and the signing of the still more tamous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands withe ut
it; parallel in history.
In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs of picture of the memorable scene
witpessed in that city on July the thirteenth ISFS. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of Europe.
but in the interests of Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of Berãin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).
I: 11.19 a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of "the
terrible stronghoid of Kars," universally admitted to be one of the greatest
and most difficult military exploits ever achieved, and the crowning sticcess
of the Russian arms in Asiatic Turker shouid have been accomplished by
an Armenian General: that aithougl Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest, anil Armenian soldiers fought, conquered and
died, yet by these successes not only was no amelioration attained of the
hard tate of their unbapps Dation under Turkish rule, Lut that fate, hard
before, was made a hundrediald and even it thousandfold harder.
