When this book was written, the writer was
under the supposition then generally current that
the Anmenian Massacres of April, 1909. in Cilicia
were instigated by Abd ul Hamid and his Yildiz
Crique. Babikian Effendi, the Armenian deputy
who went to Adana from Constantinople to in-
vestigate into the massacres, plamly reported that
all investigations bad failed to trace them to Abd ul
Hamid and his Yildiz Clique. Babikian Effendi,
as was to-be expected, died sud-enly on his return
to Constantinople, but later on it became known
th it themassacrese of April, 1909. hadbeen planned,
prepared, organized and carried into execution by
the Constitutional Government of what has been
called " Liberal Turks" or Young Turks."
