THE ZONE
Avert Thy gazo, () Gord, clare tight Thine eyes!
Glaner down no longer on the oceat, foam
Lest Thon behold such horrorv av can turn
Men's burning hearts to ier, and chil theit
Keep Thing heart warm, and full of
That Thon mayÄ±t yet be able to do
And pity feel for those who is
To pause in dreds of rathless actilor
Restrain Thy wrath, and keep Thane hand in
Suite net, not fiercely thrast without the pale
Than who can dare to strew the oral
With fellow creatures, infocent of
Forget the studed purpose to desiny,
The launching of the massle through the deep,
The shattered ball, the crushed and bleeding formy,
The wothing swirl of wreckage, women, men
