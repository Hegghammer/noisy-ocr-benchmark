Remember that they know not what they do
Who stake in deadly fear and ghastly hate.
Remember that wer chow, and at være time,
Each eſtn e exacts its human penalty
mark
Remember that tan's conscience and mat
Are agents of Thy purpose and Thy pla
Which work within a deadlet rever
Than any shraj nel shot or wbre throat.
Remember that new generations come
Upon whom fall the burden and the curse,
The anguish of old hatredy and pot wrongs,
The crashing debt, the strugate and deya.:.
Restrain, O God, the sweep of this vast hate,
Recall the nations to their sense of shame
To these
ein blinking war, to aval pesce,
Reveal anen the menage of the Christ
Wita vo Gaznimn
