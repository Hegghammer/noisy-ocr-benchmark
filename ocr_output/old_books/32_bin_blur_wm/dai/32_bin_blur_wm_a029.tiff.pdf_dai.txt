TREATY OF BERLIN.
Since the gathering of the Pleni; otentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the still more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without

witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of Europe,
but in the interests of Humanity there should be attached to that painting

the Constitution that he was on the eve of granting to
his people were influenced by Melikett: but after the
death of Mexander 11 he was not allowed to continue in
his good work of reforming Russia, being overthrown
from office early in the reign of Alexander II.
