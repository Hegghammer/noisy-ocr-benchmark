Canaan shall be his servant."
For the interpretation of this blessing of Noah's to his eldest son, and
of how it may or may not have met with its fulfilment, I shall leave to
theologians to discuss, and only record it here as a quotation from Genesis.
Beyond the story of his connection with the flood, and this blessing with
which his father blessed him, and the genealogy of his sons, we read nothing

whence his descendants began to spread and people the earth.
Tradition has woven a romance round the names of towns and villages
in Armenia. "No aighee (Noah's vineyard) is the name of a village
