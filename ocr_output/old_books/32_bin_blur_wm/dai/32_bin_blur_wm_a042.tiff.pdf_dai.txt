last great speech of his heroic life. England attempted some kind of protest. Bat rather
than join the Liberal demand for action, Lord Rosebery left his party for private leisure, and
Russia, France, and Germany combined to secure immunity for the "great assassin." It
was the lowest point of Earope's shame.
Blow flowed bloww. Hardly had the remnant of the Armenian people escaped from
massacre when their Church fell under the brutal domination of Russia. Pichve ordained its
destraction, and Golitzin was sent to Tiflis as governor general to carry it out Church
property to the value of £5,000,000 was seized by violence, the Katholikos resolutely refusing
to give up the keys of the safe where the title deels were kept (June, 1903).
For two years
the Russian officials played with the revenues, retaining eighty per cent for their own
advantage. But in the thean time assassination had rid the earth of Plehve, and the over-
whehaing defeats of Russia in Manchuria were attributed to the Armenian curse. Grudgingly
the Chuch property was restored, in niter chacs, and for the moment it is Russia's policy to
favor the Arinenians as a balance against the Georgians, whom the St. Petersburg government
is now determined to destroy.
Such was the past upon which the worn old man, stretched on his monastic bed, looked
back that winter's morning. Singleness of aim has reward in spiritual pence, but of the
fature he was not hopeful. He no longer even conts

Audged, for the last twelve years the Armenian
villagers have been crawling over the 
foot of Aracat by thousands a year to escape the Kurds,
and every morning they come and stand inin 
fresh groups of pink and blue rags outside the
monastery or where the hend of their Church and race lies dying. They stand there in
mute appeal, as I saw them, possessing nothing in the world but the variegated tatters
that cover them, and their faith in their Katholiks. Showly they are drafted away into
Tiflis, Baku, or their Caucasian vilages, bat nowhere are they welcomed.
Some of the bishops and monks, who form a counell and their chief, still look for
Europe's interference, and trust that the solema předges taken by England and other Powers
at Berlin may be fulfilled. The Bishop of Erivau, for instance, still labors for the appoint-
ment of a Christian governor over the district marked by the ill-omened names of Van, Bitlis,
and Eizerou I also found that even among the Georgians there was a large party willing
to concede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian villages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Caucasus wins federal
autonomy. But the majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and industries. One cannot yet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolationary parties of The Beil" and "The Flag." Of these,
the Social Democratic "Bell" follows the usual impracticable and pedantic creed of St. Marx.
The “Flag,” or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a great
assembly held in Erivan last August (1906) they ad pted a programme of land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected laymen. If the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.
Whatever may be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
