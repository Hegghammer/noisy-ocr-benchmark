and maneted shuttle cock of powerful bats.
Much has been written and much has been said by great authorities,
(far more comprehensively an! by pens much more forcible than my hamble

The name of William: Ewart Gladstone is loved and revered by Armenians
all over the world; but the thunderings of that veteran statesman and the
denouncing protests of those thoughiful men whose feelings of revolted
humanity have made themselves heard in sounding language, have fallen on

ness. Europe has turned a deat ear to the condemnations of justice and
teath, even as she has turned a deaf ear to the voice of Rahel weeping for
ber slaughtered children.
