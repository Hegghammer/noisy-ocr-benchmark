Forther in answer to Aimed Riza Bey's account of the .\rmenian
“pretendus patriotards “in connection with the Ottoman Bank ; feannot do
better than quote from Mr. Bryce's version of the story, and the massacre
that followed: t In the following June serious trouble arose at Van, where
some sortof insurrection is said te have been planned, though in the discre-
pancy of the accounts itis hard to arrive at the truth. Masses of Kurds
came down threatening to massacre the Christians, and a coatlict in which
many innocent persons perished, was with difficulty brought to an end by
the intervention of the British Consul. A httle later the Armenian revolu
tionary party, emboldened by the rising in Crete, where the Christians, being
well armed and outnumberine the Muslims, held their ground successtully,
issued appeals to the Embassies and to the Turkish Government to introduce
refonns, Ureatening Cisturbanees if the policy of repression and massacre
was persisted in, “These threats were repeated in) August, and ultimately,
on August 26, a band of about twenty Armenians, belonging the revolutionary
party, made a sudden attack on the Impertal) Ottoman Bank in Constan-
tinopie, declaring they were prepared toholdiic and blow it up) should the
Sultan refuse their demand. ‘They captured the building by a coup ae nari,
but were persuaded by the Russian dragoman to withdraw upon a promise
of safety. Meanwhile the Goverament, who through their spies knew of the

of wnom had recently been brought to the city—together with the lowest
Turkish class. Using the-occasion, they launched this mob upon the peace:

soon after the attack on the Bank thatit had obviously been prearranged,
and the precaution had been taken to employ the Turkish ruthans in different
quarters from those tn which they dwelt: so dhat they might less easily be
recognised. Carts had moreover been prepared ia which to carry off the
dead. For wwo days an indiscriminate slarchter went on, tn which not only
Armenian merchants and traders of the custivated class, not only the indus:
trious and peaceable Armenians of the humbler class, clerks, domestic ser-
vants, porters employed on the quays and in the warchouses, but also women
and children were butchered in the streets and hunted down all through the
suburbs. On the afternoon of the 27th the British Chareeé a Affaires (whose
action throughout won general approval) told the Sultan he would land
British sailors, and the Ambassadors telegraphed to the Sultan. “Then the
general massacre was stopped, though sporadic slaughter went on round the
city during the next few days. The Ambassadors, who did not hesitate
to declare that the massacre had been organised by the Government,
