T will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and relate the story of Ning Aram, who ended his brilliant: reien in B.C.
1796 after ruling over Armenia filty-cight years.

He was a creat and powerful prince, and extended his dominions, and
grew to be so mighty in batde that the neighbouring nations called his
country Aramia and the people were called Aramians, such names as
Armenia or Armenians being no doubt later corruptions.

The tirst victory of Aram was over Neuchar king of Media, whom he
took prisoner and put to death, and made a large part of the country of the
defeated prince tributary to his own. ‘The second victory of Aram was over
Barsham king of Babylon, whom also he took prisoner and put to death.

to us, there seems to be grounds for supposing that the * Aramivans ”
designated by foreign writers us “a people of Semitic race language and
religion, coming trom Northern Arabia and settling in the region between
the western Loundaries of Babylonia and the highlands of Western .\sia"
were no other than the Hai who under their Ning Aram had spread their
conquests and their kingdom into Mesoputamia and even to the shores of
the Mediterranean.

Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when he includes
Northern Mesopotamia, together with the mountainous country of Ararat,
under the name of Armenia, and ia writing of the Armenian boats that
brought: merchandise to Babylon, ne remarks that they were constructed in
Armenia, ta dhe farts above sissyria,
