Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the ‘Turk, we have also in ‘Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this super-added evi, is, the
large neigbouring bodies otf Kurds and Circassians, greater marauders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation of whose lives comprise~
murder and rebbery, and who have through weary centuries unremittinzly
quartered themselves upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits of their labour and toil. Indeed as the Hamidich cavalry which
was established expressty fer the Hemidian massacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized murder, can now find for those habits in
which they were encouraged and trained to indulge by the Hamidian
régime.

Under all such conditions no hope of better days can be forthcoming.
No prospect of better times seems possible, for that unhappy portion ef the
Armenian race whom torce of circumstances keeps on the soil of the
fatherland,

The appointment of Christian, governors over the provinces in-
habited by them might ameliorate some of the evils, or the other alternative,
of allowinz the use of arms to all alike, irrespective of creed or
nationality, would furnish sone means of selfdcfence against the raids
and barbarities of the oppressors; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christian peasant subject to ‘Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his eneies, must remain one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Notthe most ferule
soil, not the most tavourable climatic conditions, not the most assiduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, can bring to the
Armenian peasant under ‘Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
happiness, and security of lite and property, which the law of all civilized
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil.
