earth as other nations? Does Humanity, docs Christianity allow that tender
babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and butchered
before the eyes of their mothers, or that the ears of mothers should be rent
with the cries of the dying agony of their murdered children? Does
Humanity, does Christianity allow that helpless women should be forcibly
subjected to the most hideous, the most loathsome, the most revolting, and
the most cruel outrages? Does Humanity, does Christianity, allow all this?

© Christian Governments have organized a Hague Conference of Peace
aad Civilization, but they have. closed its doors to the cause of a bleeding
christian race groaning uader the yoke of the cruellest oppressors Uhat the
world has yet known. Christian men and women have held up their hands
in horror at the Indian Jugzernauth ; but alas! the political wheels ot
Christian Governments have been a Greater Jugyernauth for a helpless
christian race. Ttis by Christian Governments that “we are made as the

Ieupire of your Oppressors, as cagles vather together round a carcase; but
really there is no hetp for it; and if you must diz hideously by a hellish

extermination, for in any case, each one of us must secure his own political
aad commercial interests in this same lmpire of your Oppressors.”
