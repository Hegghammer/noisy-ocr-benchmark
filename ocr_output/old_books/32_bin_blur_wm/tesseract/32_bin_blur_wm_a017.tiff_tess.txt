“Can vou inagine the feelings of the Nes-ab people as they climbed on foot the fone tail
up the mountain, and then as they came over the ridge inte full view of their clued and
ruined dwellings? ‘Their stores of wheat, barley and rice had been burned ; clothing, cooking
utensils, firnidure and tools had gone; their goats, eows and mules had been stolen; their <ilk
industries stamped out; theie beloved churches reduced to smouldering heaps. ‘Phe bodies of
their friends and relatives whe died been killed had net been buried. Aut yet the love of
home is so strong that the people have vettled down there with the determination to clear up
the debris and aebaild their houses." Extinct. from! Phe Sack of Keesab,” Stephen Van kh.

As these sheets are going through the press there comes news of famine
at Zeitoon. The Rev. FLW. Macullum, American Missionary at Marash,
writes to the Rev. W. W,. Peet, American Missionary at Constantinople, that
12,000 souls in and around Zeitoon are dying of hunger ; they are wandering
about in razs, mixing bran and water, and cooking and eating it, if they can
get even that. Rev. Macullunyvadds, The same story comes to us from ali
sides. As we foresaw ali along, from now on the distress will be greatest.”

If 59,000 were massacred, the list of those who have died ard are dying
of homelessness and starvation will exceed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerated. Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.

The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered in a night attack
by armed Nurds, and the villagers are now reduced to extreme distress. Before
the outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeatedly appealed
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec:
tion tor the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. [tis
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian vilages trom Kurdish and Purkish raiders.
