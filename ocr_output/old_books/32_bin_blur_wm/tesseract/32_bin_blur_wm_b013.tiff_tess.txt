CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS,
DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.

Tua there has hitherto existed no good book of Engravings of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the progress of the student in that department of Art, is to be recretted. The talents
of Mr. Joun Scorr, brought into action by those of Ginrix, Coorer, and the ReiaG.es,
have presented the public wich excellent representations of the distinguished ornaments of the
turf: the sports of the field, and the habits aud inanners of the canine race, were also duly
honoured: but of the ferocious TiGer tribe, and the lordly Liox, we have nothing extant that
would bear critieal inspection, beyond a few detached  prints:—nothing like a collection of
figures, whose justness and aceuraey of form, action, character, and expression, wight be
relied on.

Does any reader imagine that the varions Etchings whieh have been performed—chiefly
abroad —by Artists of no mean ability, may be considered as exceptions? ‘They are not exceptions :
or at best, the number which might be so regarded is but small, and those, for the most part, of
dimensions not accommodated to the drawer of the cabinet, or the shelf of the library.

But they are not objectionable on this ground alone. Speaking of them in the awereeate, the
heavier charge lies against them of being insuiticient to those purposes of taste and information
which are the ends of Art. Even those after Trrtan and after RuBENS (the latter of whom has
perhaps painted a greater number than any other of the old inasters) are far more deficient in
form, character, and expression, than is generally supposed, or than will be easily believed, by
those who have not actuslly compared them with the Lious, Leopards, and Tigers of Nature.
They have been taken too wueh on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
—Nor is this intended toimpugn the merits, as historical or poetical painters, of those distinguished
Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that as a painter of allegory, RuneNs
might consider that strony infusion of Auman form, character, and expression, by which his Lions,
for example, are distinguished, as necessary, or conducive, to his allegorical purposes; or, it is pos-
sible that his knowledge of this animal may not have been thoroughly well-grounded, and that he
may have laboured under early prejudice of mind, or of vision, in this part of his education as a
Painter, and may not have seen Lions as they really are, This is what the writer is most inclined
to believe, (thoueh not to insist); for even in treating the subject of Daniel in the den of Lions—
