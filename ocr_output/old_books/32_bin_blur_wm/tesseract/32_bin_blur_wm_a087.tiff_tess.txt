Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have clusg to their christian faith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure.

The cathedral of Etchmiatzin built by Gregory still stands to-day ; it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, until perhaps
little of the original building may be left, but ic still claims to be the church
built by the patron saint of Armenia. T shall here quote a passage from
“ Historical Sketch of the Armenian Church,” written by an Armenian
priest: ,

“Owing to political circumstances the Armenian Patriarchate had at
times to be transferred to metropolises and to other principal towns of
Armenia. In the year A.D. 452 it was removed to Dwin, in 993 to Ani,
in ring to Rombklah, and in 1294 to Sis. The Niagdony of Cilicia becoming
extinct, and, we having no more a kingdom and no longer a capital town, it
was natiral and proper to re-transfer the See to its own original place, as
the entire nation unanimously desired it. Accordinghy, in the year rggi, it

* was decided by an ecclesiastical meeting that the seat ot the Catholicus should
return to Holy Ftchmiatzin, where to this day has been preserved the
proper unbroken succession from our Apostles and from cur holy lather,
St. Gregory the Hluminator.”

I read the other day in one of the foreign papers published in’ Japan,
the following piece of news : .

“Aa Armenian Church pronounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christian cra, has been discovered ina fair state of preserva:
tion in the neighboutheod of Bash Aparnal.”

Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light on Armenian history.
