Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
‘Turkish rule? To this question, we must answer an emphatic No!

The causes that must operate against any chenge are many and deep-
seated, To the first place it cannot be expected that a few Turks of liberal
ideas (or it may be French polished) at Constantinople, are going to change
the thought and character of the nation. The characteristics of a people
change very siowly, if they ever change at all, and the predominant national
traits of the many blocded modern Turk have been shown to the world to
be, cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a fierce sensuality ; and what is
more than all, and which has to be remembered most, ts, that they are a
people accustomed to the unbridled gratification of their worst passions.

Phe ethnographic traits of the Turkman which history bears out, are
widness and flerceness, and it would not be incorrect to argue that with the
instincts of hts primitive ancestors have becn, assimilated the many cross
currents that run in his veins, into all ef which has been infused the
doctrines of the religion of the sword, a religion which Coes not make for
the peace or well beine of mankind; a religion, also, which assigning one of
the two sexes to the degraded position of being created: solely tor the gross
pleasure of the other, does not make for the exaltation ot mankind.

To quote again the emingot authority previously referred to: * No
Mahomimedan race or dynasty has ever shown itself able to govern weil
even subjects of its own religion, while to extend equal rights to subjects of
a different creed is forbidden by the very law of its being.”

Not the Jewish conceit proclaiming itselt God's elect and chosen, and
originating the name “heathen which it scorned. Not the Christian conceit
emanating from the Jewish source, and Jaying the flattering unction to its
soul of superiozity over the “heathen "of its own time. Not the unbending
caste cxclusiveness of the Brahman across whose path even the shadow of
the despised Sudra falling would be deemed defilement. Not any of these,
can equal the intolerant religious pride of the Mahonmedan, or reach tie
pinnacle of religious self-sufficiency on which he has seated himselt, “To be
a Mahommedan, is enough— Cela suffi.

To any ene who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans, and
intimate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahemmedan is above all things a Mahommedan. His
ichgion is the paramount question in his life, and remains its predominating
feature above everything else. “This should not be surprising, since to. the
‘faithful’ Paradise is secured, and all crimes and transeressions against
“unbelievers " absolved.
