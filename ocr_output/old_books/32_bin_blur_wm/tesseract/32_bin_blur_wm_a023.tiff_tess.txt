orgy, except to call them fiends incarnate ; and who is the bold man who
can guarantee that these same flends incarnate have become metamorphosed
and changed all of a sudden; or that the handful of liberal Turks at Con-
stantincple are capable of controlling and restraining them. We have not
even heard that the leaders and participators of the last massacres have
been punished as they deserved ; and whatis the reason they are left an-
punished ? because the Government is atraid to punish Mahommedans for
killing Christians; because the liberal Turks dare not punish the “ true
believers " for killing “ Kaftirs.”

The religion of Mahommed, the religion of the sword, has been infesed
into the Turk, and to understand the effect of the religion of Mahommed
upon the Turk, it is necessary to regard it from four aspects, or from four
potats of analysis. First, the fundamental doctrine and law of the religion.
Second, the character of the founder as an exaniple to his followers, “Third,
the racial and ethnographic characteristics of the Turk. Fourth, the effect
which this particular religion would be likely to have on this particular race.
When we have viewed the Turk and his government from these four pomts
of analysis, we have the explanation of all the woe and desolation which
have Jain over the countries under Turkish rule.

“When ye encounter the unbelievers strike otf their beads unul you
have mace a great slaughter of them" is a chapter of the Koran which the
Turk has religiously and steadfastly made his creed.

In conclusion, P wilbask my readers to compare one point of ditterence
between the two races, the oppressor and the oppressed. “Thousands upon
thousands of Armenian women, thousands upon thousands of Armenian
children, have beea hounded to death, or savagely, fereciousiy, horribly and
loathsomely inaltreated by the Turk, and yet in all the agonizing years when
Massacre has succeeded upon Massacre, has there been one known case or
one single instance of a Turkish weman or child maltreated by Armenians ?

The last massacres thouzh especially organized from the Paiace at
Constantinople, were officially announced to originate from an aftray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single banded one, oa
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed ene of the three :
viven equal numbers and arms, the Armenian is always a match tor the
Turk, but alas for him that unequat numbers and want of arms have always
made him the victim of his oppressor.

Ahmed Riza Bey in the first part (Ses Causes) of his book " La Crise de
L’Orient published in Paris in) 1907 holds a brief for his nation which
through its own fallacious arguments falls to the ground. TP wul quote one
passage as an example.
