2 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS,

the scene of which, by the way, he has not represented as a royal menagerie, but asa wild,
rocky cavern—his animals partake of the artificial character of which we cannot bring ourselves to
approve.

Of this fact, however, we purpose to exhibit proof with our assertion. Improved versions, to
the best abilities of our Artists, of some of these Lions of RuBENs and the Assyrian king, will here
be introduced, which the reader, who pleases, may compare with the originals. Our second, third,
and fourth Plates are of the number.

The Lions of ReBENS ure humanized. We do not intend to discuss at length whether the
ideality of allegorical painting required this: we only state the fact : yet the opinions which we
felt at liberty to form on the subject, we feel at liberty to utter, So much in apology for using the
licence of asserting that the heads of many of the Lions of Rubens rather resemble those of frowning
old gentlemen decorated with Ramillies wigs ; as if Nature’s journeymen had made manes, and not
made them well. There is a profusion of flowing and curling hair, which seems rather to solicit
the unguents of the perfumer, than to have endured the torrid heats of the desert, or the rough
storms of the forest. ‘The shag of a Lion's mane is a very different sort of thing.

However such dressed Lions may he thought to accord with Alievory, they are demonstrably
at variance with Nature. ‘To be sure, what might become a Lion in the procession of the Cardinal
Virtues, might be rather unsuitable in Iris den, or within the precincts of those wild haunts, where he
is accustomed to roam in his uatural state. We have often read of the fabled Men-bulls, or (Mino-
taurs,) and we find suck on the coiuage of Crete. ‘These allegorical creatures of RUnens, which,
alas! have sometimes been quoted by Artists without half his genius, and placed in savage con-
fliets, or beside their Britammias are a species of Men-lions. Placed among the Sabwan sculp-
tures, they might pass for incarnations of Sol in Leo; but would very ill pass for Leo alone.

Among the observers of this poetic improvewent, or this natural and unpoetical deficieucy, on
the part of Runeys, ‘Pirtay, Jezi0 Romano, and other painters, both ancient and modern; and
of the consequent dexideration on the part of the public, of a cabinet. or library collection of the
nobler wild animals in a state of Nature, so as to answer the purposes of reference, while they con-
duced to the pleasures of ‘Taste, were Mr. Epcan Spipspury and Mr. Tuomas Lanpseer.
Whether or not the public “looked up to them for light” on that subject, (to use the language of
StERNE,) they thought the Public “deserved it;” and they therefore, as the best practical means
of eliciting that light, first copied the general forms and attitudes of most of the wild animals that
appear in this book, from the old masters—generally speaking, from works that are well known
—and then, went to Nature and corrected the details. They carried with them what, in those
ancient masters, Was meritorious in composition, attitude and chiaroscuro, and brought away,
to the best of their ability—superadding it to, and blending it with, the above—accuracy of
detail.
