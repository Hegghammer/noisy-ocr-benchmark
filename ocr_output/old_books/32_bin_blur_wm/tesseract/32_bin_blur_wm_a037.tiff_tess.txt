No one doubts that a creat forward movement ts reaching its culminat-
tiny pointin the destiny of Asia. The West has learnt tts a'bof religion (the
moral and guiding principle of mankind) from the East, and now the East
would fain learn the law of restraint and the law of freedom (the protecting
principles of mankind) from the West Inspired by this fecting the liberal
‘Turks decidedly mean well, and they are animated with a sincere desire to
ensure peace and security of life and property for the heterogencous peoples
under the ‘Purkish sway, bue they themselves have kad to contend and still
have to contend with a fanatical populace.

To the Mahommedan world at large the Caliph of Islam ts the envoy ot
God, the sacredness of whose person must be inviolate. Abdul Hamid, the
astute politician, knew that the security of his sovereignty depended on his
Caliphal rights, and his main policy during the long period of his cxecrable
reign had been directed towards preserving and asserting the same; thus
we can see how his dethronement, which the liberal Turks would gladly have
accomplished simultaneously with the inauguration of the Constitution, had
to be deferred to a Jater pertod, and how tt was necessary for the She k ul
Islam to pronounce the Caliph a traitor to his sacred trust, a violator of the
holy Jaw of the Prophet. before his dethronement could be dared or
accomplished. -

The Christian Armenians in Turkey live in the midst of the followers
of a hostle religion, with no power or force behind them which makes for
protection, Who coes not know that the great numerical prepondesance ot
Hinduism keeps the balance of power in India, and restrains bloody religious
hostilites; and when we review the whole religious history of Christian
Europe, and that ternibly long roll of crimes committed in the name of Ilim
who expounded His religion with the parable of the Good Samaritan. and
the precept of loving one’s neighbour as one’s self, we cannot feel surprise ac
the fanaticrl outbursts of the followers of Mahommed, the founder of a
religion whose doctrines certainly fall short of the humane principles

finculcatcd by the Founder of Christianity. If authentic historical facts prove

to us that horrible and atrocious cruelties have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other religionists, but on fellaw Christians of different
denominations, how then can we expect better things from the Turk unless
some power or force restrain him ?

Christianity has now partly emancipated herself from the ferocities
which darkened and coured the red stream of blcod on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at large, religion is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite,
