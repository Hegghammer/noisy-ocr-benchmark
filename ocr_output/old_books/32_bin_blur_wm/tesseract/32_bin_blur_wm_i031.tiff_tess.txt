Toimean thawe in the staterooms. FP cannot
speak with certainty in regard to the port-
holes on deck Bo TD beheve that the ant best
the atop took brought her down to these
open ports on the starbound ude ond that
she sank imoch more quickly froa. filhng
through thers.

On tay return to the deck PE felt that the
steazser inusat make her final plunge any mo-
tnent now, and is there was nothing more that
could be done on the port side for there was
no diaphac or onler with which to doit I
passed through to the atarbourd side. Men
were stmving to loner the boats wod were
putting worsen and chikdren into them, bat at
seemed tome thatat only wdded horror to
the whole ctuation to pat) people into a
beat that you knew never would be cleared
and which would go down with the stearser;
better leave (hem oa the deck to let) them
take their chance at a picce of wreckage.
