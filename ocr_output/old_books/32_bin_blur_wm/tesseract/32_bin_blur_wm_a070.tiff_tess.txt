In the foregoing pages | have directed my humble efforts to sketch out
what the Powers of Europe have done in the past, and how their actions
have reflected on my unfortunate race.

It is considered good policy now by a certain class of Huropean writers
to ascribe all the horrors of the Armeian Massacres to Hamid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrantas unassailable and unconquerabie as he was
implacable, in short as a sort of superhuman being who swept everything
before him to the consummationof his own despotic will, The reason for
this is not difficult to perceive. They would fain disavow the part Europe
has played in the tragedy, and to do this successtuily it becomes necessary
also to present Turkey to the world now as a paradise (from whence the
tyrant once removed) peopled onty by saints and angels > so we have also
many roseate colored word pictures of Constituconal ‘Turkey,

The murders, deportations and imprisonments of the Turkish revolu-
tionaries, or more correctly reformers, were undoubtedly the sole work of
Abdui Hamid and bis palace clique, but Abdul and his amintons could not
have carried ont that hellish work of wholesale extermination of the

Armenians without the perpetration and) participation of the “Turkish
people. It as true the massacres were originated and organized in’ the
Palace, the Palace clique stirred up religious fanaticism and race hatred, but
the co-operation of the people was necessary ; and the pesple co-operated
in order to plunder and enrich themselves with the worldly goods that the
Armenians always knew how to acquire by their own industry and toil; the
appeal to their marauding and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover casy work fora race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
