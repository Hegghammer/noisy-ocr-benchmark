two, the wall of iron that rises between them is the position of woman. The
Armenian has accepted whole-heartedly the position in which woman has
been placed by the Great Founder of his faith. For seventeen hundred
years unremittingly since Christianity was revived in Armenia by Gregory
the Hluminator, the Christian law with regard to the position of woman has
moulded the thought of the nation, it has left its impress on the nation, and
it is this vital and essential ditfereace between the law of Mahommed and the
law of Christ that like a two-edeed sword has cleaved apart Christian
Armenian from Moslem Turk and Persian.

It East is East, and West is West" it is on account of the social plane
on which woman stands, a social plane that is never so degraded in any
corner of Asia, as it is in the countries where the law of Mahomumed governs.

‘The Armenians ia Asiatic Turkey are scattered and dispersed among
‘Turks and other antagonistic races ; they are. without any military force or
organization lo wrest autonomy from the anilitary and governing power.
‘That Europe should aid their endeavours, or that Turkey should make them
a free gift of autonomy, are both of them absolutely ont of the question.
Then what remains for us?

To hold to our own nationality: and to be subject—Subject to Russia,
subject to Turkey, subject to Persia—What shall it protic us? What wiil
it profit? What doth it profit us? Our strong, clever, energetic men, our
beavuful, intelligent women, when nether chance nor opportunity can enable
our finest and best to-reach the higher rungs of the world’s ladder, and
when as a subject people we must ever remain hewers of wood and drawers
of water, even our Aivasowskis and our Mehikofis have been hnown to the
world as Russians, notas Armenians. Have we a chance of bursting the
tetters? Have we streneth to break the chains? Can we reach the goal
toward which, bleeding and torn, we have been striving, and sull are striving ?
‘These are questions which we must ask ourselves ; looking them soberly in
the face. :

Bat this is not enough: if we must persist in holding to our our national.
ity, we must Icok into ourselves, we must search out and probe our national
failings and our national weaknesses, and find out in what esseotial character-
istics We are wanting as a nation, and so build up national character. Let
us weigh ourselves in the balance, and supply what in us is found wanting.

In the period of less than a decade a Great Power has risen in’ the
Onent. The people ofa small island empire with an empty Treasury have
beaten successtully and disastrously a colossal empire of whom the Powers
of Europe had stood in awe, and against whom not one had ventured single-
handed to engage.
