“God shall enlarge Japhet and he shall dwell ia the tents of Shem, and
Canaan shall be Iis servant.”

For the interpretation of this blessing of Noab’s to his cldest son, and

whence his descendants began to spread and poopie the earth.

Tradition has woven a romance round the names of towns and villages
