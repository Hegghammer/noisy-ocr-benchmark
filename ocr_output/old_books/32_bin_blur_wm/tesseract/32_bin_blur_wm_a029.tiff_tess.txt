PART OL
THE ARMENTAN AMIASSACRIES AND THE
TREATY Ol BERILIN.

Since the gathering of the Pleni; otentiaries of Furope at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the sull more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armentin nation stands withcut
its parallel in history.

In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
Witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1$7$. 0 “Phe painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of Europe,
but in the toterests of Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of Bertin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).

Tr was a curious irony of Fate, thatalthough the taking of ‘the
terrible stronghoid of Kars,” universally admitted te be one of the greatest
and most difheule miitary exploits ever achieved, and the crowning sticcess
of the Russian arms ia Asiatic “Vurkey, shouid have been accomplished by
an Armenian General; that although Armenian Generals ia the Russian
service had led to conquest, and Armenian soldiers fought, conquered and
died, yet by these successes not only was ne amelioration attained of the
hard fate of their unbappy vation under Turkish re, Lut that fate, hard
before, was made a bundredfold and even a tiousandfold harder.
