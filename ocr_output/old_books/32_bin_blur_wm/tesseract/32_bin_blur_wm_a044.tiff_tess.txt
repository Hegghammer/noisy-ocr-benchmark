ARMIENTAN PEOPLE.

During a period extending over thirty years the civilized world has
heard of Vurkish Massacres of Armenians. © Massacres of a nature so
ferocious and diabolical, so hideous and revolting, that no pen could adequate:
ly describe their horrors

Writing in 1896, Mr. James Bryce, in his supplementary chapter to the
qth edition of his book © Transcaucasia and Ararat”? makes the following
