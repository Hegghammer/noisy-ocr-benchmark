the commencement of the third century, that even the luxurious Emperor
Heliogabalus thought it necessary to publish an edict prohibiting the use
of such expensive shoes excepting to women of quality. The women
wore the close shoe or calceus. Gloves, too, as we have seen before,
were known and used in very early ages, and it appears probable that
they were first devised by those whose labours called them to the thick-
tangled thorn coverts, but that they were worn by those who did not
labour is clearly proved by Homer, who describes the father of Ulysses
when living in a state of rest as wearing gloves; but he gives us no
information as to the material from which they were manufactured. The
Romans appear to have been much more addicted to the practice of
wearing gloves than the Greeks, and we are informed that “under the

the lady's toilet was proportionately filled with ornaments for the person,
so that it was called the woman's world.?” They not only anointed

curls appear to have been fashioned with hairpins. The Grecian
virgins used to braid their hair in a multiplicity of knots, but that custom,
as well as painting the under part of the eyelids with black paint, was
