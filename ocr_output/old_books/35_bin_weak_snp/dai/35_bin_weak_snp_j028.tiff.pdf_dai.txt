SEAT WEAVING
Figs. 13, 14, 15, and 17 show pieces of furniture made in manual
training shops by eighth grade boys. These pieces comprise a group,
with the addition of the leg rest shown in Fig. 2 for a library or
living room. The cane in each instance adds materially to the
artistic effect of the problems; they have tone. The cane forms
pleasing groups well related towell related to 
the wood mass. The cane is natural,
the wood fumed and finished flat. The two tones of color are in
perfect harmony.

TABLE
SIDES CANED.
Fig. 16 shows a library table of oak constructed by an eighth
grade boy. The lines are very pleasing and the long vertical
caned panel adds a distinct note to the structure even tho purely
decorative.
Many modifications of the standard weave in caning are in
vogue, but are more or less fads. A rotary" weave is rather preva-
lent on certam types of furniture, as is what may be termed the
â€œspider-web' weave. These are mentioned merely to suggest that
caning is subject to variation. However, the standard weave, of
seven steps, will not be supplanted to any appreciable degree, for it
adapts itself to almost all types of furniture both decoratively and
structurally.
