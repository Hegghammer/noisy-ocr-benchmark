Church, but was also a fearles patriot--a distingmished linguist, an eloquent preachier. and a
thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. 11 l'hen peate was concluded between Tarkey
and Russia, and preparations were being niade for the Berlin Congress, it was bre who,
in
spite of the feared fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the anuals of Armentan history,
At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruck to
leari from official sources that an Armeniam delegation had arrived from Constantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nerces, the Patriarch, their object lieing to request the signatory l'owers of
the Berlin Treaty to force it guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certaiti
important improvements in Armenin,
Abdul Hamid and his advisers were furious at this affront, and Monseigneur Nercès was
summoned to the Palace. It is said that when he received the summons lic simply smiled
and asked one of of liis eurates to read the Burial Service to him, as lie die not expect to
returi
alive. Howerer, he went. No one has ever heard what passed between the Sultan
and himself at the interview suffice it to say that he inmediately summoned the Armenian
General
Assembly and tendered his resignation. This was not accepted by the Assembly,
and, anvidst enthusiastie clicers, he was carried back to his apartments at the
l'atriaréliate.
Meanwhile a peremptory order reached him, signed by the Sultan, to recall the Armeinan
delegation from Berlin. This Mouseigneur Varjabétian point-blank refused to do, and retired
to his private residence at Haskeuy, it village on the Golden Horn. The success of the dele-
gation, howeyer, did not come it to his expectations. The Armenians, as it happened, could
not be heard, bitt they were SO far successful as to have an article insorted in the treaty.
The Sultan and his advisers never forgaye the Patriareli this, though they rould not
openly do mything to him on account of his chormous popularity. Time passed on, and to
all appeliance the incident was forgotten, but it was not SO. One summer afternoon a most
cordial invitation was sent by a verr high dignitary of the Palace, requesting the Archihishop
to dine with him informally. An invitation of this kind could not very well be refused, so
the Archbishop, accompanied only by a body-servant named Vartai, repaired to the Pasha's
house. The Pasha received him at the door and escorfed the visitor with much cerejoony and
extreme courtesy to a privare apartment of the salamlik of his house (the men's quarter=),
where dinmer was served. The geniality displayed by his loot dispelled any fears that the
Archbishop miglit have had as to his personal safety.
After dinner, as usual, coffee was served. Now, this serving of the enflée is rather a
ceremonial according to higli Turkish etiquette, and it is not unusal for griests to bring their
own tchooboukdar (the servant who carries his master's pipe and poucli and also superintends
the making of his coffee. The Archbishop was presented with a (pipe)
tilled
and lighted for smoking, and a servant followed with collee. The Archbishop necepted hoth
with dne compliments to his host, and took a sip at his coffee. Just nt that moment
the
heavy curtains orer the doorway arere throisn apart, revealing the glastly pale face of his
servant Vartan, who cried, in Arnentan, in a voice trembling with emotion,
"Monseigueur,
I did not brew the coffec!
This aras enough for the Archibishop lie pretended to be startled and spilt the coffee, but,
alas ! he had already dimk n small quantity of it. Meanwhile a scullle was goting on behind
the portiene, where his poor servant Vartan was paying the penalty of lis ileration to his
master. Concerning Vartan's whereabouts or lis ultimate end nothing was exer made public
the poor fellow simply vanished. Monseigneur after a short interval thanked
the Pasha for his generous and kind hospitality and took lis departure. On the way home the
was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily summoned. The Patriarch took to his bed,
and lost all lis hair through the effécts of the por-on. Then, one morning, when a servant
