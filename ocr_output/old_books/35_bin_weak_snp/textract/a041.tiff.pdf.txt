like a rouid bow, a great brown ave revealed the inward spirit's intelligence and zeal
quenehed. On his head has a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.
Thus,
near the end of last December, one of a centory's greatest men-Mgrditch
Khrimian,
Katholikos of the Artecian Charch, and soul of the people-slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or The Only-Begotten
is Descended.' From the window of a neighboring room lic might have lookeil across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the viues were now all cut close and buried
for
the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling snow and hurricane that
lind
the
conc of Ararat. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Delage. On
the
shore of that lakc, eighity-soven years aga, Klirimian whs born. In 1821) the
Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sen or land the Sultan still counted as one of the
formid-
able l'owers of Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Grecce from his
tyrauny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom-n
reputation which still rather pathetically surviros throughont the Near East. Long and
stormy
hail been the life upon which the Katholikos how looked back, bit not unlappy, for
from first to last it had been inspired by one ab-orbing and unselfish aim-the freedom and
regeneration of his people. It is true hr had failed.
From his carliest years, when lie had witnessed the terrors uf Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality-such a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance among
the
prosperous and contented of the world. He began as a poet, wandering far and wide through
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of Armenia, visiting Constantinople and
Jerusalemi,
and recalling to his people by his pocins the scenes and glories of their national
bistory.
Entering the monastic order after his wife's denth, he devoted hiniself to the building of
schools,
which he generously threw open to Kurds, the hereditary assassins of Armerians.
For
many
years, while Europe was occupied with Crimcan wars, Austriam wars, or French and
Giernan
wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying from Van to Constantiuople and through the
citics of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presse broken lip, his snered emilems of the Host bung in mockery round the necks
of
dogs. WV hen elected Armenian patriarch of Constantinople (1869), hr was driven from
his office after four vears.
But the cup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiless slangliter of Balgaians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European l'owers could -tand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoued to plead his people's canse before the Congress of Berlin. Though lie
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Europe
beforehand, urging them to create an autonomous nentral state for Armienia, as
they
had
ilone with success for the Lebanon. In London be became acquainted with Gladstone ; lnit
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which hail kindled the lieint of England,
and,
in the Congress itself Khrinian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce
Turkey's definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London anid shouts of it l'aace with Honor,"
and Armenia was left to stew.
So it went on. Detaiued in Constantinople as prisoner, bamished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by lis om people, lie
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last inculculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armeniaus were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake
