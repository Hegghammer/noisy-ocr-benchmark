PREFACE
from Smithi, who himself prone to include
the most extraragant myths in lis pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE Lives AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAMOUS
HIGHIWAYMEN. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the "truth" of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.
No one hus ever reprinted those wuthors in
their original extravagance, or their grossness.
It would be impossible; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
them, or even wcritten an independent listory of
the highwaymen. When we consider how ustonish-
ingly popular those romances have ever been
which have had Clurde Du Vall, and Turpin,
und their like for heroes, this is not (l little
surprising.
Perhaps the task has been abandoned because
of the difficulty-the almost insuperable difficulty
of sifting fact from fiction, and becanse of (l
chilling sense that it would be (< thankless task
to present the highwayman as he really wos : a
fellow rarely heroic, generally fout-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowcardly. No novelist would
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dis-
service; and I do not think the historiun who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
