CHAPTER II
CASING SUGGESTIONS
As weaving progresses difficulty will be experienced in inserting
cane ends in the holes, due to their becoming filled. Force the
scratch awl thru and turn it several times. This will effectively
force an opening.
In many instances long ends of cane remain from one series to
another. These generally, as previously mentioned, should be used
in succeeding steps. There is one limitation. They should he
used provided it is not necessary to carri them over more than four
holes on the under side of the frame. The fewer loose ends left,
the berter, for the caning is thereby neater and better. It is gener-
ally advisable to use a full length strand to avoid a number of
loose ends
The amateur will find his greatest difficulty in properly weaving
the diagonals at the edges; that is, immediately upon entering or
leaving a hole. Many commendable pieces of caning are spoiled
by ragged, improperly woven edges. Care must be taken to see
that the cane gors over and under the proper strand or strands at
these points. Fig. 6 clearly shows how the diagonals should run.
Study it carefully.
The addition of a binder is generally a matter of taste. Perhaps
50 per cent of modern hand caned furniture does not employ a
binder of any description. The series of regularly exposed holes
are trather pleasing and in no way detract. However, in chair seats
a binder is essential to protect the ends of canes, for they are subject
to hard wear.
Binders of reed or of wood called "splines" may be used on hand-
caned framesi If either is used a groove 1/4 in. deep and 3/16 in.
