It is said that Barnabas Horton I. was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities.
His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally orer the grave, The stone
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It is elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. The original base was of brick, but it had all crumbled down
many years ago. The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Ilorton,
The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads as
follows:
liere lieth buried the body of MR. BARNAIIAS HORTON, who was born at
Mousely, Leicestershire, Old England, and died at Southold, on the 13th day of
July, 1680, aged 8o years."
In the centre of the stone we find the Epitaph, as follows :
Heré lies my boily tombed in dust
ZTill Christ shall come to raise it with the just;
My soul ascended to the throne of God,
Where with surcet Jesus now I make abode:
Then hasten after me, my dearest wife,
To be partaker of this blessed life;
And you, dear children, all followi the Lord,
Hear and obey lis public sacred word
And in your houses call upon Ilis nanic,
For oft I have advised you to the same.
Then God will bless you with your children all,
And to this blessed place He will you call.
Heb. xi : He being dead, yet speaketh,"
It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the original
thirteen who brought his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and menooy
should not perish from the earth.
