Southold. It is still a long old guin, though not as long as it was
once, as it was bursted by overloading on one Thanksgiving Day, and
about eight or ten inches of the muzzle cut off.
The CASK, in which lie packed a portion of his houschold goods,
and brought over with him, is still in existence, and is owned by
Gilbert W. Horton, of Bay View, Southold, It is doubly historic
from the fact that when the British invaded Long Island it was filled
with wheat and buried, thus securing the wheat from the foraging
parties of the British army, It is made of solid pak-hoops and all-
the hoops are square and abont an inch and a quarter thick-only one
hoop missing. It is used for a grain cask, and will hold about fifteen
bushels, It was formerly called Barney's (noney barrel," as
romance had it, that he brought it over full of gold and silver.
His WALKING STAFF is still preserved. It is made of the Yew tree
wood, has a fine ivory head with the letters H.? and the figures

1617 in apparently golden specks indented into it, from which it
would seem that it once belonged to his father, and that J. H. (Joseph
Horton) were his initials. It is now owned by Silas R. Horton, of
Goshen, N. V.

The HORTON SETTEERS IN THIS COCNTRY.
The word Horton in the Anglo-Saxon language means an enclosure,
or garden of vegetables. It is said to be derived from art and tun,
ort, meaning plant, and tiun, enclosed. The name is evidently of
Latinorigin, and has been known in England ever since the conquest
of Casar.
The Hortons in England, and their descendants in America, have
generally been cultivators of the soil. They havé been found almost
universally in the middle class of society, and it is not known that
any royal blood has ever coursed in their veins. They are, and always
have been, producers rather than consumiris, and for industry, integ-
rity, and piety, they will lose nothing in a comparison with the re-
nowned families of either the now or the old world.
The first of the family who emigrated to this country, of whom we
have any authentic record, came over from England 1633 to 1638.
Thomas, Jeremiah, and Barnabas, were among the carly emigrants,
and old tradition says they were brothers. Thomas came over in the
CMary and John," in 1633, settled permanently in Springfield, Mass.
