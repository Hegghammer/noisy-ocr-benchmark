Vaii, and the lowest estimate counted the nurdered dead at 103,00.). Gladstone made the
last great speech of bis heroie life. England attempted some kind of pratest. But trather
than join the Liberal demand for action, Lord Rosebery left lis party for .private leisure, and
Russia, France, and Germairy combined to secure immunity for the great assassin." It
was the lowrest point of Europe's shame.
Blow followed blow. Hardly lind the remmant of the Armeinan cople escaped from
inassaere when their Church fell onder the bratal domination of Russia. l'lehve ordained its
destruction, and Golitzin was sent to Tiflis as to carry it ont. Church
property to the valne of C16,000,000 was seized by violeuce, the Katholikos resolutely refusing
to give ip the keys of the safe where the title deeds were kept (June, 1903). For tiro
years
the Bussiah officials played with the revenues, retaining ciglity per cent. for their own
advantage. But in the mean time assassination liad rid the earth of Plehve, and the over-
whelming defeats of Russia in Mauchuria were intributed to the Armenian eurse. Grudgiugly
the Church property was restored, in ulter chacs, and for the moment it is Russia's policy to
favor the Armentans as a balance against the Georgians, whom the St. l'etersburg government
is now deternuned to destroy.
Such was the past which the worn old man, stretehed on his mouastie bed, looked
back that Winter's morning. Siugleness of aim has its reward in spiritual peace, bnt of the
fature he was not hopefin). Ile 110 longer even contemplated an autonomous Armenia, either
on Turkish territory or on Russitm. On the Russian side of the frontier the Armenian
villages
were too seattered. too mucli interspersed with Georgians and Tartars, to allow
of autonomy, On the Turkish side, he thonght, massacre anil exile had how left too few of
the
race
to form any kind of community. Indeed, for the last tweive years the Armenian
villagers have been crawling over the foot of Ararat by thousands n year to eseape the Kurds,
and every morning they come and stand in fresh groups of pink and blue rags outside the
monastery door where the head of their Church and race lies dying. They stand
there
in
mute appeal, as I saw thimm, possessing nothing in the world but the variegated tatters
that cover them, and their faith in their Katholikos. Slowly they are drafted away into
Tiflis, Baku, or their Caucasian villages, but nowhere are ther welcomed.
Some of the bishops and monks, who form a council round their éhief, still look for
Europe's interference, and trust that the solemin pledges taken by England and other Powers
at
Berlin
may be fultilled. The Bisliop of Erivan, for instance, still labors for the appoint
ment of a Cliristian governor over the district marked by the ill-onnened naines of Van, Bitlis,
and Erzeroum. I also fonnd that even among the Georgians there was a large party willing
to concede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian villages are thickest,
as
an autonomous Arnicnian proviuce, in the happy day when the Cancasus wins federal
autonomy. Bat the majority of the Armenian clergy, who litherto have led the people,
are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessnes of political change, and are now limiting
their
efforts
to
education and industries. One cannot vet say how far their influence may be
strrassed in the growing revolutionary parties of The Bell' and The Flag." Of these,
the Social Democratic if Bell" follows the usual impracticable and pedautic creed of St. Marx.
The " Flag," or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a great
nesembly held in Erivan last August (190G) they adopted a progranime of land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected laymen. If the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgiau Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the comutry are set.
Whatever may be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religioi. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
