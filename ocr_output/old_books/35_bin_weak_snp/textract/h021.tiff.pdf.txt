THE OLD BIBLE.
Perhaps the most interesting relie left by our good old ancestor,
Barnabas, is the OLD BIBLE, which he brought with him from England.
It is now in the possession of the Hon. Silas Horton, of Southold.
It was taken to the Bible House, New York, some years ago, and carc-
fully repaired, and every torn leaf mended, so that it is now entire,
and in a good condition.
We find in it the following record :
Imprinited at London, by the Deputies of Christian Barker."
l'inter to the Quicen's Most Excellent Majestic, 1597
CUM PRIVILECIO,
Then follows in manuscript :
" Barnabas Horton, to his son Jonathan Horton, this BICLE he did bequeath, in
the year of our Lord, 1680.
Then follows:
"Capt. Jonathau Horton, his Book. God sive him grace. Jonathan Horton, 1683.
In another place, and probably in the handwriting of Jonathan
Horton, Jr., we find :
The Word of the Lord Goil of Fonathan Horton,
Again we find :
Lydia Tuthill, her Book, given her by her mother, as it is said."
And then follows :
Feb. 8, in the year 1742, then Jonathan Tuthill departed this life-ethe son of
Henry Tuthill and Bethia (liorton) Tuthill. Susanna Tuthill, wife of Jonathan
Tuthill, departed this life May t6, in the year 1743, in the 50th year of her age.
Henry Tuthill, departed this life the 4th day of January, in theyear 1750, aged 81
Bethia Tithill, wife of Henry Tuthill, departed this life March 16th, 1744, in the
73d year of her age."
OLD MUSKET, CASK, AND WALKING STAFF.
The oll wood hooks are still attached to the big beam of the old
house, upon which Barnabas used to hang his OLD MUSKET, which was
called "funcle Barney's quart pot." He brought it with him from
England. It is now in the possession of Barnabas B. Horton, of
