may take the place of the awl. A pair of dividers and rule are
necessary for marking. Several wood pegs are needed. These may
be classed with the tools. They are made from a 1/4 in. dowel rod,
or the equivalent. Cut them about 4 in. long and point them as
you would a lead pencil. The amateur is inclined to use a number
of pegs. Four should prove amply sufficient.
Beginning the Operation,-Fig. 2 is a photograph of an up-
holstered leg rest with caned sides. This rest will be used for our
initial work in cane weaving, in-
asmuch as the area for caning is
rectangular. It is not advisable
tor the beginner to have his initial
experience on a chair seat, for the
area is usually of an odd shape,
and arms, legs, and back interfere.
However, any rectangular area
on which there are no projections
to Fother may be used for the first

with glue, without the posts. When the glue has set the proper
length of time, and the frame is cleaned and sanded, the rails and
stiles are ready to dimension.
Draw pencil lines entirely around the inner sides of the rails and
stiles, 1/2 in. from the edges. This distance remains constant,
usually, on all areas and with canes the various widths. With a

It will make clearer the directions. It is fundamental that the
spacing be done in the same direction on parallel rails, for at times
