was a race mp to that time among non-Moslem peoples which with sinecre and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armeniam. It is the Armenians
who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recoguize
the
Ottoman country ns their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engage
in
conmerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, incrense
the
value
of
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few among them justly started an agitation, these our
noble
and industrious bretliren were being massacred. What a terrible scene! When we
left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our Armenian compatriots being
removed in manure carts legs and arms were hanging down ontside. This bloody scene
will
ever remain impressed on my mind.
This shocking crime of Yildiz formied a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a eursed absolutism, up to the last noment, grew wider. Even during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feelings which hail been shown,
the awful events in Adana took place and the souls of all true Osmanlis melted into tears.
Up
to
the
present time the deep surrow cansed by this event has not disappeared, hecause this
bloody wound in our social body eannot easily be eured. While we fll our stoninehs with
choice
morsels, while we rest selfishly in our comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans, widows hungry, naked, and barefoot wander hither and thither, and thousands of
families
are fleeing from the fatherland. We are convinced that the government is doing its
frork, but what has happened is so great a calamity that it can keep a government busy for
years. However mnch sacrifice we may make, still it will be inadequate, because the
happiness of the fatherland depends on healing such blood wounds as these as soon as possible.
We
are
convinced that the government and all connecteil with it are persuaded of this as well as
ourselves.
We must now wipe ont the traces of the misfortune brought by a enrsed period.
We
must
now comfort weeping hearts. We must understand and teach those who do not
understand that patriotismi and brotherhood do not difler from each other. The responsibility
of
the
government for the Armenians is very great and very weighty. The whole Ottoman
nation
is
under obligations to protect this suffering race, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
is in large part due to the blood shed by the Armenians. We thought that these truths
were
so
obvious that are preferred to keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary from time to time to recall the grentness of our obligation. We must
not
forget
that this mhappy people up to yesterday has endured only barbarism, aud for twelve
years
has been constantly oppressed and ground to the carth, and has given thousands of victimis.
Hereafter we must work to assure them that the era of inassacres has passed, and with
all
our
strength of mind and soul we mast quiet The obligation of the goverument to protect
them is also yery heavy, because our Armenian conntrymen live among wandering
tribes.
We must all assist the government and point out its obligation. It mist be declared in
public and periodically that the one of the most important duties of the Ottoman nation
is
to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and property of
the
Armenians as well, since these are their sacred rights. Let investigations bie munde and let
whatever is necessary he done in order to reach this aim."
This article of the Turkish officer, who howcver does not dare disclose
his identity ; and the account given by an authority like Mr. James Bryce
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahned Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as "les Massacres occasionnés par les aventuriers Arméniens."
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
