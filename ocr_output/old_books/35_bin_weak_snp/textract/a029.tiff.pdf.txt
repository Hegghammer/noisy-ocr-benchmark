PART I.
TIE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN.
Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the still more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel in history.
In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth IS7S. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of Europe,
but in the interests of Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 6i of the Treaty of Berlin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).
It was a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of "the
terrible stronghold of Kars," universally admitted to be one of the greatest
and most difficult military exploits ever achieved, and the crowning success
of the Russian arms in Asiatic Turkey, should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General; that although Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest, and Armenian soldiers fought, conquered and
died, yet by these successes not only was no amelioration attained of the
hard fate of their unhappy nation under Turkish rule, but that fate, hard
before, was made a bundredfold and even a thousandfold harder.
GENERAL FRINCE LONIS MELIKOFF
Commanded the Russiau forces iii Asiatic Turkey
during the Russo-Turkish war and captured the im-
pregnable fortress of Kars. Appointed Prime Minister
of Russia by Alexander II. The liberal policy which
charneterized the reign of that excellent monarch, and
the Constitution that he was 01) the ere of graitting to
his people were influeuced by Melikoft but after the
death of Alexander II he was not allowed to continue in
his good work of reforning Russia, being overthrown
from office early in the reign of Alexamder III.
