" Isaac Horton moved from Colchester to Liberty, Sullivan Co.,
N. Y., 4 and 5 of April, 1826. The snow fell in April, after they
moved, about two feet decp. He had a large stock of cows, sheep and
hogs. In his flock of sheep were twenty-two elves, the finest that could be
found in Colchester, nearly all of them only two years old. He drove
them to Liberty. Wolves were seen on the way near l'arkesville.
He arrived at Liberty Falls-salted his sheep in the evening. The
next morning the shecp were gone, and Isaac and his son Roy, went
up the hill at Liberty Falls to look for them. Before they got beyond
the clearing they found dead sheep scattered along the log fence. and
others dying, Nearly all the flock were killed. They even killed a
lamb in the pen adjoining the house.
16 In 1837, Isaac Horton had thirty-seven grandchildren, all living
but two. His children all' lived to maturity.' (Letter G. B. Horton,
1871.)

Under date of 8 February, 1874, Webb Horton writes, "My mother
is living and in good health. She resides at Liberty, Sullivan Co.,
N. Y. She is in the eighty-seventh year of her age. Her father died
aged eighty-eight, and her grandmother, Prudence Schofield, aged
ninety-four. She has now living ten children, thirty-seven grand-
