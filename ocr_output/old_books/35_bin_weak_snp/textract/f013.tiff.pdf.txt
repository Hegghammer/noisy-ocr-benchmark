PREFACE
ix
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific his-
torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and exralted the villuins, for whom of old no
mud icas too thick and slab. Beliefs (<re being
ussailed on every sile. To "bolish the traditional
courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the considerate
conduct of Captain Hind would, therefore, be
strokes of the unkindest, and I luwe here attempted
no such iconoclasm. Even where I cunnot be-
lieve, I hure told the tale-ichenever il hus been
icorth the telling-as it is found in criminal
triuls, or in Smith or Johnson, and other old
sources, decorously stripped of much vile language.
For really, where nuch that seems incredible
meny be fully proved, and where the belierable
turns out not rarely to be fulse, 'tis your only way.
To continue the story of the highwaymen from
Snith und Johnison down to the upproucling end
of all such things in the beginning of the nine-
teenth century, is like taking und concluding
a half-told tale. But it icorth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpin hus
always maile, has it been found really necessari]
to seriously consider and re-state the career of
that nuch-overruted scoundrcl, and to put him
in his proper place : " very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
