On the field the ever victorious army: of little Japan undermined Russia's
-. stronghold, and ‘succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
~ deféated and ever retreating army of colossal Russia. Atsea the ever
-.-yietorious Japanese Ileet succeeded in completely. annihilating the Russian ~~
Fleet. It-was war such as the world had never yet seen. The secret of.”
~ such astounding successes should be investigated, and here [beg leave to.
~ quote from one of a series of articles in which I gave view to my opinions: |
during the Russo-Japanese War. “Japan may. be likened to the bundle of
faggots in the fable firmly tied together; one faggot of larger dimensions in.
the centre, the sovereign round whom the whole nation clusters, and all,”
~. -tuler and people tied together by adamantine bands of patriotism.”
= These remarks of mine were based on observations of actual-facts. In
~nattonal unity Japan stands as an object lesson to the world;:she furnishes ©.
~ an example which the world needs to copy, and which a nation'so politically
. forlorn as ourselves more than any other needs. to copy.
.- -. From-the astounding success of Japan let’ us turn to the position the 9.
Great Republic of the United States of America occupies in the world, and
- take the lesson to heart of what Union can accomplish as we contrast their
present position with the position that the handful of puritan pilgrims occupied =
~. when they. first landed on American soil not quite three hundred years ago.
National Unity is our greatest need; itis the banner which we must.
raise. up over our national life. National Unity must be engraven on the |
_ tablets of our minds and throb in the pulses‘of our hearts. ‘There are
| mountains of difficulties before us, and if ever we must reach the goal we |
can only do'so by: being bound together. like the bundle of faggots in the ©.
fable, with no weakening or loosening of the bands. Then perhaps we
_ might once more be able to get an independent footing on the historical soil =
of our fathers, and perhaps once more rally round our own flag. A Japan: ©
ese lives for the State, not for himself; we have no State for which to live,
_ but let us live for our communities whilst we keep the hope invour hearts.
that communities grow into States,
We have grit and endurance in an. unparalleled. degree, but these.
characteristics will profit us nothing if we are wanting in unity.
Let us remember that utterance of the Founder of our faith, In our >)
loyalty and allegiance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents ofa
Cataract, but we must remember lis warning utterance:—
~ "AVhat shall it profit'a man.” What shall it profit’a nation. Unity is
_.. the soul of a nation. Let us keep our'scul and not loseit.
