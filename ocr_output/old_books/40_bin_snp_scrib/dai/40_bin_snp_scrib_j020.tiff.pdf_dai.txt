SEAT WEAVING
wide is cut concident with the holes before weaving is begun.
After the area is caned the strips are fitted and glued in. Use little
glue. Tap the splines firmly with a mallet used over a block of
wood, until they are flush with the woven cane. Chapter IV gives
the method in detail.
The size of the holes and the distance between them is deter-
mined largely by the size of the
cane used. Some prefer coarso
meshed areas, while others desire
them closely woven. There is,
however, what we may term a
standard mesh. The individual
may vary the dimensions given to
suit himself. The Jacobean or
early caning was invariably of
coarse mesh.
Carriage and superfine cane re-
quire in. holes and ¾ in. spa-
ces; fine-fine cane requires 3/16
in. holes and ¹½ in. spaces, fine
cane requires 3/16 in. holes and
5 in. spaces ; medium, ¼ in. holes
and 34 in. spaces. Fine-fine and
fine cane are the best sizes for
shop use. A small amount of medium binder is desirable.
One hank of cane will ordinarily be sufficient for a half-dozen
areas of approximately 12. by 12 in.
Most old pieces of period furniture utilizing cane employ a
particularly narrow split horizontally and vertically, and wider
split diagonally. The opposite practice may be employed a finer
split of cane being used diagonally than horizontally and vertically.
Both effects are pleasing.
