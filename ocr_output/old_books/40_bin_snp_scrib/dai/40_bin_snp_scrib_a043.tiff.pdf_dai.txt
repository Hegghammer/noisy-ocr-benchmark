called a powerful nation. For almost as long they have possessed no independent country of
their own. For six hundred years their ancient capital city of Ant has stood a splendid but
empty ruin in the desert between Kars and the great mountain of Alagöz, which confronts
Ararat, with nearly equal height. They have been rent asunder and tormented by Perkins,
Turks, Tartars, and Russians in turn. Even their religion is not nationalistic or distinctly
separate from other forms of religion, like the Jewish. Except for physical shades of
difference, hardly comprehensible to the modern world, there is litle to distinguish it from the
orthodox Christianity of the Near East. Yet, through innumerable disasters and attempts
at extermination, the race persists, like the Jews, with astonishing vitality, unmistakable in
characteristics which may not be exactly heroic, but lead to a certain material success. After
all, it is only in harassed and persecuted nationalities that trae patriotism ever survives.

Catholicos and Supreme Patriarch of
Etchmiatzin. A man of high character and
great ability, also a distinguished linguist.

liarly known as the "Iron Patriarch." Banished
by the Ilamidian Government, he returned
from exile in 1908 and was shortly after elected
Catholicos of Etchmiatzin..
The Armenian Catholicos is not infallible
like the l'ope. He is elected by the nation,
but his appointment is subject to the sanction
of the Czar.
