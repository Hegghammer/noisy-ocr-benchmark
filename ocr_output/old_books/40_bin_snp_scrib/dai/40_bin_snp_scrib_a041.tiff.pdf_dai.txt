like a round bow, a great brown eye revealed the inward spirit's intelligence and zeal un-
quenched. On his head was a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.
Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest men-Merkitch
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or "The ely-Begotten
is Descended." From the window of a neighboring room he night are looked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now a cut close and buried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling suow and hurricane that

Empire was still undiminished by sea or land; the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-

tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom-a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Near East. Long and

From his earliest years, when he had witnessed the terrors of Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round Ararat, he was possessed by the spirit of nationality such a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed races, but dies away into easygoing tolerance among the
prosperous and contented of the world. He began as a poet, wandering far and wide through
the Turkish, Persian, and Russian sections of Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems the scenes and glories of their national history,

wars, we see him ceaselessly journeying from Van to Constantinople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emblems of the Host hung in mockery round the necks

speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited the great courts of Europe
beforehand, urging them to create an autonomous neutral state for Armenia, as they had
done with success for the Lebanon. In London he hecame acquainted with Gladstone; but
