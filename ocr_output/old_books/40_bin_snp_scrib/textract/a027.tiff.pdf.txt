was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples which with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armentan. It is the Armenians
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
commerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase the of
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engage Till img
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few among them justly started an agitation these our noble
and industrions brethren were being massacred. What a scene When
ire
left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our menian compatriots being
removed in manum carts; legs and arms were hanging down outside. This bloody sceire will
ever remain impressed on ny mind.
" This shecking crime of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a cursed absolutism, up to the last moment, grew wider. Even during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feelings which had heen shown,
the awful events in Adana took place and the souls of all true Osmanlis melted into tears,
Up to the present time the deep sorrow caused by this event has not disappeared, because this
bloody wound in our social body eannot easily be cured. While we fill our stonmehs with
choice morsels, while we rest selfishly in our comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans, widows hungty, haked, and barefoot wander hither and thither, and thousands of
families are fleeing from the fatherland. We are convineed that the government is doing its
work, but what has happened is so great a calamity that it can keep a government but for
years. Howeyer much sacrifice we may make, still it will be inadequate, because the
happiness of the fatherland depends on healing such blood wounds as these as soon as possible.
We are convineed that the government and all connected with it are persuaded of this as well as
onrselves. We must now wipe out the traces of the misfortune brought by a eursed period.
We must now comfort weeping those who do not
understand that patriotism and brotherhood do not differ from each other. The responsibility
of the government for the Armenians is very great and very weiglty. The whole Ottoman
hation is under obligations to protect this suffering race, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
IS 111 large part due to the blood shed by the Armenians. IVe thought that these truths
were so obvious that we profer red to keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary from time to time to recall the greatness of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yesterday has endured only barbarismi, and for twelve years
has been constantly oppressed and ground to the earth, and has given thousams of victinis.
Hereafter we must work to assure them that the era of inassacres has passed, and with all our
strength of mind and soul we must quiet them. The obligation of the govormment to protect
them is also very heavy, becanse our Armenian conntrymen live-among wandering tribes.

We must all assist the government and point out its obligation.
It
must
be
declared
in
public and periodically that the one of the most important duties of the Ottoman nation is to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and property of the
Armenians as well, since these are their sacred rights. Let investigations be munde and let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim."
This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare disclose
his identity ; and/the account given by an authority like Mr. James Bryce
surely relute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as 'les Massacres occasionnès par les aventuriers Arméniens."
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
