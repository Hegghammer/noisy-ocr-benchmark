Van, and the lowest estimate counted the murdered dead at 100,000. Gladstone made the
last great speech of bis heroie life. England attempted some kind of protest. But rather
than join the Liberal demand for action, Lord Rosebery left his party for .private leisurerand
Russia, France, and Germany combined to secure immunity for the great assasin. It

was the lowest point of Europe's shame.
Blow followed blow. Hardly had the reimant of the people escaped from
massacre when their Church fell under the brotal domination Russia. Plehve ordained
its
destruction, and Golitzin was sent tr) Tiflis as governor-general to carry it out. Church
property to the of C6,000,000 was seized by violence, the Katholikos resolutely refusing
to
give
up the kers of the safe where the title deeds were kept (June, 1903). For tiro years
the
Russian officials played with the revenues, retaining cighty per cent. for their own
advantage. But in the mean time assassination had rid the earth of Plehve, and the over-
whelming defeats of Russia in Manchuria were attributed to the Armenian eurse. Grudgingly
the Church property was restored, in utter chaos, and for the moment it is Russia's policy
to
favor the Armehians as a balance against the Georgians, whoni the St. Petersburg government
is now deternrined to destroy.
Sinchandens which the worn old man, stretelied on his monastic bed, looked
back that winter's morning. Singleness of aim has its reward in spiritual peace, but of the
future he was not hopeful. Ile no longer even contemplated an autonomous Armenia, oither
on Turkish territory or on Russian. On the Russian side of the frontier the Arnician
villages were too scattered, too much interspersed with Georgians and Tartars, to allow
of autonomy. On the Turkish side, he thought, massacre and exile had HOW left too few of
the race to form any kind of community. Indeed, for the last twelve years the Armenian
villagers have been crawling over the foot of Ararat bv thousands a year to escape the Kurds,
and every morning they come and stand in fresh groups of pink and Dlue rags outside the
monastery door where the head of their Church and race lies dying. They stand there in
mute appeal, as I Saw them, possessing nothing in the world but the variegated tatters
that corer them, and their faith in their Katholikos. Slowly they are drafted away into
Tiflis, Baku, or their Caucasian villages, but nowhere are they welcomed.
Some of the bishops and monks, who forni a council round their elief, still look for
Europe's interference, and trust that the solemn pledges taken by England and other Powers
at Berlin may be fulfilled. The Bishop of Erivan, for instance, still labors for the appoint-
ment of a Christian governor over the district marked by the ill-omened of Van, Bitli,
and Erzeroum. I also found that even among the Georgians there was a willing
to concede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Limenian villages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day Meel the Cancasus wins fedoral
autonomy. But-the majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and industries. One cannot vet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolutionary parties of The Bell " and The Flag.' Of these,
the Social Democratic Bell follows the usual impracticable and pedantie creed of St. Mafx.
The Flag," or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at in great
nssembly held in last August (1906) they adopted a programme of land nationalization
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church propet ty
by elected onner f the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.
Whatever may be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by langunge and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
