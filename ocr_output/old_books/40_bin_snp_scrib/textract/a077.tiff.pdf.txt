I will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and relate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
1796 after ruling over Armenia fifty-eight years.
He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his dominions, and
King
grew to be so mighty in battle that the neighbonting vations called his
country Aramia and the people were called Armians, such names as
Armenia or Armenians being no doubt later corruptions.
The first victory of Aram was over Neuchar king of Media, whom he
took prisoner and put to death, and made a large part of the country of the
defeated prince tributary to his own. The second victory of Aram was over
Barsham king of Babylon, whom also he took prisoner and put to death.
The next victory was over the king of Cappadocia the army of the
Cappadocians was pursued to the very shores of the Mediterranean, and the
fell into the hands of Aram B.C. 1796. Also Ninus
king of Assyria, at one tinie an eager (enemy, awed by the victories of Aram,
sought to cultivate his friendship.

the ancient kingdoms of Western Asia might be known in our day ; and also
when the tide of Islam victory rolled over the kingdom of Armenia, how
much of the story and history of the people was lost and destroyed along
with the destruction of their independence it would be difficult now to calculate
or assert, but in taking up link by link of whatever knowledge has been left
to us, there scems to be grounds for supposing that the or Aramceans'
designated by foreign writers a people of Semitic race langnaage and
religion, coming from Northern Arabia and settling in the region betivet
the western boundaries of Babylonia and the highlands of Western Asia

were no other than the Hai who under their King Aram had spread their
conquests and their kingdom into Mesopotamia and even to the shores of
the Mediterranean.
Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when he includes
Northern Mesopotamia, together with the hountainous country of Ararat,
under the nante of Armenia, and in writing of the Armenian boats hat
brought merchandise to Babylon, he remarks that they were constructed in
Armenia, in the parts above Assy'ria.
Archaeological researches have laid the claim that the modern Armenians
are the descendants of the old Hittites ; the modern Armenian being supposed
