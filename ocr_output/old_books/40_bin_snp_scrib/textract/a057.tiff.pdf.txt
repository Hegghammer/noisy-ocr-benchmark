Church, but was also a fearless patriot- distinguished linguist, all elogaent preacher, and a
thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being hade for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the feared fanatical aprising of the Turks, threw prudenee to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history.
ating
At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrive from Constantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nercès, the Patriareh, their object lieing to the signatory Powers of
the Berlin Treaty to foree a guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.
Abdul IIhmid and his advisers were furious at this affront, and Monseigneur Nercès was
summoned to Ne Palace. It is said that when he received the summions lie simply smiled
and asked one of of his curates to read the Barial Service to him, as le did not expect to
return alive. Howeyer, he trent. No one has ever heard what passed between the Sultan
and himself at the interview; suffice it to say that he immediately summoned the Armenian
General Assembly and tendered his resignation. This was not accepted by the Assembly,
and, amidst enthusiastie cheers, lie was carried back to his apartments at the Patriarchate.
Meanwhil der reached him, signed by the Sultan, to recall the Armeuian
delegation from Berlin. This Monseigneur Varjabétian point-blank refused to do, and retired
to his private residence at Haskeuy, it village on the Golden Horn. The suceess of
gation, however, did not come up to his expectations. The Armenians, as it happened, could
not be heard, but they were so far successful as to have an article inserted in the treaty.
The Sultan and his advisers never forgave the Patriareli thris, though they could not
openly do anything to him on account of his enormous popalarity. Time passed on, and to
all appearance the incident was forgotten bitt not One sumier afternoon a most
cordial invitation was sent by a very higli dignitary of the Palace, requesting the Arehhishop
to dine with him informally. An invitation of this kind could not very well be refused, so
the Archbishop, accompanied only by a body-servant named Vartan, repaired to the Pasha's
honso The Pasha received him at the +loor and escorted the visitor with much ceremony and
extreme courtesy to a private apartment of the salamlik of his house (the men's quarters),
where dinmer was served. The geniality displayed by his host dispelled any fears that the
Arehbishop miglit have had as to his personal safety.
After dinner, as issual, coffee was served. Now, this serving of the entige is rather
a
ceremonial according to high Turkish etiquette, and it is not unusal for guests to bring their
own tchooboukdar (the servant who carries his master's pipe and pouch and also
the making of his coffee). The Archbishop tras presented with " tehoobouk (pfpe) fined

with due compliments to his host, and took a sip at lis coffec.
nst nt that moment the
heayy curtains over the doorway were thrown apart, revealing the ghastly pale face of his
servant Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, in a voice trembling with emotion, "Monseigueur,
I did not brew the coffee!
This was enough for the Archbishop ; he pretended to be startled and spilt the coffec, but

the poor fellow simply vanished. Monseigneur Varjabétian, after a short interval thanked
the Pasha for his generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily summoned. The Patriarchi took to his bed,
and lost all his hair through the effects of the poison. Then, one morning, when a servant
