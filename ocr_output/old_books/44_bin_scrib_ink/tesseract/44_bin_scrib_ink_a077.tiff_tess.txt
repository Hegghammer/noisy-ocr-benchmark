I will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and relate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
1796 after ruling over Armenia fifty-eight years. ny

He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his domjniofts,~and
grew to be so mighty in battle that the neighboftipg—pdtions called his
country Aramia and the people were called Ar&fnians, such names as
Armenia or enians being no doubt later corruptions.

The frst viktory of Aram was over Neuchf king of Media, whom he
took prisoker aid put to death, and made a | part of the country of the
defeated prince tributary to his own. The s ictory of Aram was over
Barsham king of Babylon, who isoner and put to death.

or assert, but in taking up link by link of whatever knowledge has been left
to us, there scems to be grounds for supposing that the ‘“,Aramzans ”’
designated by foreign writers as “a people of Semitic rac ngflage
religion, coming from Northern Arabia and settling in the (regi etw, /
the western boundaries of Babylonia and the Kc of Western Afia”
were no other than the Hai who under their Ki m had spread their =~
conquests and their kingdom into Mesopotamia even to the shores of
the Mediterranean.

Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when he includ
Northern Mesgpotamia, together withthe Motiirditfous country of Arprat,
under the nanfe~Of Armenia, and in writing of the Armenian boats Wat
