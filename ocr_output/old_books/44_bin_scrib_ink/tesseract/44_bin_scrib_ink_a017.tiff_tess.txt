As these sheets are going throu % gS news of fame
at Zeitoon. The Rev. F. W. Mach i y at Malrdsh,
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet, Amer tinople, ‘that
12,000 souls in and around Zeitoon are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran and water, and cooR®™ hey can
teven that. Rev. Mactlhtimadds; “The same stt eon all

of homelessness and_staryation will exceed 150,000. rue; and the
i
numbers are not exaggerated. Last year the people reap harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.
The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian vie phat had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered if 341
by armed Kurds, and the villagers are now reduced to extreme dist. Before /
the outbreak_the Armenian patriarchal vicar at MugihaJ repeated] p peated -

had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec-
tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It i
evident that the authorities at Constantinople-areunmahble to protect thrivin
Armenian va Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
