Care must be exercised to keep the strands from overlapping im-
properly at the corners. The strands should fit snugly where they
go over the rails. ‘To assure this, tap them sharply with a mallet
used over a block of soft wood. This may be done at frequent
| intervals or when several strands have been woven over each rail.

manner, for it builds up the seat and prevents its breaking down at
