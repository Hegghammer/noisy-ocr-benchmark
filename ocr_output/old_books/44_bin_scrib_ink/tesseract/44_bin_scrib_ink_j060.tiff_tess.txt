Primitive Methods.—Briefly the primitive process of convert-
ing the rattan, or raw material, into cane and reeds, or the finished
product, is this: The rattan stems are thoroly dried or seasoned,
and the nodules are pared off with a peculiar native knife. Then the

| rattan is sorted into sizes and selection made as to grade. The sort-

ing is based upon external color and diameter of the rattan. The

rattan is then immersed in water, and the stem is rubbed vigorously

with sand and cocoanut husks to remove dirt and foreign substances.

ts then bleached by means of sulphur fumes, either in the stem or
Presi peel and core have been prepared.

e metho! of preparing the peel and core is this: The peel, or
outer covering&is removed with a heayy knife; it is then stripped to
selected thickrises and widths by drawing it by hand thru two
knives set at rtired distances apart. This peel is commercially
called cane. core is then stripped into as many strands as
necessary, depe g upon the diameter of the cores required.
These are roun y drawing them thru a sheet -of tin or iron
perforated with of different diameters. The rounded cores
are called reeds.

Considerable r s still converted into the finished products
by hand processes these laborious stages. Machines have been
perfected which actically the entire work. Particularly have
the Germans this industry to a perfected state. Still in

Reed may %e procured in large or small hanks, in coils and in
bundles, with the cost determined by weight. Schools generally
will find it advantageous to buy it in small hanks, because of ease in
handling and for economic reasons. Round reeds are shown
