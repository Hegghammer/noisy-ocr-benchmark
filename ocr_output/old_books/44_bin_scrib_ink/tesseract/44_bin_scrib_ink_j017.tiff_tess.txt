CANING; THE SEVEN STEPS 18

open squares are thus formed over the area being caned. Unless
‘the cane is soaked it will prove rather difficult to pair the canes.
"Step 5. This step is the weaving of one set of diagonals. Start

Step 6. This step is identical with the preceding one. The ca"
are at right angles to thg first diagonals. In this step and the
preceding one note hyo san run into the corner holes.
This holds true in al/rectangular frames where a corner hole is
bored. It permits the strands to run in as straight a line as pos-_
sible. If it is necessary to turn abruptly to enter a hole it is obvious
that an error has been made by the weaver.

Step 7. Pull a cane of the same size as used in the other steps up
thru a hole, over the binder cane and down thru the same hole.
A loop is thus formed and the binder secured. Pull taut, then
