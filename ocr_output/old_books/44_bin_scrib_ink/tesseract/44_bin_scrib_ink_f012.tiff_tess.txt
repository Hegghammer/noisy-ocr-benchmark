viii PREFACE
. from Smith, who himself was prone to include - pe
the most extravagant myths in his pages, ca
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE TIstorY ee
THE ey Actions oF THE Most Famous
Hieuwkyuen. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the “truth” of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better. :
No one has ever reprinted those authors in
themertginnt extravagance, or their grossness.
It would be impossible ; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
| them, or even written an independent history of
the highwaymen. Tien we consider how astonish-
ingly popular th rances have ever been
Twit have had u Vall, and Turpin,
and their like this is not a little
surprising.
Perhaps abandoned because
of the di uperable difficulty (Y)
—of siftis ind because a ‘
chitling ~sense at thntad
to present the hi, e really was: a
fellow rarely heroie, ul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowar oveltist—touta
be likely to fin the frank ian for this dis-
service ; Ain do not think the h®torian who came
to the subject im this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
