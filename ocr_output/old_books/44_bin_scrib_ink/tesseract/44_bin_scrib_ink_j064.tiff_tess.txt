erence to others when available. rolls of thick inner bark are
allowed to dry for several weeks. en they are placed in water,
to remain until pliable. They are t¥§n split into strips of proper
thickness and width: Factories use W very simple motor driven
machine for making the strips, and an manual training shop can
devise some scheme for accomplishing th¥s work. These strips cut
in indefinite lengths must be made plian\ by a thoro soaking just
previous to use. In weaving they should he pressed close together
with the fingers or with the aid of a hammekh, as there is an appreci-’
able shrinkage especially in their width upoh drying. Such strips
are used mainly by bala ot rustic outdoor and porch furniture
for the weaving of tle backs, arms and seats of chairs, and have
at present no general use in school shops. Their use here should
be encouraged. If bought of the manufacturer these strips cost 40
cents per pound, dry. They are put up in coils, and are 34 in. wide
and 1/16 in. thick. They may be stripped into narrower widths
by means of a hand stripper, soon to be described.
