SEATS OF REEDS AND SPLINTS

The discussion of the weaving processes to fotOw iS \contirtadj} eer er
in_ the main, to stools or seats. Fig. 53 shows several stools different
C i design both in wood construction and in weaving. In two in-
: s it will be noted that weaving is done over_a separate frame,
one being inserted between the rails, the other fastened on top,
leaving a little projection. Reference is made to several possible
weaving designs and the use of yarious mediums and combinations.
The possible combinations aterials are merely suggestive of
possible other ones, and t ividual worker will find that many
designs of varying compl e worked out. An excellent
method for working out is that of using black and
white paper strips 34 in. in esign will show up very
clearly beeause of_the contrast and white. Experi-
menting with the weave on the s rather tedious and
unsatisfactory. The paper strips are an eans to an end.
The stool top illustrated in Fig. 54 empl kniple over-and-
under weave, utilizing flat reed. The worker o decide at

the outset on the character of weave to be used it be oh row
unusual design. In this instance the weaver runs over Mee and
under three strands, and[eh€ wrapping done in a series of three.
To begin the operatiop’tack an end of flat reed under a short rail
at a corner, then bring the strand out and over the rail, across the
frame opening to the opposite rail, under this rail, across under-
neath the frame opening to the bottom of the first rail. This com-
pletes the process once around. Repeat three times; then wrap the
strand around the two rails, without running it across the top.
Thus every fourth strand across the top is omitted. It is not
necessary to cut the strand; the wrapping is continuous. Repeat
