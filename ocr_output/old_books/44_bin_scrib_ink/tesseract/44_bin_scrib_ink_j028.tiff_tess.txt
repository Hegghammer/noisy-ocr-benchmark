with the addition of the leg rest shown in Fig. 2 for.a library or
living room. ‘The cane in each instance adds materially to the

pleasing groups well related to the wood mass. ‘The cane is natural,

Many modifications € standard weave in caning are in
vogue, but are more orfeds fads. A “rotary” weave is rather preva-
lent on certain types of furniture, as is what may be termed the
“‘spider-web” weave. These are mentioned merely to suggest that
caning is subject to variation. However, the standard weave, of
seven steps, will not be supplanted to any appreciable degree, for it
adapts itself to almost all types of furniture both decoratively and
structurally.
