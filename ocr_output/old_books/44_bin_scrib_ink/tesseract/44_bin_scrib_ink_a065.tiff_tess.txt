Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish nypire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this super-added eure 0
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, gseater ers and
depredators than the Turks, the regular cctpation Ge ves comprises
murder and robbery, and who have through weary tenturies unremittin ly
quartered t ves upon the industrious chrigaifn peasants, and lived on
the fruits df gery and toil. Indeed Hamidieh cavalry which
was establi expressly for the H nassacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matte on what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organ n now find for those habits in
which they were encou Fd to indulge by the Hamidian
r√©gime,
nder all s f better days can be forthcoming
no prospect ible, for that unhappy portion a
Armenia umstances keeps on the soil ol/the

rnors over the provinces in-
i her alternative,
allowing the use irrespective of creed or
Pasco would furnish ns of selfdefence against the raids
barbarities of the oppressors ; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christian_peasaat subject to Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his enemies, must remain one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Not the most fertile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the n siduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, Li othe
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of thdt tomf /
happiness, and security of life and property, Gi law of all civihzed -
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer ahd tHler of the soil.
