82 Seventh Generation.—Joseph I.

He possesses fine social qualities, and, since retiring from business, he °
occasionally amuses himself in hunting and fishing. His integrity,

industry and great business capacities, during the active part of his

life, rendered him a most valuable acquisition to the community in | ax
which he carried on his business, and the articles he mangfactur

were of sterling value to the farming interests of the country.

Mr. Horton, on sending me his photograph for an engraving,
accompanéctxwith the following very modest and unassuming sketch
of his life

Mr. Horton is not a public professor of Christianity, but is a gen-
tleman of correct moral deportment, and very temperate in his habits.
