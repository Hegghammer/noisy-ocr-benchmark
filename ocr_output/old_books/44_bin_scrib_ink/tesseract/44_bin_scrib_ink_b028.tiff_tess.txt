6 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
and carnivorous habits. They walk on their toes: yet not so much from that habitual stealthiness
of pace, by which they advance unperccived till within a spring of their prey ; as because it is also
the means of that celerity of motion which is necessary to the very existence of animals that can
fleed only on flesh.
Their claws are exceedingly powerful; and they are enabled to draw them up into sheaths
between their toes, so as to prevent their points from touching the ground; whence they are
d vetractile ; and those claws are, in consequence, always kept sharp, unworn, and ready for
pvice.

for the glare of day, cannot bear to encounter ret Yet these physical conforma-
tious are sometimes overcome by the rage of hunger; nd hence, in Mr. Epwin Lanpster’s

contending group, the Lion is represented as attacking the Tiger although it be day.
