The Weaving Process.—With the frame ready and rush in
proper condition the weaving may be started. Fig. 39 shows am-noon
isometric drawing on which corners are lettered and the rails
numbered in order. Fig. ows another drawing on which the
corners and rails are pfiilarly lettered and numbered, showing
