Character fades before it, or rather, is absorbed in it. It tells a story of the past as well as the
present, and is pregnant with a catastrophe not difficult to anticipate from the actions and
expressions of the parties engaged. A Fawn has been seized by a Leopard, who has been
despoiled of his prey by a more powerful T1cer. The Tiger in his turn becomes the victim of an
enraged Lion. a . 4

The expression of the wounded Leopard is that of painful suffering mingle iO ead.

class of quadrupeds that are exclusively flesh-caters. They jaws}are very completely armed ™
