CANING SUGGESTIONS 17

holes are bored and ‘utilized in the cane weaving. These are not
absolutely necessary; in fact caned areas on many pieces of period
and modern furniture do not utilize corner holes. In such instances
two diagonal strands are run in each hole on either side of the
| corner. A comparison of the areas, the one employing a corner

Irregular Areas.—Fig. 9 shows a close view of the back of the
chair illustrated in Fig. 7. This is a typical example of an irregular-
shaped area for caning. The principles of weaving remain the
