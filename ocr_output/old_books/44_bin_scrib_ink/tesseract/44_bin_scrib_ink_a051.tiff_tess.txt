On the field the ever victorious army of little Japan undermined Russia’s
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
defeated and ever retreating army of colossal Russia. At sea th cr
victorious Japanese Fleet succeeded in completely annihilating: Ussian
Fleet. It was war such as the world had never y@t c— The secret of
such astounding successes should be investigated, here I beg leave to
quote from rope of a series of articles in which I gave view to my opinions
during ies War. “Japan may be likened to the bundle of
faggots in ple firmly tied together ; one faggot of larger dimensions in
the centre, the sovereign round whom the whole nation clusters, and all,
ruler and people tied together by adamantine bands of patriotism.”

These remarks of mine were based on observations of actual facts. In
national unity Japan stands as an object lesson to the world; she furnishes
an exateple-witelmtie world needs to copy, and which a nation so peliside
forlorn as ourselves more than any other neeg
