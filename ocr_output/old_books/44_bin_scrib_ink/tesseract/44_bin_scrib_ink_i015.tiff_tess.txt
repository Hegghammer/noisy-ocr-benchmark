Remember that they know not what they do
Who strike-in-deadlyfear and ghastly hate;
Remember that somehow, and at some time,
Each crime exacts its human penalty.
| Remember that man’s congfience and man’s mind
Are agents of Thy p and Thy plan,
° . . ° V0 OOOO OO Oa
Which work within dlier revenge
P= any shrapne or sabre thrust.
Remember th enerations come
Upon who urden and the curse,
The angy atreds and past wr
The cr , the stru
R S vast hate;
ense of shame: O
ar, to us at peace,
message of the Christ.
