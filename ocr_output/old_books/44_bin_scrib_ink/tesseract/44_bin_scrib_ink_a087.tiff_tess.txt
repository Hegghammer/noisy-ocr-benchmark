Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have clung to their christian faith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure. RO

The cathedral of Etchmiatzin built by Gregory sPlsiert 6a it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part <fr other, until perhaps
little of the orf@inal building may be left, but it still claims to be the church
built by thd patrgn saint of Armenia. I shall here quote a passage from
“ Historical Shétch of the Armenian Church,” written by an Armenian
priest :

“Owing t mponian Patriarchate had at
times to be ~— towns of
Armenia, :
in 1114 to
extinct, a it
was na place/ as
the e é year 1441, it

| was ne Catholicus should
ret nas been preserved the
Biles and from cur holy Father,
of the foreign papers published in Japan,
Ss: .
an Church pronounced by experts to date from the second
the Christian era, has been discovered in a fair statg~pf greserva-
ion in the neighbourhood of Bash-Aparnah.” (V)

Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Psofessor 1&6 /
conducting might lead to throwing more light on ean history. -
