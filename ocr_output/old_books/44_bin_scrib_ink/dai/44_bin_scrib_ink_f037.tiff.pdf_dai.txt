as the town was named, i.e. the "hill-staple
or market, and his successors were often there?
The wool market was the most important at
Dunstable the monks long maintaining great
flocks of sheep on the adjacent downs.
The obbers became only a memory, but a
memory that never faded. It merely took on
another form, and in the course of time the name
of the town itself was twisted into an allusion
to them and to their leader. It needed the col-
usion of gross ignorance and wild legend to effect
much, but the thing was done; and for cen-
Dunstable was, and perhaps even now is,
loca aid to owe its name to "Dun's Stable,"
the chalk downs, pointed out as having
been
where "Dun," the entirely ima-
ginary
tlaws, stabled his horse.
If you do
the town seal to con-
vince the se yat,
as it does what is
said to be a horseshoe ( of Dun's horse!),
but is really intended for a or hasp.
The legendary Dun was nd of bogey to
the children of the neighbourho and in John-
son's
pages
is most bloodthi creature.
There we read that his first exploit as on the
highway to Bedford, where he met a was con full
of corn, going to market, drawn by a fine team
of horses. He accosted the waggoner, and in the
midst of conversation stabbed him to the heart
with a dagger. He buried the body, and drove the
waggon off to the town, where he sold the corn
and the waggon as well, and then disappeared!
