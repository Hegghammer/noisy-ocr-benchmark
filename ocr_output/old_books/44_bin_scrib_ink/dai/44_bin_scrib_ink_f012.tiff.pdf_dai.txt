from Smith, who himself was prone to include
the most extravagant myths in his pages,
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE LIVES AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAmous
HIGHWAYMEN. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the truth of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.
No one has ever reprinted those authors in
their original extravagance, or their grossness.
It would be impossible; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
them, or even written an independent history of
the highwaymen. I on we consider how astonish-
ingly popular the mances have ever been
which have had
Du Vall, and Turpin,
and their like
this is not a little
surprising.
Perhaps
abandoned because
of the di
superable difficulty
of sifting
and because of a
chilling sense
a thankless task
to present the high
e really was :
fellow rarely heroic,
oul-mouthed and
cruel, and often coward
novelist nould
be likely to the frank to ian for this dis-
service; and do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
