SEAT WEAVING
mm
Care must be exercised to keep the strands from overlapping im-
properly at the corners. The strands should fit snugly where they
go over the rails. To assure this, tap them sharply with a mallet
used over a block of soft wood. This may be done at frequent
intervals or when several strands have been woven over each rail.

manner, for it builds up the seat and prevents its breaking down at
the inner edges of the rails, and sagging with continued use. A
slightly curved hardwood stick about 12 in. long may be used to
advantage to do this work. Fig. 41 shows a sketch of such a stick.
It is 3/4 in. in diameter at one end and tapered to 1/2 in. by Â½ in. at
