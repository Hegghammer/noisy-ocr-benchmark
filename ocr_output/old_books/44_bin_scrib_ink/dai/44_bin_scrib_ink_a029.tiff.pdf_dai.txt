PART I.
THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN.
ating
Since the gatering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin 1878, and the signing of the sallamore famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr ll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel in history.
In the Guildhall erlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city of the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of repre ves of the powerful Governments of Europe,
but in the interests of H
there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 reaty of Berlin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood)
It was a curious irony
that alhough the taking of "the
terrible stronghold of Kars,'
adm to be one of the greatest
and most difficult military expl
and the crowning success
of the Russian arms in Asiatic
ve been accomplished by
an Armenian General; that alt
Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest and
fought conquered and
died, yet by these successes not on
lioration attained of the
hard fate of their unhappy nation und
le, but that fate, hard
before, was made a hundredfold and even
old harder.
