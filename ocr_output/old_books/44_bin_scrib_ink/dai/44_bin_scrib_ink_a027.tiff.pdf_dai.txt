was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples which with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engage in
commerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase the le of
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few among them justly started an agitation these our noble
and industrious brethren were being massacred. What a ferite scene! When we
left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our menian compatriots being
removed in manure carts; legs and as were hanging down outside. This bloody scene will
ever remain impressed on my mind.
"This shocking crime of Yildi med a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a cursed absolutism o the last moment, grew wider. Even during the
past nine months of the Constitutio pite of the brotherly feelings which had been shown,
the awful events in Adana took pla the souls of all true Osmanlis melted into tears.
Up to the present time the deep so sed by this event has not disappeared, because this
bloody wound in our social body e ly be cured. While we fill our stomachs with
choice morsels, while we rest selfis
comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans, Widows hungry, naked, a

We are convineed that the gover

Hereafter we must work re them that the era of massacres has passed, and with all our

them is also very heavy, use our Armenian countrymen live among wandering tribes.
We must all assist the government and point out its obligation. It must be declared in
public and periodically that the one of the most important duties of the Ottoman nation is to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and property of the
Armenians as well, since these are their sacred rights. Let investigations be made and let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim.”
This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare disclose
his identity; and the account given by an authority like Mr. James Bryce
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as "les Massacres occasionnès par les aventuriers Arméniens.”
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
