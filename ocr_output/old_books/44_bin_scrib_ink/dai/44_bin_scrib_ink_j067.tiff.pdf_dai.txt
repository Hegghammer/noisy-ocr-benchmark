CHAPTER VII
SEATS OF REEDS AND SPLINTS
The discussion of the weaving processes to follows confined un
in the main, to stools or seats. Fig. 53 shows several stools different
design both in wood construction and in weaving. In two in-
stances it will be noted that weaving is dor over a separate frame,
one being inserted between the rails, the other fastened on top,
leaving a little projection. Reference is made to several possible
weaving designs and the use of various mediums and combinations.
The possible combinationsmaterials are merely suggestive of
possible other ones, and th dividual worker will find that many
designs of varying comple
be worked out. An excellent
method for working out
is that of using black and
white paper strips Â½ in. in
design will show up very
clearly because of the contrast
and white. Experi-
menting with the weave on the sea
rather tedious and
unsatisfactory. The paper strips are an
means to an end.
The stool top illustrated in Fig. 54 emplo *mple over-and-
under weave, utilizing flat reed. The worker to decide at
the outset on the character of weave to be used us it be
on
unusual design. In this instance the weaver runs over three and
under three strands, and the wrapping done in a series of three.
To begin the operation tack an end of flat reed under a short rail
at a corner, then bring the strand out and over the rail, across the
frame opening to the opposite rail, under this rail, across under-
neath the frame opening to the bottom of the first rail. This com-
pletes the process once around. Repeat three times; then wrap
the
strand around the two rails, without running it across the top.
Thus every fourth strand across the top is omitted. It is not
necessary to cut the strand; the wrapping is continuous. Repeat
