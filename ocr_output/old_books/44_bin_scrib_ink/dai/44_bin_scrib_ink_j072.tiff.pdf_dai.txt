wrapped completely around the rails, for otherwise it would prove
practically impossible to weave the area because of the thickness
of the reed. A winding reed as shown in Fig. 49 or binder cane
could be run continuously, inasmuch as either is retively thin.
Weaving with two kinds of reed will produce ana of pleasing

flat reed. The diagonal
weave is used running
non center, and it forms a
diamond pattern or design wrapping on the long rails,
skipping every other strand on p as indicated. To weave this
pattern it is necessary to locate e center of the short rails and
the center strand of those running across the frame. In this instance
the strands are even in number, so the pattern does not begin at
the actual center, but a little to the right or left as the case may be.
Beginning at the center, count by twos, over, under and over, under
and so on to determine the number of strands to go over or under
