wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus describes a company of
ladies. They were, says he, "clothed all alike, in kirtles with rich capes
or mantles parti-coloured, white, and blue, embroidered all over with
various devices." Their bodies are described as being ong and small,
and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as the gh each of them
had been a queen.
We find that the tight-laced

court of the Lady Triamore "had mantles en-coloured velvet,
handsomely bordered with gold, and lined

1361, influence of the corset on the costume of that period.
The another poem, said to be more ancient than even Launfal,
ven, no doubt, served to give a tone and direction to the fashions of
times following after. Here we find a beautiful lady described as
wearing a splendid girdle of beaten gold, embellished with rubies and
emeralds, about her middle small.
Gower, too, when describing a lover who is in the act of admiring
his mistress, thus writes :-
“He seeth hir shape forthwith, all
