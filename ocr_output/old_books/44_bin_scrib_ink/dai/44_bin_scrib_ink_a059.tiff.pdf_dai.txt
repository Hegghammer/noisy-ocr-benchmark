A book has been written a
Niku Dan
translated into English, reads,
little book, a
narrative of the siege of Port Ar
ugh the length
and breadth of the empire, four
it into the best
known of languages; and its young
or in the siege,
was summoned to the presence of
ed and praised.
The book is a graphic narrative of the
history, wherein
is vividly portrayed the deadly strugg
it contains as an
acknowledgement of its merit, a page on
orded the Field
Marshal's appreciation, and another page bearin
anding General's -
commendation.
In simple narrative the author carries the
rough appalling
scenes of horror, and as we read we are made to the slaughter of
the enemy's machine guns, of their ground-mines, c-wire entangle-
ments, and exploding shells; we are made to hear the r of the artillery
fire dealing death and destruction, and there rises before the mental vision
of the fierce hand to hand conflict, and the dead and dy lying thickly in
the dark ravine.
"For hill and battle plain,
With dying men and slain,
Grew mountain heights of pain
And mine is boundless woe."
The grim warrior who stormed and took the most impregnable fortress
in the world gives expression to his feelings on his own great achievement,
in saddest words,
And mine is boundless woe,"
For the grim warrior's heart is cleft in twain for the human bullets that
under his command hurled themselves to their death.
