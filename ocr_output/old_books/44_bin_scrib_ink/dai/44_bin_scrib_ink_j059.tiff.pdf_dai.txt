CHAPTER VI
REED AND SPLint Weaving
Reeds which are used extensively for basket-making and weavingn
in general are procured from the species of palm described in Chap-
ter I. These reeds should not be confused with the term reed
applied to several distinct species of large water loving grasses
Such reeds are usually designated under the name of grasses. There
are a thousand species of palm distributed over the tropic regions
of the entire world, but only a few are native in the nited States,
and these are of no distinct commercial value de rattan or cane

market sold under the names of China reed and German reed. The
former is inferior in quality and the latter is superior, being strong,

equal the German product. The problem, however, is one of gath-
ering and marketing the product. The government has made a
partial survey of the rattan supply, and this justifies the belief that
the Islands will eventually compete with the world market.
