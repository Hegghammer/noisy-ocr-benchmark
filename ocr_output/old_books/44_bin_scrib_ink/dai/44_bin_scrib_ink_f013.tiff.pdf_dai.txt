Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific high
torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and exalted the villains, for whom of old no
mud was too thick and slab. Beliefs are being
assailed on every
side. To abolish the traditional
of Claude Du Vall or the considerate
could, therefore, be
tempted
not be-
lieve,
been
worth
inal
trials,
alch
7sources, decorously stripped
ge.
For really, wh√®re much that
may be fully proved, and where
turns out not rarely to be false, 'tis your on,
To continue the story of the highwaymen fro
Smith and Johnson down to the approaching end
of all such things in the beginning of the nine-
teenth century, is like taking up and concluding
a half-told tale. But it was worth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpin has
always made, has it been found really necessary
to seriously comto seriously 
consider and re-state the career of
that much-overrated scoundrel, and to put him
in his proper place: a very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
