HALF-HOURS WITH THE HIGHWAYMEN

later at the Old Bailey, he never showed to
advantage, Sixteen String Jack excepted, with
his pea-green coat and his bouquet, as big as a
cabbage. And as the eighteenth century closed
and gave pla
nineteenth, the mounted
highwayman grad lisappeared, and the foot-
pad, a miserable,
cowardly figure, for
whom no one ever ha od word, is seen in
his dark lurk, in the
litch, not often
courageous enough to
e, and generally
found in couples, read
with the suffo-
cating pitch-plasters that
d the wayfarers
of that time.
The footpad never ha e slightest inkling
of romance, and was al brutal whether he
clapped that pitch-plaste ver your mouth, or
terrified you, or finished his examination of
your pockets by knocking u down and jumping
on your body. A far
y, indeed, from the
generous days of Captain Hind, or Claude Du
Vall.
No one would ever contemplate a work on
"Half-Hours with the Foot ads."
It would be
to introduce the reader into the very worst of
society, and the least entertaining; and so we
come by degrees to the present era of the house-
breakers and the newspaper records, where you
may seek romance if you will.
The history of the highwaymen is a lengthy
emergence from ancient fables and marvellous
rustic folklore, to more settled records. It is not
peculiar in that gradual development, Such is
V.
