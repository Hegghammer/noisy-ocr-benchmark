Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire,
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, greater marauders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation of whose lives comprises
murder and robbery, and who have through weary centuries unremittingly
quartered themselves upon the industrious christen peasants, and lived on
the fruits of their labour and toil. Indeed e Hamidiel cavalry which
was established expressly for the Har massacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter
on what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organi
an now find for those habits in
which they were
ed to indulge by the Hamidian
régime.
Under all su
of better days can be forthcoming
no prospect
sible, for that unhappy portion of the
Armenian
cumstances keeps on the soil of the
father
over the provinces in-
evils, or the other alternative,
allowing the use
irrespective of creed or
nationality, would furnish means of self-defence against the raids
and barbarities of the oppressors; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christian peasant subject to Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his enemies, must remain one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Not the most fertile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the most assiduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, can bring to the
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
happiness, and security of life and property, which the law of all civilized
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer and title of the soil.
