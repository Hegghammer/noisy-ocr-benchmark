IN ASIA MINOR.
The trouble beg
engthened and augmented by soldiers
fell in overwhelming
tians. The Armenian population of
Antioch and vicinity were
the Armenian villages in the
Alexandretta district destroyed we
Hadjim, Kessab and the neigh-
bouring villages were burned. The Arme
Tarsus was rumed and ill-omened
Marash stained again with the blood of thousands
s. Zeitoon was desolated. The
entire population of Kirikon between Aleppo and A tta were massacred to the last
habe. The mob and the soldiers burned what they could norry away, so that the material
loss has been enormous. In place of the former abundance and thriving industries there are
instead desolated provinces and the charred and blackened remains of pillaged and ruined
homes, and the residue of those who escaped massacre are reduced to homelessness and
starvation.
