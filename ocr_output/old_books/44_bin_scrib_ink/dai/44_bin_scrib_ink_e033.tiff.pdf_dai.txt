elaborately-ornamented waistbelts in general use, and by their arrange-
ment it will be seen that they were so worn as to show the waist off to
the best advantage. The accompanying illustrations represent Egyptian
ladies of distinction. The dress in the first, it will be observed, is worn
long. A sort of transparent mantle covers and gives an appearance
of width to the shoulders, whilst a coloured sash, after binding the
waist, is knotted in front, and the ends allowed to fall freely over the
front of the dress, much as we have seen it worn in our own time; and
it is most remarkable that, although there is no evidence to show the use
of crinoline by the ladies of old Egypt, the lower border of the skirt, in
some instances, appears distended as in the prior illustration; whilst in
others, as hown in the second engraving, the dress is made to fit the
lower portion of the figure closely, barely affording scope for the movement
of the legs i alking. How often these arrangements of dress have
been in turn ed and discarded will be seen as our work proceeds.
