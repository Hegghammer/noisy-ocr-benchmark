THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.

Investigation proves to us that the taste for slender waists prevailed
even more in the Eastern nations than in those of Europe, and we find
that other mans besides that of compression have been extensively
taken advantage of. Humboldt, in his personal narrative, describes the
women of Java and informs us that the reddish clay called “ampo” is
eaten by them in or that they may become slim, want of plumpness

hands, and that no pains are spared in the formation of their figures

of the far-famed beauties of Circassia? The women wear a corset made of
