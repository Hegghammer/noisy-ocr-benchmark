charge lies against them of being insufficient to those purposes of taste and information
which are the ends of Art. Even those after TITIAN and after RUBENS (the latter of whom has
perhaps painted a greater number than
any
other the old masters) are far more deficient in
form, character, and expression, than is generally supposed, or than will be easily believed, by
those who have not actually compared them with the Lions, Leopards, and Tigers of Nature.
They have been taken too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
-Nor is this intended to impugn the merits, as historical or poetical painters, of those distinguished
Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that as a painter of allegory, RUBENS
