No one doubts that a great forward movement is reaching its culminat-
ing point in the destiny of Asia. The West has learnt its all of religion (the

Turks decidedly mean well, and they are animated frith a sincere desire to
ensure peace and security of life and property for the heterogeneous peoples
under the Turkish sway, but they themselv

The Christian Arme in Turkey live in the midst of the followers
a hostile religion, with no power or force behind them which makes for
protection. Who does not know that the great numerical preponderance of
Hinduism keeps the balance of power in India, and restrains bloody religious
hostilities; and when we review the whole religious history of Christian
Europe, and that terribly long roll of crimes committed in the name of Him
who expounded His religion with the parable of the Good Samaritan, and
the precept of loving one's neighbour as one's self, we cannot feel surprise
the fanatical outbursts of the followers of Mahommed, the founder
religion whose doctrines certainly fall short of the humane principles
inculcated by the Founder of Christianity. If authentic historical facts prove
to us that horrible and atrocious cruelties have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other religionists, but on fellow Christians of different
denominations, how then can we expect better things from the Turk unless
some power or force restrain him?
Christianity has now partly emancipated herself from the ferocities
which darkened and poured the red stream of blood on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at large, religion is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite.
