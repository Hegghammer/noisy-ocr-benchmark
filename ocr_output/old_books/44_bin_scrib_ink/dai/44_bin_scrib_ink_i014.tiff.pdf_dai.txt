THE ZONE
Avert Thy gaze, O God, close tight Thine eyes!
Glance down no longer on the ocean foam,
Lest Thou behold such horrors as can tur
Men's burning hearts to ice, and chill the
Keep Thine heart warm and full of cha
That Thou mayst yet be able to forg
And pity feel for those who know
To pause in deeds of ruthless
Z
Restrain Thy wrath, and keep
check;
Smite not, nor fiercely thrust without the pale
Those who can dare to strew the ocean waste
With fellow creatures, innocent of wrong.
O
Forget the studied purpose to destroy;
The launching of the missile through the deep;
The shattered hull; the crushed and bleeding forms;
The seething swirl of wreckage, women, men.
