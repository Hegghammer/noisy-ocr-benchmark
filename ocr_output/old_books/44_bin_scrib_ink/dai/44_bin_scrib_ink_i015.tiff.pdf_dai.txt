Remember that they know not what they do
Who strike in deadly fear and ghastly hate;
Remember that somehow, and at some time,
Each crime exacts its human penalty.
Remember that man's conscience and man's mind
Are agents of Thy purpose and Thy plan,
Which work within a dlier revenge
Than any shrapnel or sabre thrust.

Remember the
Upon whom
The angu
generations come
burden and the curse,
hatreds and past wrong
, the struggle
The cry
Re

sense of shame:
war, to us at peace,
e message of the Christ.
