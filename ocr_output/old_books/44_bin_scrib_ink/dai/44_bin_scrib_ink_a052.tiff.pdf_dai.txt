"A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel
weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because
they were not.

of the twentieth century, the horrors of the darkest ages in human history
have lain at her doors, and towards these horrors Europe has kept up the
role of an extenuatingly disclaiming, a mildly rebuking sweetly frowning,
smilingly denouncing, Disapprover.
Half a million Armenians annihilated by organized massacres of the
most ferocious and hideous natures, and perhaps a corresponding number
