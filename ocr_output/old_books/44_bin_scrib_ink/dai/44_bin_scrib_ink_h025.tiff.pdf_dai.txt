order of births.
In many of the early families
order of
births cannot be ascertained; but it has been appro as nearly
as possible. The lineage is given in connection with
member
of the family. The Roman numerals indicate the orde births.
The sons and daughters of the old Puritan, Barnabas, constitute the
second generation, but they are spoken by way of eminence as Joseph
I., Hannah I., &c. The book contains much repetition, but none
too much to make it plain and easy to study.
This little book contains the chronicles of only about one-half of
the Horton families looked up. Those whose genealogical data are
given only in a small part, and those whose correct lineage has not
been satisfactorily ascertained, are not included in this book.
