like a round bow, a great brown eye revealed the inward spirit's intelligence and zeal un-
quenched. On his head was a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.
Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest men-Mitch
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or " They-Begotten
is Descended." From the window of a neighboring room he
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now al cut close and buried
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling snow and hurricane that
cone of Arary. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Delue
shore of that lake eighty-seven years ago, Khrimian was born. In 1820

But the cup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiless slaughter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Klimian found
himself summoned to plead his people's cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Europe
beforehand, urging them to create an autonomous neutral state for Armenia, as they had
done with success for the Lebanon. In London he became acquainted with Gladstone; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey's definite reforms. It is neculess to say that trone of these promises and
