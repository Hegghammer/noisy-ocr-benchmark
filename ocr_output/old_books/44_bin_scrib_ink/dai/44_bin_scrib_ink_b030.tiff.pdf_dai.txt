CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

the position of the head. In all gramnivorous animals, the skin of the head is closely attached to
the skull, and capable only of very limited motion: the eye is almost uniformly mild, and the lips
unmoved by passion.
"It is in carnivorous animals, with whose habits and manner of life, ferocity is instinctively
connected, as the great means of their subsistence, that rage is distinguished by the most
remarkable strength of expression. The eye-ball is terrible, and the retraction of the flesh of the
lips indicates the most savage fury. But the first, is merely the exerted attention of the animal;
and the other a preparatory exposure of the canine teeth. The great animals of prey-the Lion
and the Tiger-are quite incapable of any other expression of feature, than this particular display
of ferociousness. When they fawn upon their keeper, there is no motion in their features that
indicates affection."
In this assertion, that the countenances of the great animals of prey are incapable of any
other than ferocious expression, we do not quite coincide
they fawn upon their keeper, we think that indications of affection are exhibited; and find
ourselves ready to ask what else than kind(expression is that "licking of the hand" which our
author has before mentioned. however, we should grant that they may not be capable of
affectionate expression toward their keeper, we can scarcely doubt that-toward their young-if
ould observe them in their wild state, and in their moments of playful intercourse and

indic tion, as well as fear, enquiry, surprise, gratitude, pleasurable wantonness, and some
other se
