Cane.-Cane is the name applied to a great number of plants
which possess long, stender, reedlike stems. The name should apply
only to a class of palms called rattans. These plants are found
thruout the Indian Archipelago, China, India, Ceylon, and the
Malay Peninsula. They grow in dense, dark forests and form a
matted undergrowth which makes passage difficult or impossible.
These palms are trailing in tendency, yet frequently grow to treen
height. They then fall over and lie on the ground. The stem is
covered with beautiful green foliage, grows to a length of 100 to
300 ft., and rarely exceeds in. in diameter. The stems are cut
into lengths of 10 to 20 ft. for export. The outer bark is stripped
into widths varying from 1/16 to 3/16 in. These strips are put
into hanks of 1,000 lineal feet each. The cane is then ready for
the cane weaver. A hank of cane costs from 60 cents to $1. The
width of the cane and its quality determines the price per hank.
