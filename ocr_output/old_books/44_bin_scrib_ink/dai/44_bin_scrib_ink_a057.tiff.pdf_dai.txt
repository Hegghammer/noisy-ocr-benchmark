and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the feared fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history.
At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nercès, the Patriarch, their object heing to request the signatory Powers of
the Berlin Treaty to force a guarantee from the Turkish
at to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.
Abdul Hamid and his advisers

summoned to the Palace. It is safe

and himself at the interview; suffice it to

by the Assembly,
and, amidst enthusiastic cheers, he was carried back

Meanwhile promptery order reached him, signed by
the Armenian
delegation from Berlin. This Monseigneur Varjabétian por

to his private residence at Haskeuy, a village on the Golden
ccess of the dele-
gation, however, did not come up to his expectations. The A

The Sultan and his advisers never forgave the Patriarch
they could not
openly do anything to him on account of his enormous popularit

cordial invitation was sent by a very high dignitary of the Palace,
he Archbishop
to dine with him informally. An invitation of this kind could no
be refused, so

heavy curtains over the doorway were thrown apart, revealing the ghastly pa

servant Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, in a voice trembling with emotion, seigneur,
I did not brew the coffee!"
This was enough for the Archbishop; he pretended to be startled and spilt the ffee, but
alas! he had already drunk a small quantity of it. Meanwhile a seuille was going behind
the portière, where is poor servant Vartan was paying the penalty of his devotion to his
master. Concerning Vartan's whereabouts or his ultimate end nothing was ever made puble

the Pusha for his generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
