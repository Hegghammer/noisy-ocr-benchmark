even heard that the leaders and participators of the last massacres have
been punished as they deserved; and what is the reason they are left un-

In conclusion, I will ask, eaders to compare one point of difference
between the two races, the essor and the oppressed. Thousands upon
thousands of Armenian men, thousands upon thousands of Armenian
children, have been houd to death, or savagely, ferociously, horribly and
loathsomely maltreated the Turk, and yet in all the agonizing years when
Massacre has succeed upon Massacre, has there been one known case or
one single instance na Turkish weman or child maltreated by Armenians?
The last masacres though especially organized from the Palace at
Constantinople were officially announced to originate from an affray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed one of the three
given equal numbers and arms, the Armenian is always a match for the
Turk, but alas for him that unequal numbers and want of arms have always
made him the fun of his oppressor.
Ahmed Riza Bey in the first part (Ses Causes) of his book "La Crise de
L'Orient published in Paris in 1907 holds a brief for his nation which
through its own fallacious arguments falls to the ground. I will quote one
passage as an example.
