an opposite theory, in which instinctive agency is rejected, and the appearances are explained from
a consideration of the necessities and voluntary exertions of the animal. With regard to the
observer, it has been asserted, that it is by experience alone that he distinguishes the signs of the
passions; that we learn, while infants, to consider smiles as expressions of kindness, because they
are accompanied by acts of beneficence and by endearments; and frowns as the contrary, because
we find them followed by blows; that the expression of anger in a brute, is only that which has
been observed to precede his biting; and that of fondness, his fawning and licking of the hand.

“The gramnivorous animals, which seek their subsistence, not by preying upon others, or by
the ferocity, contest, and victory which supply the carnivorous with food, have in their features no
strong expression of rage. Their expression is chiefly confined indeed to the effect produced on the
general system. Thus the inflamed eye and the breathing nostrils of the Bull, are induced only
by the general excitement. His only proper expression of rage, is in the position of the head,
