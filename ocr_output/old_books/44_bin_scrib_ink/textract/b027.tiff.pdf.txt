No. VI.
IN this GROUP by MR. EDWIN LANDSEER there is much of violent alimal Expression, and
Character fades before it, or rather, is absorbed in it. It tells a story of the past as well as the
present, and is pregnant with a catastrophe not difficult to anticipate from the actions and
expressions of the parties engaged. A FAWN has been seized by a LEOPARD, who has been
despoiled of his prey by a more powerful TIGER. The Tiger in his turn becomes the victim of an
enraged LION.
The expression of the wounded Leopard is that of painful suffering mingled
read.
Together, they amount to agony. He shrieks while he submits. The Tiger is
and
resisting, though astounded with the power and suddenness of the Lion's attack

page, (No. I.) They form a tribe that is especially and properly Carnirorous, being the
class of quadrupeds that are exclusively flesh-caters. Their jaws are very completely armed
this purpose; their canine teeth being very long and angular, with the edgee of the angles turned
toward the inside of their mouths; so that when meanimal has caused them to meet or cross each
