far
Remember that they know not what they do
Who strikorin-deadly tear and ghastly hate;
Remember that somehow, and at some time,
Each crime exacts its human penalty.
Remember that man's cons cience and man's mind
Are agents of Thy purp C and Thy plan,
Which work within a
dlier revenge
Than any shrapnel
or sabre thrust.
Remember tha
generations come
Upon whom
burden and the curse,
The angu
hatreds and past wropg
The cry
the struggle
Re
ns vast hate;
sense of shame:
war, to us at peace,
message of the Christ.
