than over a half a century and lastly Jonathan G. Horton, about a
half a century ; making in all two hundred and thirteen years at the
death of Jonathan G. Horton, 3 July, 1873. These six generations
all living and dying in the old mansion ! Could those old whis re-
o
echo all the words ever spoken here, and exhibit anew all the scenes
ever witnesged there-the book a taining such a record would vastly
exceed in volume the size of the astle. It would bring to light
much that in darkness, and
forever remain hidden from
the generations of the living.
At the death of Jonathan G. Hd
d homestead became,
by will, the property of the Rev. M
f Brooklyn, N. Y.,
who was the adopted daughter of
Morton, he never
having hat on the 3d d
the old homestead
went out of the Horton name.
Mrs. Williams proposes to sell it,
ome of the Hortons do
not buy it, it will indicate a lack of de
spect for the old castle,
if not for the Horton name. It shd
bought back into the
Horton name, suitably repaired and pi
d for the wonder and
admiration of generations
Horton, the short, thick man, and Stuart
erry, are the two men
seen in the engraving, in front of the old h
Mr. Stuart T. Terry, of Southold, L. I., ha
ndly
copied
and
for-
warded to me, many interesting facts from the ew Haven Colonial
Records, some of which are here inserted :
