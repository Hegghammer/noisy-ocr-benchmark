THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.

Investigation proves to us that the taste for slender waists prevailed
even more in the Eastern nations than in those of Europe, and we find
that other mians besides that of compression have been extensively
taken adyartage of. Humboldt, in his personal narrative, describes the
women ON Java, an d informs us that the reddish clay called "ampo" is
eaten by them in or ar that they may become slim, want of plumpness
being a kind of bea ty in that country. Though the use of this
earth is fatal to heald those desirous of profiting by its reducing
qualities persevere in its sumption. Loss of appetite and inability to
partake of more than mo ainute portions of food are not slow in
bringing the wished-for COF

Pacific and Indian Ocean we have but to tra el to e grass-clad Tailà
of Crim Tartary and the rock-crowned fastnesse. of Cr. issia, to see the
same tastes prevailing, and even more potent means HIT force for the

obtainment of a taper form. Any remarks from usyas to the beauty of
the ladies of Circassia would be needless, their claim to that enviable
endowment being too well established to call for confirmation at our
hands, and that no pains are spared in the formation of their figures
will be best seen by a quotation from a recent traveller who writes on
the subject :
"Wha would' (he says) " our ladies think of this fashion on the part
d
of the far-famed beauties of Circassia ? The women wear a corset made of
'morocco," and furnished with two plates of wood placed on the chest,
