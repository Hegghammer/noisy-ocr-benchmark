Primitive Methods.-Brieñy the primitive process of convert-
ing the rattan, or raw material, into cane and reeds, or the finished
product, is this: The rattan stems are thoroly dried or seasoned,
and the nodules are pared off with a peculiar native knife. Then the
rattan is sorted into sizes and selection made as to grade. The sort-
ing is based upon external color and diameter of the rattan. The
rattan is then immersed in water, and the stem is rubbed vigorously
with sand and cocoanut husks to remove dirt and foreign substances.
Itzis then bleached by means of sulphur fumes, either in the stem or
after the peel and core have been prepared.
The method of preparing the peel and core is this The peel, or
outer covering is removed with a heavy knife; it is then stripped to
selected thickn ses and widths by drawing it by hand thru two
knives set at r uired distances apart. This peel is commercially
called cane.

core is then stripped into as many strands as
necessary, depel
g upon the diameter of the cores required.
These are rount
by drawing them thru a sheet of tin or iron
perforated with
of different diameters. The rounded cores
are called reeds.
Considerable r.
Is still converted into the finished products
by hand processes
these laborious stages. Machines have been
perfected which

the Germans

various sections
China, and the Philippines hand working
of rattan is a thi
industry seemingly peculiarly
adapted to the n

raw material va

natives do not

Reed may be procured in large or small hanks, in coils and in
bundles, with the cost determined by weight. Schools generally
will find it advantageous to buy it in small hanks, because of ease in
handling and for economic reasons. Round reeds are shown
three-fourths size in Fig. 49, from No. o to and including No. 7,
also winding, half-round and flat reeds. Winding reed is thin and
