CHAPTER V
RUSH SEATING
Rush seating, employing either genuine rush or substitutes, may
be done to good advantage and with excellent results in manual
traning shops. No equipment is needed to maintain such work.
The addition of a woven seat to a chair or stool constructed in the
shops will necessarily employ a new, interesting medium in con-
junction with woodwork; and materially increase the pupils' knowl-
edge of materials and possible combinations. And, as with caning,
the resultant interest in the work at hand more than justifies its
introduction in manual trainig shops. Rush seating employs a very
simple weave. Different materials

made to 4000 B. G. A small amount of rush still clings to
the seat frame. The relative date of the construction and weaving
of the chair seat would indicate that rush seating is by no means a
modern art, altho at present rush is extensively employed in fur-
niture.
The use of rush in England dates no earlier than I720. Several
types of chairs were made there between that date and 1870. In
France rush was used extensively in the seating of furniture of
Normandy and Brittany about 1750. Flanders produced rush
