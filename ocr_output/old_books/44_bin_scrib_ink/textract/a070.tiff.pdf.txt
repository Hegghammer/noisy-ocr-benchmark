60
victims in thy Yildiz Kiosk, found its way to thy treacherous heart. No
poisoned cup of coffee like the countless cups brewed in thy palaces trickled
down thy throat to end thy vampire existence.
Thou hast lived ! Protected from the Nemesis of thy crimes by
jealousies and rivalries of great powers which thou artfully plaved one against
another ; by the combined forces of religion and plupder which thou cunningly
wielded into one. Even so thou livest ! Peerless living example in the
civilized twentieth century of the Triumph of Crime.
L'AVENIR.
In the foregoing pages I have directed my
Fts to sketch out
what the Powers of Europe have done in the
low their actions
have reflected on my unfortunate race.
It is considered good policy now by
European writers
to ascribe all the horrors of the Arm
Iamid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as
herable as he was
implacable, in short as
a
o swept everything
before him to the cou
II.
The reason for
this is not difficult to pero
Iw the part Europe
has played in the tragedy,
becomes necessary
also to present Turkey to the wor
se (from whence the
tyrant once removed) peopled d
saints and rels ; so we have also
many roseate colored word pict
of Constitutional Turkey.
The murders, deportations
imprisonments of the Torkish revolu-
tionaries, or more correctly
mers, were undoubtedly the sole work of
Abdul Hamid and his palace
fue, but Abdul and his minions could not
have carried out that hell work of wholesare extermination of the
Armenians without the petration and participation of the Turkish
people. It is true the 11/ ssacres were originated and organized in the
Palace, the Palace clique firred up religious fanaticism and race hatred, but
the co-operation of the was necessaty. and the people co-operated
in order to plunder and Venrich themiselves with the worldly goods that the
Armenians always knew how to acquire by their own industry and toil the
appeal to their marauding and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
