magistrate, and several Times a member of the General Court at New
Haven and Harford built the first framed dwelling-house ever
erected on the east of Long Island, and that house is still (1875)
standing and occupied. It is a shingle-house, that is, shingles are
used for weather-boards, and the sides have never been reshingled,
and the roof but once, according to the statement of Jonathan Gold=
smith Horton, the last Horton occupant of the old house.
