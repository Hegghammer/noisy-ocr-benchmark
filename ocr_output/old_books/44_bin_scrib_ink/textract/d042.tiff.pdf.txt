THE CHILD OF THE MOAT
They were almost too excited to sleep and Aline, as
her custom was, when she lay awake, amused herself
by building castles in the air. Sometimes she would
imagine herself as a great lady, sought after by all the
noble knights of the land, but holding herself aloof with
reserved dignity until one, by some deed of unusual
distinction, should win her favour. As a rule, however,
this seemed rather a dull part to play, though there was
something naturally queenly in her nature, and she
would therefore prefer something more active. She
would take the old Scots romance of Burd Helen, or
Burd Aline, as her own inspiration, and follow her
knight in the disguise of a page over mountain aild
torrent and through every hardship This better suited
the romantic self-sacrifice of her Isual moods and, by
its imaginary deeds of herois ministered just as much
to her sense of exaltation fo-night had opened vistas
of new suggestion land
e pictured her knight and her-
self fleeing before
of enemies and miraculously
disappearing at t
al moment into the secret room.
But at last she Tell
a sound slumber and did not
wake till it was near
time for the morning meal.
