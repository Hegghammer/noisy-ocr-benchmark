At the vei
civilisation there are distinct evidences of the
use of conti
reduction and formation of the female figure.
Researches an
Polenqui, one of the mysterious forest cities
of Sonth Amer
lost in remote antiquity, have brought
to light most sil
the existence of a now forgotten
race. Amongst tl

AChion to a profusion of massive
ornaments, wears a
elaborate waist-bandage, which,
by a system of circular
Kolding and looping, confines the
waist from just below t.
hips as firmly and (compactly as
the most unyielding corset

Eastern Archipelago, it was

of the ingepious a system of cutting and fitting so as more perfectly to
adapt them to the figure of the wearer. The modes of fastening, as
we shall see, have been various, from the simple sewing together with
the lace to the costly buckle and jewelled loop and stud.
