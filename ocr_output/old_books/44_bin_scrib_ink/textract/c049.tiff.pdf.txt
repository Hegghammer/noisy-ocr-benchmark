THE STORY OF EEAN THE FISHERMAN'S SON
when we were far outside the palace my master
said to me :
"It will come about that the King will search
for the treasure that I have put into his dreams.
Moreover he will speak to others of this treasure,
and they, too, will search for it. It will come
about that these many searchers, digging for
the treasure, will break upq the foundations of
the Tower of Babylon. The upo I will take the
Magic Mirror and make n' fy emaster of the
Pabylonians."
This he said to me as
h him from the
King's palace along the
e Lions. I was
affrighted, and it seen
t the lions that
were in stone looked
yn on us as we
passed.
