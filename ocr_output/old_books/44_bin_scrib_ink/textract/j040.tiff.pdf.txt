of card or bristol board will prove of material assistance to

they run over and parallel with the groove. Then lay the webbing
over the frame, and see that the weavers run parallel with the
front of the frame. With wedge and mallet as illustrated in Fig.
29 begin at the front and force the webbing into the groove. Insert
on the opposite side next, then the other two sides in order. The
curves may be done last.
