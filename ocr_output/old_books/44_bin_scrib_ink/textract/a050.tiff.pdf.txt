the Illuminator, the Christian law with regard to the possion of woman has
moulded the thought of the nation, it has let its on the nation, and
it is this vital and essential difference betweer the law of T ahommed and the
law of Christ that like a two-edged S) ord has cles

If East is East, and West is West it is on

But this is not enough : if we mus rsist in holding to our our national-

failings and our national weaknesses, à find out in what essential charagter-

us weigh ourselves in the balance, and supply what in us is found wapting.
In the ueriod of less than a decade a Great Power has risen in the
Orient.
C
people of a small island empire with an empty Treasury have
