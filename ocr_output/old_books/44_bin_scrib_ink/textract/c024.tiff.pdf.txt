THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
came on without sails or oars. It was a shining
boat, a boat of brass. I called to my father and
my father straightened himself up and watched it.
In the boat that came toward us of its own accor
there was à man standing.
The boat came into the full water betwe
the
rocks, and then it sank down, this boat of
1
ss, un-
til its rim touched the water. It rema
still as
if anchored. The man who was in t)
ow of the
boat stepped out on the sand be
my father
and me.
He looked a man of high
like a prince
or a potentate. He had
e and a dark,
curly beard, and he b
e like hawks'
eyes. He had or
of a blue
material
is figures,
and in his
bed staff
that had th
ing to
gether. He lo
me a
ned of
him, and I tur!
my father
ther
was standing th
,
holding the fish
in
his hands, his mouth open, gasping like one
ne
fishes upon the rocks.
