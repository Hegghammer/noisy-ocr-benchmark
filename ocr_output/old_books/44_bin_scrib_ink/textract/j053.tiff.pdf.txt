Rectangular Seats.-As stated, in weaving a square seat the
initial process is repeated at all corners until all openings are filled.

method of filling in the center just described. It supplements the
photograph and makes the method clearer.
It should be noted that the strands in crossing at the center must

tapped sharply with a small mallet or hammer to produce proper
crowding. Fig. 44 shows a stool seat of fiber woven by an eighth
grade boy. Fig. 45 shows the complete stool. The seat is woven
