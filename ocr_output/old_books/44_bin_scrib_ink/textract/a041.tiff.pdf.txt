Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or "
is Descended." From the window of a neighboring l'oom he Night Tooked across
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now alkut close and buried
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling suow and hurricane that
cone of Ararol. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last puddle of the Delug
shore of eighty-seven years ago, Khrimian was born. In 1820
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land ; the Sultan still counted as or
able Powers or Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deli

from first to last it had been inspired by one absorbing and
R
regeneration of his people. It is true he had failed.
From his carliest years, when lie had witnessed the
e
homes of Armenians round Ararat, he was possessed
a

Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. W ith/varled motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian forum
himself summoned to plead his people's cause before the Congress of Berlin. Thougn lie
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Europe

had
done with success for the Lebanon. In London he became acepainted with Gladstone but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
