The reader will see at a glance the

mence with the Christian name. Then to

logical data, &c., and then the Christian na.
ildren and
order of births. In many of the early families
order of
births cannot be ascertained ; but it has been appros
as nearly
as possible. The lineage is given in connection with th
member
of the family. The Roman numerals indicate the ordery
births.
The sons and daughters or the old Puritan, Barnahas, constidute the
second generation, but they are spoken by way of eminence as Joseph
I., Hannah I., &C. The book contains much repetition, but none
too much to make it plain and easy to study.
This little book contains the chronicles of only about one-half of
the Horton families looked up. Those whose genealogical data are
given only in a small part, and those whose correct lineage has not
been satisfactorily ascertained, are not included in this book.
