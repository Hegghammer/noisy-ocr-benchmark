was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples which with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engage fill
commierce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase the of
mg
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few ainong them justly started an agitation these our noble
and industrious brethren were being massacred. What a kralited scene! When we
left the school building we saw hund eds of the bodies of our rmenian compatriots being
removed in manume carts legs and were hanging down outside. This bloody scene will
ever remain impressed on my mind.
" This shecking crime of Yildi

whole course of a cursed absolutism
0 the last moment, grew wider. Even during the
past nine months of the Constitutio

the awful events in Adana took pla
the souls of all true Osmanlis melted into tears.
Up to the present time the deep so

bloody wound in our social body es

choice morsels, while we rest selfis
comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans, widows hungry, haked,
wander hither and thither, and thousands of
families are fleeing from the fathe

work, but what has happened is
amity that it can keep a government buly for
years. However much sacrifice

happiness of the fatherland depe:
juch blood wounds as these as soon as possible.
We are convineed that the gover

ourselves. We must now wipe

We must now comfort weeping
those who do not
understand that patriotism and

of the government for the Arm

nation is under obligations to Il

IS intharge part due to the

were so obvious that we

that this unhappy pe

Hereafter we must wor

them is also very heavy, b use our Armenian countrymen Pamong wandering tribes.
We must all assist the vernment and point out its obligation. It must be declared

in
public and periodically that the one of the most important duties of the Ottoman nation is to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and property of the
Armenians as well, since these are their saered rights. Let investigations be made and let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim."
This article of the Turkish officer, who however coos not dare disclose
his identity ; andithe account given by an authority like Mr. James Brys
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the

Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
