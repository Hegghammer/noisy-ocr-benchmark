Southold. It is still a long old gun, though not as long as it was
once, as it was bursted by overloading on one Thanksgiving Day, and
about eight or ten inches of the muzzle cut off.
The CASK, in which he packed a portion of his household goeds
Proceinat
and brought over with him, is still in existence, and is ewned by
Gilbert W. Horton, of Bay View, Southold. It is doubly historic
from the fact that when the British invaded Long Island it was filled
with wheat and buried, thus securing the wheat from the foraging
parties of the British army. It is made of solid bak-hoops and all-
the hoops are square and about an inch and a quarter thick-only one
hoop missing. It is used for a grain cask, and will hold about fifteen
bushels. It was formerly called "uncle Barney's money barrel,"
as
romance had it, that he brought it over full of gold and silver.
His WALKING STAFF is still preserved. It is made of the Yew tree
wood, has a fine ivory head with the letters "J. H.' and the figures
'1617" in apparently golden specks indented into it, from which it
would seem that it once belonged to his fatl' and that J. H. (Joseph
Horton) were his initials. It is no

THE HORTO
OUNTRY.
The word Morton'in
an enclosure,
or garden of vegetaly

ort, meaning plant,

Ur
Latin origin, and
know in England ever since the conquest
of Cassar.

The Hortons in England, and their descendants in America, have
generally been cultivators of the soil. They have been found almost
universally in the middle class of society, and it is not known that
any royal blood has ever coursed in their venis. They are, and always
have been, produces rather than consumers, and for industry, integ-
rity, and piett, they will lose nothing in a comparison with the re-
nowned families of either the new or the old world.
The first of the family who emigrated to this country, of whom we
have any authentic record, came over from England I633 to 1638.
Thomas, Jeremiah, and Barnabas, were among the early emigrants,
and old tradition says they were brothers. Thomas came over in the
" Mary and John," in 1633, settled permanently in Springfield, Mass.
