CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
No. III.
Two COUCHANT LIONS, AFTER RUBENS, taken from his celebrated picture before alluded
to, of the Prophet Daniel incarcerated in the den. The Lions are here supposed to be miraculously
held in a state of tranquillity. Here, too, is not much Expression, but an extraordinary grandeur
of Character, suited to the greatness of an occasion where the Deity himself especially interferes
to seal up the voracious energies of the most terrible of nis creatures, in calm submission. There
is a character of royal dignity mingled with this submission, which is very impressive, and even
sublime.
The writer esteems this to be a successful rest ation of the Nature that was wanting in the
prints of this subject, (which has often been engray by PICART and others,) after RUBENS. The
original picture it has been our ill-fortune never liave seen. The shaggy manes, and the latent
terror that sits gloomily enthroned in the open es of the superior Lion-suited to the darkness of
the den, and the nature of this animal's ser of vision, are as wok thought of, as they are
executed ; and are varied with much addres fom eyes df the couching Lion beyond,
of which also the character is most han marked. A powerful and divine spell possesses
them both.

quadruped ; whose very t

nerves, has an appallip

These Leopards
