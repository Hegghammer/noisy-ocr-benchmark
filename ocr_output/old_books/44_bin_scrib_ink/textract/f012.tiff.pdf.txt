PREFACE
from Smith, who himself was prone to include
the most extraragant myths in his pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE LIVES AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAMOUS
HIGHWAYMEN Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the "truth" of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.
No one has ever reprinted those authors in

It would be impossible; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
them, or even written an independent history of
the highwaymen.

oub-mouthed and
cruel, and often coward.

to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
