CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
and carnivorous habits. They walk on their toes : yet not so much from that habitual stealthiness
of pace, by which they advance unperceived till within a spring of their prey ; as because it is also
the means of that celerity of motion which is necessary to the very existence of animals that can
fleed only on flesh.
Their claws are exceedingly powerful; and they are enabled to draw them up into sheaths
between their toes, so as to prevent their points from touching the ground ; whence they are
und retractile; and those claws are, in consequence, always kept sharp, unworn, and ready for
ryice.

If a stran
ar a Tiger in a menagerie,
the colour of the animal's eyes in
etimes alter suddenly,
uv-green to blue-green ;
not from any alteration in the degree of light acting upon them, but
ental excitement, and
from a certain natural facility of expansion and contraction of the eye-pupils.
Hence a characteristic difference betwee n the Lion and the Tiger. The habits of the latter
are diurnal, and he disregards night-fires: the Lion, on the contrary, whose eyes are not calculated
for the glare of day, cannot bear to encounter fire-ligh at night. Yet these physical conforma-
tions are sometimes overcome by the rage of hunger; And hence, in MR. EDWIN LANDSEER'S
contending group, the Lion is represented as attacking the Tiger although it be day.

this class of quadrupeds, in his " Anatomy of Expression.". - We shall offer a few extracts, by
which the reader will perceive how limited are their powers of expression of countenance, when
compared with those of human nature, notwithstanding their superiority over all other quadrupeds.
" The violent passions mark themselves so distinctly on the countenances both of men and
of animals, that we are apt in the first instance to consider the movements by which they are
indicated, as certain signs or characters provided by Natnee, for the express purpose of intimating
the internal emotion ; and to suppose that they are interproted by the-observer in consequence of a
peculiar and instinctive faculty. Thie view of things, howeyer, so natural at first sight, is not
altogether satisfactory to philosophy ; and a more jealous ohservation of the facts, seems to suggest
