The amateur will a his greatest difficulty in properly weaving
the diagonals at the ledges that is, immediately upon entering or
leaving a hole. Many commendable pieces of caning are spoiled
by ragged, improperly woven edges. Care must be taken to see
that the cane goes over and under the proper strand or strands at
these points. Fig. 6 clearly shows how the diagonals should ruif.
Study it carefully.
The addition of a binder is generally a matter of taste. Perhaps
50 per cent of modern hard caned furniture does not employ a
binder of any description. The series of regularly exposed holes
are rather pleasing and in no way detract. However, in chair seats
a binder is essential to protect the ends of canes, for they are subject
to hard wear.
Binders of reed or of wood called "splines" may be used on hand-
caned frames. If either is used a groove 1/4 in. deep and 3/16 in.
