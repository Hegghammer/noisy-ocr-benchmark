WHY AND WHEREFORE.
7
In making a study of my race, I have found three marked characteristics
Intelligence—Energy—Industry. Combined with these three characteristics
is an intense Love of Nationality. We live in a complex world. In an
independent people these characteristics and this sentiment are laudable
Virtues. In a subject people they are Crimes.
After I had laid this bitter Truth to heart, I did not have to seek for the
Why and Wherefore of the Armenian Massacres
The Armenian Massacres stand without allel in history. The
human mind staggers to contemplate the fie
of which they have
been the victims, and no pen can describ
nd this helpless
christian people are to-day in the sam
ave been since
the famous Treaty of Berlin consi
foot to the
mercy of their executioners,
The Armenians may be
as sheep to the -
and the
work of extermination m²
pleted Jesus Christ was
Calvary and the servant is not greater than his Lord—but the work
extermination can only be completed when the evil influences in the Turk.
Empire have reached their culminating point. Hitherto the Powers of
Europe have by their jealousies and rivalries cultivated these evil influences,
they have watered them and made them grow, but when their culminating
point is reached, they must re-act on Christendom and the natural
consequence must follow. Those who sow the wind, must reap the whirl-
wind. It is in the natural order of things.
1 will allow that Liberty, Justice, Equality, Fraternity are the watchwords
of Young Turkey, but Young Turkey is only a small minority; the great
majority of the Turkish nation are not Young Turks.
The question therefore resolves itself into this critical point: “What will
Christendom do even now?"
