CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.
THAT there
ngravings of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the progress
Art, is to be regretted. The talents
of Mr. JOHN SCOTT, brough
PIN, COOPER, and the REINAGLES,
have presented the public with exce
the distinguished ornaments of the
turf: the sports of the field, and the ha
the canine race, were also duly
honoured: but of the ferocious TIGER tribe, and
ve nothing extant that
would bear critical inspection, beyond a few detached
collection of
figures, whose justness and accuracy of form, action, character, and expo
relied on.
Does any reader imagine that the various Etchings whic have been performed-chiefly
abroad-by Artists of no mean ability, may be considered as exceptions? They are not exceptions:
or at best, the number which might be so regarded is but small, and those, for the most part, of
dimensions not accommodated to the drawer of the cabinet, or the shelf of the library.
But they are not objectionable on this ground alone. Speaking of them in the aggregate, the
heavier charge lies against them of being insufficient to those purposes of taste and information
which are the ends of Art. Even those after TITIAN and after RUBENS (the latter of whom has

form, character, and expression, than is generally supposed, or than will be easily believed, by
those who have not actually compared them with the Lions, Leopards, and Tigers of Nature.
They have been taken too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
-Nor is this intended to impugn the merits, as historical or poetical painters, of those distinguished
Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that as a painter of allegory, RUBENS
might consider that strong infusion of human form, character, and expression, by which his Lions,
for example, are distinguished, as necessary, or conducive, to his allegorical purposes; or, it is pos-
sible that his knowledge of this animal may not have been thoroughly well-grounded, and that he
may have laboured under early prejudice of mind, or of vision, in this part of his education as a
Painter, and may not have seen Lions as they really are. This is what the writer is most inclined
to believe, (though not to insist); for even in treating the subject of Daniel in the den of Lions-
