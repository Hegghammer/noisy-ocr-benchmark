thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the feared fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history.
At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nercès, the Patriarch, their object being to request the signatory Powers of
the Berlin Treaty to force a guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.
Abdul Hamid and his advisers were furious at this affront, and Monseigneur Nercès was
summoned to the Palace. It is said to when he received the summons he simply smiled
and asked one of of his curates to read Burial Service to him, as he did not expect to
return alive. However, he went. No ever heard what passed between the Sultan
and himself at the interview; suffice itu he immediately summoned the Armenian

heavy curtains over the doorway hrown apart, revealing the ghastly pale face of his
servant Vartan, who cried, in Armen, in a voice trembling with emotion, "Monseigneur,
I did not brew the coffee!"
This was enough for the Archhop; he pretended to be startled and spilt the coffee, but,
alas! he had already drunk a small quantity of it. Meanwhile a scufle was going on behind
the portière, where his poor servant Vartan was paying the penalty of his devotion to his
master. Concerning Vartan's whereabouts or his ultimate end nothing was ever made public
