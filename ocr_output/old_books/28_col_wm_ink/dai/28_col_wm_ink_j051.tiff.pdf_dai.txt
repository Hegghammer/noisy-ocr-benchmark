the end in place. Draw the strand over the edge and bottom of
rail 1 and up at the inner corner, then over the top and edge of rail
2. This binds the loose end in place if it has not been previously
tacked. Pull the strand directly across the frame opening to the
top of rail 3 at corner B. Draw it over the edge of the same rail
and under, then up at the inner corner and over the top and edge
of rail 1. Pull directly across the frame opening to the top of rail
4 at corner C. The perations at corners C and D are identical to

only. The end o strand may be secured with a tack under
the proper rail,

piece at a time is ded. The upper or top end of the leaf is
used to begin the and each leaf added is attached at its top
end.
Some expert rus
s do not tie knots in making strands, but
add leaves by twis end of the preceding leaf about the added
one, "like the col on a barber pole," as one old rush weaver re-
marked. Adding by twisting only is difficult, and requires great
patience and dextrous handling of the material. In fact rush
should be used by the more skilful boys only. Others may use the
excellent substitute, fiber.
