PART I.
THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN,
Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the ing of the still more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the up
Armenian nation stands without
its parallel in history.
In the Guildhall at Berlin
e of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July
The painter has depicted
the proud array of representa
Governments of Europe,
but in the interests of Hum
attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of
ritten in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).
It was a curious in
hough the taking of "the
terrible stronghold of K
atted to be one of the greatest
and most difficult milita
ieved, and the crowning success
of the Russian arms in A
should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General; tha
Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest,
menian soldiers fought, conquered and
died, yet by these successed only was no amelioration attained of the
hard fate of their unhappation under Turkish rule, but that fate, hard
before, was made a hund dfold and even a thousandfold harder.
GENERAL FRINCE LOHIS MELIKOFF.
Commanded the Russian forces in Asiatic Turkey
during the Russo-Turkish war and captured the im-
pregnable fortress of Kars. Appointed Prime Minister
of Russia by Alexander II. The liberal policy which
characterized the reign of that excellent monarch, and
the Constitution that he was on the eve of granting to
his people were influenced by Melikoff; but after the
death of Alexander II he was not allowed to continue in
his good work of reforming Russia, being overthrown
from office early in the reign of Alexander III.
