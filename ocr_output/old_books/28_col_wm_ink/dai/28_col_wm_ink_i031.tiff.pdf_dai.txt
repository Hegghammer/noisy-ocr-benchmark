THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
I mean those in the staterooms. I cannot
speak with certainty in regard to the port-
ho on deck E. I believe that the first list
hip took brough her down to these
orts on th
rd side and that
kly from filling
eu
k m
felt that the
HOW
nge any mo-
othing more that
could be de
e-for there was
no disciplin
hich to do it-I
passed thro
ard side. Men
were striving
boats and were
putting wome
to them, but it
seemed to me that
ded horror to
the whole situation to people into a
boat that you knew never would be cleared
and which would go down with the steamer;
better leave them on the deck to let them
take their chance at a piece of wreckage.
