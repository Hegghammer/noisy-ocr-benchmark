seen
from Smith, who himself was prone to include
the most extravagant myths in his pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE LIVES AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAMOUS
HIGHWAYMEN. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the truth of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.

of the
e almost insuperable difficulty
fact from fiction, and because of a
sense that it would be a thankless task
present the highwayman as he really was :
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No novelist would
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dis-
service; and I do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
