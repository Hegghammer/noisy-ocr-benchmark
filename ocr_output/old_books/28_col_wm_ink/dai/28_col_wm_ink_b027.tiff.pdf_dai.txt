CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

No. VI.
In this GROUP by MR. EDWIN LANDSEER there is much of violent animal Expression, and
Character fades before it, or rather, is absorbed in it. It tells a story of the past as well as the
present, and is pregnant with a catastrophe not difficult to anticipate from the actions and
expressions of the parties engaged. A FAWN has been seized by a LEOPARD, who has been
despoiled of his prey by a more powerful TIGER. The Tiger in his turn becomes the victim of an
enraged LION.
The expression of the wounded Leopard is that of painful suffering mingled with dread.
Together, they amount to agony. He shrieks while he submits. The Tiger is still enraged and
resisting, though astounded with the power and suddenness of the Lion's attack. He is losing his
energy of resistance, and is beginning to feel that all resistance is vain. He roars with anguish;
while his expression is that of terror, and indignation not yet subdued.
The Lion, who has just made his thundering spr appears conscious of having fatally seized
his adversary, and luxuriates fearlessly in his victor with a powerful and just expression of
carnivorous enjoyment. Meanwhile the charact animals, severally, are faithfully and

page, (No. I.) They form a tribe s especially and properly Carnivorous, eing the only
class of quadrupeds that are exclus flesh-eaters. Their jaws are very completely armed for
this purpose; their canine teeth bein ery long and angular, with the edges of the angles turned
toward the inside of their mouths; so hat when the animal has caused them meet, or cross each
other in the flesh of its prey, these formidable teeth will cut or tear a way through, by drawing
them back without opening his mouth.
Their claws, and the formation of their feet, too, are eminently conducive to their predacious
