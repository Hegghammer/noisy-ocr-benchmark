PREFACE
On the analog of the famous apple, "there ain't
going to be no" reface, "not nohow." Children do
not read preface so anything of a prefatory nature
that might interes hem is put at the beginning of chap-
ter one.
As for the grows the story is not written for grown-
ups, and if they w to know why it begins with such a
gruesome first cha let them ask the children. Chil-
dren like the horre st and the end all bright. Many
grown-ups like the dy at the end. But perhaps the
children are right he grown-ups are standing on
their heads. Besi an skip the first chapter; it is
only a prologue.
