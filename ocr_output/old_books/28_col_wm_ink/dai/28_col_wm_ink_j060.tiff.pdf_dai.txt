Primitive Methods.-Briefly the primitive process of convert-
ing the rattan, or raw material, into cane and reeds, or the finished
product, is this: The rattan stems are thoroly dried or seasoned,
and the nodules are pared off with a peculiar native knife. Then the
rattan is sorted into sizes and selection made as to grade. The sort-

These are rounded by drawing them thru a sh tin or iron

Considerable rattan is still converted into the finished products
by hand processes thru these laborious stages. Machines have been
perfected which do practically the entire work. Particularly have
the Germans brought this industry to a perfected state. Still in
various sections of India, China, and the Philippines hand working
of rattan is a thriving industry; an industry seemingly peculiarly
adapted to the natives. The Philippine method of preparing the
raw material varies somewhat from the Chinese method in that the
natives do not bleach the rattan.
Reed may be procured in large or small hanks, in coils and in
bundles, with the cost determined by weight. Schools generally
will find it advantageous to buy it in small hanks, because of ease in
handling and for economic reasons. Round reeds are shown
