description of corsets worn by the ladies of Rome was no doubt at that

corsage known as cottes hardies, which were much stiffened and worn
extremely tight. These took the place of the quaint, oddly-formed
robes we see draping the figures of Childeric's and Pepin's queens. The
“cottes hardies” were, moreover, clasped at the waist by a broad belt, and
