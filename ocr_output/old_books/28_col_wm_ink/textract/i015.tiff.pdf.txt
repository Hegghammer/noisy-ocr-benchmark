Remember that they know not what they do
Who strike in deadly fel and ghastly hate;
Remember that someh v, and at some time,
Each crime exacts it uman penalty.
Remember that I2
science and man's mind
Are agents of T
se and Thy plan,
Which work y
adlier revenge
Than any
t or
B
ons come
and the curse,
reds and past wrongs,
the struggle and despair.
Tain, O God, the sweep of this vast hate;
Recall the nations to their sense of shame:
To those in blinding war, to us at peace,
Reveal anew the message of the Christ.
