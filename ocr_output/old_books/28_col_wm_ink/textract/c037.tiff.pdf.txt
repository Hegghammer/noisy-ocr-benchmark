THE STORY OF EEAN THE FISHERMAN'S SON
on the ass, and the ass is driven back over the
mountains into the country that they came from,
these men.
And in such boats we went down the river an
came into Babylon. No city in the worl
mighty or as wonderful as Babylon
free
hundred a
fue streets
str et
there are thre
pa laces,
and to every palact
ndred and
sixty-five steps leading th
or of gold and
ebony. The streets when
in
into them
were thronged with mighty, black-be ded men. I
was much in dread when I stood in thr se great
streets, and looked on the mighty men who vent
through them
In the cente of the city were the palace and the
wide-spreadin ardens of the King. In those
gardens, as my master told me, were one or two of
all the beautiful or terrible animals of the world.
Those gardens I will speak of again, O King,
for it was within them that I came upon the
danger that was greater than the danger that
I am now in.
