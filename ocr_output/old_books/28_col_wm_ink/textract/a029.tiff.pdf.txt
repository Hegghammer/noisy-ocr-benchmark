Commanded the Russian forces in Asiatic Turkey
during the Russo-Turkish war and captured the im-

of Russia by Alexander II. The liberal policy which
characterized the reign of that excellent monarch, and
the Constitution that he was on the ere of granting to
his people were influenced by Melikoft ; but after the
death of Alexander II he was not allowed to continue in
his good work of reforming Russia, being overthrown
from office early in the reign of Alexander III.
