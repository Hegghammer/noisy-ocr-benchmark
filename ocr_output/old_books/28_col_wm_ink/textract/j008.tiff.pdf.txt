expected of boys in that grade, and, in a measure, the first two years
of high school.
Practically the entire emphasis is laid upon weaving as applied
to some form of seat, either as a decorative feature or as a necessary
part of the structure. These materials may be utilized in various
ways on varied types and forms of furniture other than seats, a few
of which are suggested. Experience with them will lead the worker
to new and interesting fields of a distinctly educational nature.
