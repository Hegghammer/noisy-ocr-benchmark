THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
I mean those in the staterooms. I cannot
speak with certainty in regard to the port-
ho
on deck E. I believe that the first list
t]
hip took brougl ner down to these
borts on tb
rd side and that
hk my
dly from filling
felt that the
mage any mo-
othing more that
could be de
1-e- there was
no disciplin
hich to do it-I
passed thro
ard side. Men
were strivin,
boats and were
putting wome
to them, but it
seemed to me that
Ided horror to
the whole situation to
people into a
boat that you knew never W ild be cleared
and which would go down with the steamer;
better leave them on the deck to let them
take their chance at a piece of wreckage.
