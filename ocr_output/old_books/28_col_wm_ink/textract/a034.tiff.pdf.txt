O: ll sins in this world, perhaps the sin of Bolishness receives the
severes punishment, and of all crimes, the of failure meets with the

their own blood, and for
failure they were made to
wallow
hat blood. The darl
fir history have been written
in the -

If
whole history of Europe's inter-
course
ests of the Macedonian Alexander;
they

interest only

GENERAL TER GOUKASSOFF.
Relieved the beleaguered Russian garrison
at Bayazid during the Russo-Turkish war of
1877, captured the fortress ; and otherwise
distinguished himself during the war.
The other Armenian General who dis-
tinguished himself during the Russo-Turkish
war was General Lazaroff.
