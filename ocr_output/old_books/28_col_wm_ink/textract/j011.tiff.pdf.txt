ber of plants
which possess long
feedlike stems.

height. They en fall over and lie on the ground. The stem is
covered with cautiful green foliage, grows to a length of 100 to
300 ft., and exceeds I in. in diameter. The stems are cut
into lengths of 10 to 20 ft. for export. The outer bark is stripped
into widths varying from 1/16 to 3/16 in. These strips are put
into hanks of 1,000 lineal feet each. The cane is then ready for
