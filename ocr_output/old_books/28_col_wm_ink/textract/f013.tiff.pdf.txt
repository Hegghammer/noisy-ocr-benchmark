PREFACE

Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific his-
torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and excluted the villains, for whom of old no
mud was too thick and slab. Beliefs are being
assailed on every side. To abolish the traditional
courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the considerate
conduct of Captain Hind would, therefore, be
strokes of the unkindest, and I have here attempted
no such Even where I cannot be-
lieve, I have told the tale-wchenever it has been
worth the tell'r as it is found in criminal
trials, or in Sm
or Toknson and other old
sources, decorously
d of much vile language.
For

turns out nou
'tis your only way.
To continnie
bighwaymen from
Smith und Johnson
the
proaching end
of all such things in
CA
of the nine-
teenth century, is like taking
recunding
a half-told tale. But it was
doing.
Only in respect of the great figure
m has
always maile, has it been found really The essary
to seriously consider and re-state the career of
that much-overrated scoundrel, and to put him
in his proper place : a very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
