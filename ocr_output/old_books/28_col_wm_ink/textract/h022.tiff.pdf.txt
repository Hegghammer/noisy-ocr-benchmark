once, as it was bursted by overloading on one Thanksgiving Day, and
about eight or ten inches of the muzzle cut off.

THE HORTON NAME-FIRST.SETTLERS IN THIS COUNTRY.
The word Horton in the Anglo-Saxon language means an enclosure,
or garden of vegetables. It is said to be derived from ort and tun,
ort, meaning plant, and tun, enclosed. The name is evidently of
Latin origin, and has been known in England ever since the conquest
of Caesar.
The Hortons in England, and their descendants in America, have
generally been cultivators of the soil. They have been found almost
universally in the middle class of society, and it is not known that
any royal blood has ever coursed in their veins. They are, and always
have been, producers rather than consumers, and for industry, integ-
rity, and piety, they will lose nothing in a comparison with the re-
nowned families of either the new or the old world.
The first of the family who emigrated to this country, of whom we
have any authentic record, came over from England IG33 to 1638.
Thomas, Jeremiah, and Barnabas, were among the early emigrants,
and old tradition says they were brothers. Thomas came over in the
" Mary and John," in 1633, settled permanently in Springfield, Mass.
