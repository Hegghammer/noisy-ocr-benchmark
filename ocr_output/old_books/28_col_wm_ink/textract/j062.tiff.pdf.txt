hours. Remove it from the tub and wash thoroly in running
water. The best way to do this is to lay the reed on an inclined
surface and turn a forceful stream of water upon it. Chloride of
lime has a bad effect upon the hands in that it makes them sore and
tender, so care must be taken to properly rinse the reed. A little
tallow rubbed over the hands will materially offset the tendency to
tenderness, and generally keep them in good condition
Staining.-Bleached reed takes stain much more readily and
evenly than does the natural or unbleached.
It
may
be
stained
any
color with prepares stains, but ordinarily these leave the reed
muddy in appeara
due primarily to the difficulty in brushing in
or wiping off
in the recesses which weaving leaves. Per-
haps the best
coloring reed, and at least a very desirable
one, especi
been woven, is naptha. The preparation
of the
S
ISS of coloring is as follows: Obtain the
necess
ty of colors ground in oil; mix the re-
qui
aptha; then to determine the shade of

out practically the same when tested
as when tried out with a greater
at of naptha to the solution, avoid-
e color produced will be "sickly"
in ap
or to about 3 gallons of naptha
will prove ano
instance, to obtain a rich nut
brown mix I pound OI
and 5 pounds of burnt umber
with a small amount of naptita
until the colors are liquid,
then gradually add 4 gallons or so OF aptha, and stir well. The
intensity of the brown may be varied by using more or less chrome
yellow.
Coiled hanks of reed may be immersed in the solution, immedi-
ately withdrawn and hung to drain dry above the receptacle, thus
permitting surplus stain to drain back into it. The stain may be
used repeatedly, and as it is very volatile it should be kept in a
tightly corked red can when not in use. It is also highly inflam-
