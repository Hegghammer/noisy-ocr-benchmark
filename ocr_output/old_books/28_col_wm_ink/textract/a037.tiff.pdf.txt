No one doubts that a great forward mavement is reaching its culminat-
ing point in the destiny of Asia. The We has learnt its all of religion (the

The Christian Arme
n Turkey live in the midst of the followers
of a hostile religion, with
ower or force behind them which makes for
protection. Who does
now that the great numerical preponderance of
Hinduism keeps the bala of power in India, and restrains bloody religious
hostilities and when review the whole religious history of Christian
Europe, and that terril long roll of crimes committed in the name of Him
who expounded His re (on with the parable of the Good Samaritan, and
the precept of loving de's neighbour as one's self, we cannot feel surprise at
the fanatical outburs of the followers of Mahommed, the founder of a
religion whose doctrines certainly fall short of the humane principles
inculcated by the Founder of Christianity. If authentic historical facts prove
to us that horrible and atrocious cruelties have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other religionists, but on fellow Christians of different
denominations, how then can we expect better things from the Turk unless
some power or force restrain him ?
Christianity has now partly emancipated herself from the ferocities
which darkened and poured the red stream of blood on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at large, religion is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite.
