Preface.--Introduction. -
than over a half a century, and lastly Jonathan G. Horton, about a
half a century ; making in all two hundred and thirteen years at the
death of Jonathan G. Horton, 3 July, 1873. These six generations
all living and dying in the old mansion ! Could those old walls re-
echo all the words ever spoken there, and exhibit anew all the scenes
ever witnessed there-the book containing such a record would vastly
exceed in volume the size of the old castle. It would bring to light
much that is now in darkness, and must forever remain widden from
the generations of the living.
At the death of Jonathan G. Horton, the old
estead became,
by will, the property of the Rev. Mrs. William
Brooklyn, N. Y.,
who was the adopted daughter of Jonatha
Horton, he never
having had issue, SO that on the 3d of Jul
the old homestead
went out of the Horton name.
Mrs. Williams proposes to sell it
some of the Hortons do
not buy it, it will indicate a lack
respect for the old castle,
if not for the Horton name.
be bought back into the
Horton name, suitably repar
eserved for the wonder and
admiration of generation
ns yet unborn. Jonathan G.
Horton, the short, thin
tuart T. Terry, are the two men
seen in the engravin
he old house.
Mr. Stuart T.
