Proface.-Introduction
It is said that Barnabas Horton I. was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities.
His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It is elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. The original base was of brick, but it had all crumbled down
many years ago. The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Horton.
The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and
follows:
"Here lieth buried the body of MR. BARNABAS HORTON
born at
Mousely, Leicestershire, Old England, and died at Southol
th
day of
July, I680, aged 8o years."
In the centre of the stone we find the
bllows :
" Here lies my body tomb
'Till Christ shall com
ust ;
My soul ascended
Where with swe
abode
Then hasten
wife,
To be partal
life;
And you,
ollow the Lord,
Hear and
sacred word;
And in
upon His name,
For oft
d you to the same:
Then
55 you with your children all,
sed place He will you call."
Heb. xi :4 _"He
ad, yet speaketh."
It is said th
epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with t iscription, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon
the
ste
before he died. He was the only one of the original
thirteen
W
brought his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate commendable desire to see that his name and memory
should not perish from the earth.
