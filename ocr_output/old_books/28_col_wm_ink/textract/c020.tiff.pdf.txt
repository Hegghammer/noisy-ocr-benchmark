"Your danger is great," said the King, "and it
will be hard for you to show us that you were
ever in such danger before. Begin your story
And if it is not a story of a narrow and a close
escape there will be little time left for you to pre-

was close to I
atever was given
me of my saving nly

greater than is my danger now.

who had tried to steal the white horse that King
Manus owned, began the story which is set down
