CHAPTER II
CANING SUGGESTIONS
As weaving progresses difficulty will be experienced in inserting
cane ends in the holes, due to their beroming filled. Force the
scratch awl thru and turn it several t
S.
This will effectively
force an opening.
In many instances long ends of
hain from one series to
another. These generally as prey
tioned, should be used
in succeeding steps. There is
on. They should be
used provided it is not necessar,
over more than four
holes on the under side of the
wer loose ends left,
the better, for the caning iss
better. It is gener-
ally advisable to use a
void a number of
loose ends.
The amateur will fr
properly weaving
the diagonals at the
pon entering or
leaving a hole. Man
ing are spoiled
by ragged, imprope woven
e taken to see
that the cane goes/over and under
or strands at
these points. Fig 6 clearly shows how
should run.
Study it carefully.
The addition of a binder is generally a matter of taswe. Perhaps
50 per cent of modern hand caned furniture does not employ
a
binder of any description. The series of regularly exposed holes
are rather pleasing and in no way detract. However, in chair seats
a binder is essential to protect the ends of canes, for they are subject
to hard wear.
Binders of reed or of wood called "splines" may be used on hand-
caned frames. If either is used a groove 1/4 in. deep and 3/16 in.
