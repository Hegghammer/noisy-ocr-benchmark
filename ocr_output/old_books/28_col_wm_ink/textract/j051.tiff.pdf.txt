rail I and up at the inner corner, then over the top and edge of rail
2. This binds the loose end in place if it has not been previously
tacked. Pull the strand directly across the frame opening to the
top of rail 3 at corner B. Draw it over the edge of the same rail
and under, then up at the inner corner and over the top and edge
of rail I. Pull directly across the frame opening to the top of rail

patience and dextrous handling of the material. In fact rush
should be used by the more skilful boys only. Others may use the
excellent substitute, fiber.
