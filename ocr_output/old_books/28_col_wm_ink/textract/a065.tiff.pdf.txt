Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and 18 grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another
om which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for then
ve been exempt ; this super-added evil, is, the
large neigbouring bod
and Circassians, greater marauders and
depredators than the T
occupation of whose lives comprises
murder and robbery, and
weary centuries unremittingly
quartered themselves upon
an peasants, and lived on
the fruits of their labour and to
midich cavalry wh
was established expressly for
t.
as como
these Kurds, it ought to be matter
th
trained and practised in organized 111
which they were encouraged and
régime.
Under all such conditions no hope of
L
K,
no prospect of better times seems possible, for
he
Armenian race whom force of circumstances
he
fatherland.
The appointment of Christian governors
O
in-
habited by them might ameliorate some of the evils, O
Ive,
of allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespe
or
nationality, would furnish some means of self-defence
aids
and barbarities of the oppressors ; but even if such concessio.
ited,
life for the christian peasant subject to Turkish rule, and livin
hidst
of his enemies, must remain one long struggle and battle aga
lage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Not the 11
ertile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the most a duous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, can bring lo the
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
happiness, and security of life and property, which the law of all civilized
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil.
