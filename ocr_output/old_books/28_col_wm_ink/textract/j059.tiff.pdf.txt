CHAPTER VI
REED AND SPLINT WEAVING
Reeds which are used extensively for basket-making and weavy
in general are procured from the species of palm described in
ter I. These reeds should not be confused with the

diameters and widths. The outer bark

sizes, is known as chair cane; the entire
leaves removed,
is commercially known as rattan and
ds are frequently
sold as flat rattan and pith cane. Inasn
mese flat and round
strips, split from the palm plant and

rattan are called reeds, we shall refer
em under that name in
all discussions to follow. There are the qualities of reed on the
market sold under the names of China feed and German reed. The
former is inferior in quality and the latter is superior, being strong,
tough and durable. The Philippine Islands give promise of pro-
ducing a liberal supply of reed of good quality that is claimed to
equal the German product. The problem, however, is one of gath-
ering and marketing the product. The government has made a
partial survey of the rattan supply, and this justifies the belief that
the Islands will eventually compete with the world market.
