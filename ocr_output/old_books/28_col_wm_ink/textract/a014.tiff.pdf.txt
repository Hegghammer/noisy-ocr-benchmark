MASSACRES IN ASIA MINOR.
armed mob strengthened and augmented by soldiers
fell in
ming
unarmed Christians. The Armenian population of
Antiod
vicinity were
wiped out and the Armenian villages in the
Alexar
tta district destroyed
se loss of life. Hadjim, Kessab and the neigh-
bouring villages were burned. The Armenno quarter in Tarsus was ruined and ill-omened
Marash stained again with the blood of thousands of Armenians. Zeitoon was desolated. The
entire population of Kirikon between Aleppo and Alexandretta were massacred to the last
habe. The mob and the soldiers burned what they could not carry away, so that the material
loss has been enormous. In place of the former abundance and thriving industries there are
instead desolated provinces and the charred and blackened remains of pillaged and ruined
homes, and the residue of those who escaped massacre are reduced to homelessness and
starvation.
