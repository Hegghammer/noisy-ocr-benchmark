CANING; THE SEVEN STEPS 13
open squares are thus formed over the area being caned. Unless
‘the cane is soaked it will prove rather difficult to pair the canes.

his step is identical with the preceding one. The canes

pr g one note that two strands run into the corner holes.
Th® holds true in all rectangular frames where a corner hole is
bored. It permits the strands to run in as straight a line as pos-
sible. If it is necessary to turn abruptly to enter a hole it is obvious
that an error has been made by the weaver.
Step 7. Pull a cane of the same size as used in the other steps up
thru a hole, over the binder cane and down thru the same hole.
A loop is thus formed and the binder secured. Pull taut, then
