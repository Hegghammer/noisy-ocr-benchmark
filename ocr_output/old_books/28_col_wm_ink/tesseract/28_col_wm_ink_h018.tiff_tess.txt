Vi Preface.—I Introduction.

It is said that Barnabas Horton I. was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities.

His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It is elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. ‘The original base was of brick, but it had all crumbled down
many years ago. The present base was put under the stone at th
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Horton.

The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and
follows:

“ere lieth buried the body of Mr. BARNABAS HORTON orn at
Mousely, Leicestershire, Old England, and died at South Ki day of
July, 1680, aged 80 years.” /

In the centre of the stone we find the § lows:

« Here lies my body tomly

?Till Christ shall con ust 5 :

My soul ascended

Where with sw abod

Then haste: wife,

To be partaly fe ;

And 5 d llow the Lord,

Hear and sacred word ;

And in upon His name,

For off you to the same:

Ther s you with your children all,

d Bed place He will you call.”
Teb, xi: 4,—H. d, yet speaketh.”

It is said epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with scription, date of his death excepted,-was all put
upon the st before he died. He was the only one of the original
thirteen wAaWbrought his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate 7commendable desire to see that his name and memory ~
should fot perish from the earth.
