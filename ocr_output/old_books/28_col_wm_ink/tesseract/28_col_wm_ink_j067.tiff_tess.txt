CHAPTER VII
SEATS OF REEDS AND SPLINTS

The discussion of the weaving processes to follow is confined,
in the main, to stools or seats. Fig. 53 shows several stools different
in design both in wood construction and in weaving. In two in-
stances it will be noted that weaving is done over_a separate frame,
one being inserted between the rails, the other fastened on top,

The stool top illus 4 employs a simple over-and-

the outset on the Of weave to be used unless it be of
unusual design. nstance the weaver runs over three and

To begin the op§ation tack an end of flat reed under a short rail
at a corner, then bring the strand out and over the rail, across the
frame opening to the opposite rail, under this rail, across under-
neath the frame opening to the bottom of the first rail. This com-
pletes the process once around. Repeat three times; then wrap the
strand around the two rails, without running it across the top.
Thus every fourth strand across the top is omitted. It is not
necessary to cut the strand; the wrapping is continuous. Repeat
