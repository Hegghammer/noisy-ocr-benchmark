No one doubts that a great forward m@vement is reaching its culminat-
ing point in the destiny of Asia. The \Wefffhas learnt its all of religion (the
moral and guiding principle of mankind) the East, and now the East
would fain learn the law of restraint at law of freedom (the protecting
principles of mankind) from the West, red by this feeling the lberal
Turks decidedly mean well, and the imated with a sincere desire to
ensure peace and security of life ang y for the heterogencous peoples
under the Turkish sway, but the ys have had to contend and still

To the Mahommedan worl Yycaliph of Islam is the envoy of
God, the sacredness of whose g WY inviolat Abdul Hamid, the
astute politician, knew that thq Vj, Y sovereignty depended on his
Caliphal rights, and his main Yaa, one period of his execrable
reign had been directed tow j nd asserting the same; thus

The Christian Arma Vurkey live in the midst of the followers
of a hostile religion, with wer or force behind them which makes for
protection. Who does ; ow that the great numerical preponderance of
Hinduism keeps the balg of power in India, and restrains bloody religious
hostilities; and when eview the whole religious history of Christian
Europe, and that terrilfong roll of crimes committed in the name of }lim
who expounded |lis rq@ifion with the parable of the Good Samaritan, and
the precept o! loving q's neighbour as one’s self, we cannot feel surprise at
the fanatical outburgf% of the followers of Mahommed, the founder of a
religion whose docffines certainly fall short of the humane principles
inculcaicd by the Founder of Christianity. If authentic historical facts prove
to us that horrible and atrocious cruelties have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other religionists, but on fellow Christians of different
denominations, how then can we expect better things from the Turk unless
some power or force restrain him ?

Christianity has now partly emancipated herself from the ferocities
which darkened and poured the red stream of blood on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at large, religion is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite.
