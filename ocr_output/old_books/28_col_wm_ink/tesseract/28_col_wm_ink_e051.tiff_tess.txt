THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE. 45
Fairies, and attendant ladies are described. Of two of the latter it
is said—
«“ Their kirtles were of rede cendel,* i
I laced smalle, jollyf, and well; i
There might none gayer go.”’
In the French version of the same poem it is, we read. more fully
expressed, It says, “They were richly habited and very tightly laced.”
The Lady Triamore is thus described :— |
“The lady was in a purple pall. |
With gentill bodye and middle smal}. |
Wharton quotes from an ancient goem, which he believes to date as
far back as 1200, in which a lovgf, speaking of the object of his
admiration, thus throws down the efMntct of challenge, and exclaims— :
“Middle her shofth mensk small.”
The word mensk or maint be ed instead of very or much. Some
differences of opinion have exi among writers as to the origin of the
word corset. Some are of in that the French words corps, the
body, and serrer (to t r incase), led to the adoption of
the term. |\iadame La r opinion, however, that it is
more probably 2 corruption © “ps, which was formerly
written cors, and may be ¥ of it. Another
iew oi the matter has b material called
corse, which was at one m the manufacture of
corsets, may have been his is scarcely probable, as
the word corset was in arly a period to admit of that origin.
Perhaps as early an } of the use of the term corset as any in
existence may be fowMid as a portion of an entry in the household register
of Eleanor, Countess of Leicester, which bears the date May 24, 1265 :—
* A rich description of silk.
