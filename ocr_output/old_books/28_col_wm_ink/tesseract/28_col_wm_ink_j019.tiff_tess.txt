CANING SUGGESTIONS

As weaving progresses difficulty will be experienced in inserting
cane ends in the holes, due to their begoming filled. Force the

force an opening. ,

In many instances long ends ¢ nain from one series to
another. These generally, as prey ioned, should be used
in succeeding steps. There ts n. They should be
used provided it is not necessar over more than four
holes on the under side of ¢ wer loose ends left,
the better, for the caning is etter. It is gener-
ally advisable to use a f void a number of
loose ends.

Study it carefully.

The addition of a binder is generally a matter of Ue. Perhaps
50 per cent of modern hand caned furniture does not employ a
binder of any description. The series of regularly exposed holes
are rather pleasing and in no way detract. However, in chair seats
a binder is essential to protect the ends of canes, for they are subject
to hard wear.

Binders of reed or of wood called “splines” may be used on hand-
caned frames. If either is used a groove % in. deep and 3/16 in.
