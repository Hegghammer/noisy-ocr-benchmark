CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
DESCRIPTION PLATES.

Tat ther ngrayines of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the progress Art, is to he regretied. The talents
of Mr. Joun Scorr, broug PIN, Cooppr, and the REINAGLEs,
have presented the public with ex the distinguished ts of the
turf: the sports of the field, and the ha he canine race, were also duly
honoured: but of the ferocious TiGER tribe, an be noting’ extant that
would bear critical inspection, beyond a few detachec lection of
figures, whose justness and accuracy of form, action, chaf¥pter, and

Does any reader imagine that the various Etchings whic) hay en performed—chiefly
abroad—by Artists of no mean ability, may be co od as excepons? They are not exceptions :
or at best, the number which might be so regarded is but small, alji those, for the most part, of
dimensions not accommodated to the drawer of the cabinet, or the self of the library.

But they are not objectionable on this ground alone. Speakingfof them in the agereeate, the

They have been taken {00 much on the credit which attaches to the grea\ names of their authors.
—Nor is this intended to impugn the merits, as historical or poetical paintdrs, of those distinguished
Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that as a painter of allegory, RubENs
might consider that strong infusion of /wman form, character, and expression, by which his Lions,
for exainple, are distinguished, as necessary, or conducive, to his allegorical purposes; or, it is pos-
sible that his knowledge of this animal may not have been thoroughly well-grounded, and that he

aay have laboured under early prejudice of mind, or of vision, in this part of his education as a
Painter, and may not have seen Lions as they really are. This is what the writer is most inclined
to believe, (though not to insist); for even in treating the subject of Daniel in the den of Lions—
