viii PREFACE
from Smith, who himself was prone to include
* the most extravagant myths in his pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE JIIstoRY OF
THE Lives AND Acrions oF THE Most Famous
HiguwayMen. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the “truth” of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better. ,

No one has ever reprinted those cuihors in
their original extravagance, or their grossness.
Tt would be impossible ; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever egg
them, or even written an in
the highwaymen. When w ish-
ingly popular those x, een
which have had Ch; Turpin,
and their like ff, not a little
surprisii,

Perhap been abandoned because
of the g me almost insuperable difficulty
—ofe Fict from fiction, and because of a

sense that it would be a thankless task

present the highwayman as he really was: a
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No novelist would
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dis-
service ; and I do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
