CANING SUGGESTIONS 21
is necessary before the weaver feels confident of readily caning any
area of odd shape.

In weaving the diagonals it is frequently necessary to run several
in one hole in order to keep the canes as straight as possible. Just
when this should be done can only be determined by the worker.
A diagonal should never be permitted to swing to any great degree
out of a straight line. A close observation of the photograph of

Five-Step Cafiing.—Cane weaving of five steps is not common.
It may be donf in many cases where it will not be subject to hard

step caning’ The presumption should not be made that this weave
will in any way supplant the regular weave, but in instances where
decoration is the object, and not service particularly, this weave
will prove sufficient and effective.

Fig. 12 illustrates a frame caned with the five steps. The dis-
tance between holes was purposely made greater than usual, to
show the weave clearly. The first strands are strung in, in the
same manner as described in the seven steps. The second series of
