CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. 3

Every artist does best, that which he is best qualified and best disposed to do. In com-
pleting the number of plates that has been found necessary for the Work, Mr. Epwirn LANDSEER
has chosen to proceed toward the same purpose, upon a different principle. He has gone, without
any introductory medium, directly to the living animals, and has exhibited the savage manners and
habits of these quadrupeds, according to his own ideas and observations.

’ On the distinction between CHARACTER and EXPRESSION, we shall now deliver our oping
By the Character of an animal, we mean those permanencies of his look and features why
always offers to view when in a placid, or unimpassioned state: by his Kapression, the,
of muscular action superinduced on character, to which he is liable, as the storms of

The former, seems to hold its court in the solid and massy parts: the ft
times rebelliously, the nerves and muscles. Character is ever present, b ‘oun-
tenance, and in the “human face divine.” The most violent expres nie, or

THE Character, and little Expression, in the reposing Leopard with his sheathed
claw: 1s shewn in t ent engraving, copied by Mr. Srizspury from Riprnern, and
¢ ed from Nature. RiprnGER was an artist of great power, who studied wild animals in
their sequestered haunts, as is shewn in his grand forest back-grounds ; and who, generally
speaking, left litle or no room for others to improve, except on some few of his inferior works.
The present is on imteresting and beautiful animal, yet there is a latent capability of mischief
characterised in his countenance, and we might ask, in the language of Job, “ Who shall dare to
rouse him up 2?”
