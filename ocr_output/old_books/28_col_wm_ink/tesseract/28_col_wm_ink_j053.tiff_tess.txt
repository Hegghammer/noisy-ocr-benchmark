caution used to avoid breaking strands.

Rectangular Seats.— As stated, in weaving a square seat the
initial process is repeated at all corners until all openings are filled.
In rectangular seats the spaces on the short rails will fll before

method of filling in the center just described. It supplements the
photograph and makes the method clearer.

It should be noted that the strands in crossing at the center must

grade boy. Fig. 45 shows the complete stool. ‘The seat is woven
