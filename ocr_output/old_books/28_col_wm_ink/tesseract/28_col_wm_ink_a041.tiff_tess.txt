like a round how, a great brown cye revealed the inward spirit’s intelligence and zeal un-
queneligd. On his head was a close-titting cap of purple velvet.

From his earliest yea of ‘Curkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round spirit of nationality—such a
spirit as only kindles in opp? isygoing tolerance among the
prosperous and contented of t wandering far and wide through
the Turkish, Persian, and Russ ine Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by d glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after ted himself to the building of schools,
which he generously threw open t 'y assassins of Armenians. For many
years, while Europe was occupied wi ‘Austrian wars, or French and German
wars, we see him eeaselessly journeyil n to Constantinople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, t inually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred cinhi he Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenian patriarch Jonstantinople (1869), he was driven from
his oflice after four years.

But the cup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitiless slaughter of Bulgarians and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armics to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to pl his people’s cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Europe
heforchand, urg hem to create un autonomous neutral state for Armenia, as they had
tone with success tor the Lebanon. In London be became acquainted with Gladstone ; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and,
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing fer his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey’s definite reforms. Jt is necdless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London amid shouts of “ Peace with Honor,”
and Armenia was left to stew.

So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, le
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incaleulable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake
