Glance down no ger om™mhe ocean foam,
Lest Thou behg h Hors as can turn
Men’s burning tq@ame, and chill their soul
Keep Thine d full of charity
That Tho ble to forgive,
And pity | » know not when
To pausg , s sacrifice
Restra Keep Thine hand in
Smi ely (st without the pale
Thg Gare to Siw the ocean waste
W eatures, infcent of wrong.
he studied purpodge to destroy;
Aunching of the missile through the deep;
e shattered hull; the crushed and bleeding forms;
he seething swirl of wreckage, women, men.
