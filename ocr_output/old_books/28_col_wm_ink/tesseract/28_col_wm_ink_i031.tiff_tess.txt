THE LUSITANIA’S LAST VOYAGE
I mean those in the staterooms. I cannot
spegk with certainty in regard to the port-
h on deck E. I believe that the first list
t ip took brou er down to these
orts on d side and that
y from filling
elt that the
ie any mo-

‘hing more that -

could be d !e—ior there was
no discipli hich to do it—I
passed thro rd side. Men
were sirivin, boats and were
putting wom: to them, but it
seemed to me tha ded horror to
the whole situation t eople into a
boat that you knew never Id be cleared
and which would go down with the steamer;
better leave them on the deck to let them

take their chance at a piece of wreckage.
