rocky cavern—his animals partake of the artificial character of which we cannot bring ourselves to

Of this fact, however, we purpose to exhibit proof with our assertion. Improved versions, to
the best abilities of our Artists, of some of these Lions of RupEns and the Assyrian king, will here
be introduced, which the reader, who pleases, may compare with the originals. Our second, third,

felt at liberty to form on the subject, we feel at liberty to utter. So much in apology for using the
licence of asserting that the heads of many of the Lions of Runmns rather resemble those of frowning
