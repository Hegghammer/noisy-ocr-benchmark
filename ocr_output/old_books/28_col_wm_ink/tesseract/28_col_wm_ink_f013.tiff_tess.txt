PREFACE ix
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we believed in when schoolboys.  Seientifie his-
torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and exalted the villains, for whom of old no
mud was too thick and slab. Beliefs are being
assailed on every side. To abolish the traditional
j courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the considerate
conduct of Captain ITind would, therefore, be
strokes of the unkindest, and I have herve uttempied
no such noclasm. Hven where I cannot be-
lieve, I hav ld the tale—whenever it has been
worth the tell? as it is found in criminal
trials, or in Sm r Johnson, and other old
sources, decorously § rd of much vile language.
For » that seems ineredible
may be where the believable
turns out 20 *tis your only way.
To contin ighwaymen from
Smith and Johrso roaching end
f all such things im the nine-
teenth century, is like takv cluding
a half-told tale. But it was doing.
Only in respect of the great figure a has
always made, has it been found really TM@essary
to seriously consider and re-state the career of
that much-overrated scoundrel, and to put him
in his proper place: a very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
