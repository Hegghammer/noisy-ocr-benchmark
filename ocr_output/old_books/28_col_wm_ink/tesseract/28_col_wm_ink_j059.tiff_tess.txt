CHAPTER VI
REED AND SPLINT WEAVING
Reeds which are used extensively for basket-making and weav,
in general are procured from the species of palm described ing
ter I. These reeds should not be confused with the
applied to several distinct species of large water !g Ps.
Such reeds are usually designated under the name ere
are a thousand species of palm distgj Bions
of the entire world p Htates
and these are of no distinct commercial val
palms of India and the Malay [slands if ts
and are imported into this country in / rat-
tans and the trailing palm of the specfff main
export centers Singapore and Calcutta. J stripped
of leaves and bark and split into roundZ Bt different
diameters and widths. The outer bark? fi into proper
sizes, is known as chair cane; the entire# eaves removed,
is commercially known as rattan; and J â€œis are frequently
sold as flat rattan and pith cane. Inasrg ese flat and round
strips, split from the palm plant and g Hd under the name of
rattan are called reeds, we shall refer #gem under that name in
all discussions to follow. There are t@@ qualities of reed on the
market sold under the names of China #ed and German reed. The
former is inferior in quality and the latter is superior, being strong,
tough and durable. The Philippine Islands give promise of pro-
ducing a liberal supply of reed of good quality that is claimed to
equal the German product. The problem, however, is one of gath-
ering and marketing the product. The government has made a
partial survey of the rattan supply, and this justifies the belief that
the Islands will eventually compete with the world market.
