4 hours. Remove it from the tub and wash thoroly in running
water, The best way to do this is to lay the reed on an inclined
surface and turn a forceful stream of water upon it. Chloride of
lime has a bad effect upon the hands in that it makes them sore and
tender, so care must be taken to properly rinse the reed. A little
tallow rubbed over the hands will materially offset the tendency to
tenderness, and generally keep them in good condition

Staining.— Bleached reed takes stain much more readily and
evenly than does the natural or unbleached. {t may cained any
color with prepareg stains, but ordinarily these leave the reed

or wiping off in the recesses which weaving leaves. Per-
haps the bes coloring reed, and at least a very desirable
one, espec} keen woven, is naptha. The preparation
of the ; ss of coloring is as follows: Obtain the

Coiled hanks of reed may be immersed in the solution, immedi-
ately withdrawn and hung to drain dry above the receptacle, thus
permitting surplus stain to drain back into it. The stain may be
used repeatedly, and as it is very volatile it should be kept in a
tightly corked red can when not in use. It is also highly inflam-
