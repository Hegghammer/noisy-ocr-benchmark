DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE.
Ihave thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested witnesses.

“Weare haying a perfectly hideous time here. Thousands have been murdered—25,00
in this provinee they say ; but the number is probably greater, for every Christian village
was wiped out In Adana about 5000 have perished. After Turks and Armenians 1
made peace, the Turks eame in the night with hose and kerosene. and set fire to what remained
of the Armenian quarter. Next day the French and Armenian schools were fired. Nearly evory-
one in the Armenian school perished, anybody trying to eseape being shot down yy thesoldiers.”

“he Turkish Authorities do nothing except arrest unoffending Armenians, from whon
by torture they extort the most fanciful confessions. yen the wounded are not safe from
their injustice. .A man was being carried in to me yesterday when he was scized and taken
off to gaol. I dare not think what his fate may be.

‘“‘ Por fiends incarnate commend me to the ‘Turks. Nobody is safe from them. They
murder babies in front of their mothers ; they half murder men, and violate the wives while
the husbands are lying there dying in pools of blood.”

“The authorities did nothing, and the soldiers were rse than the crowd P
better armed. One house in our quarter was burned with 115 peoples 1
the bodies. The soldiers set fire to the door, and as the Vv
could get out, Everybody in the house was 2g ad
children and old people.” —Extract from |e sul

IN THIS HOUSE 115 WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ROASTED ALIVE.
llistory repeats itself. In 1895 Turkish soldiers fell upon seventy to eighty young
women and girls in a church, where they had fled for refuge, and after hidcously outraging
them, barricaded them in, setting fire to the building at the same time, and derisively shouting
to their victims as they were being roasted alive, to call upon their Christ to save them now
