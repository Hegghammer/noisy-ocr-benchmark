Researc i, one of rious forest cities |

to light most a now forgotten

At the period of the discovery of som he islands of the
Eastern Archipelago, it was found customary forS@l young females to
wear a peculiar kind ot corset, formed of spirally-arranged rattan
cane, and this, wien once put on, was not removed until the celebration
of the marriage ceremony. Such races as were slowly advancing in the
march of civilisation, after discovery by the early navigators, became
more and more accustomed to the use of clothing, to adjust and retain :
which, waistbands would become essentially requisite. ‘These, when
mace sufficiently broad to fit without undue friction, and stiff enough to
prevent folding together in the act of stooping, sitting, or moving
about, at once became in effect corsets, and suggested to the minds
of the ingenious a system of cutting and fitting so as more perfectly to
adapt them to the figure of the wearer. The modes of fastening, as
we shall see, have been various, from the simple sewing together with
the lace to the costly buckle and jewelled loop and stud.
