Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and rown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another n which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for then ye been exempt ; this super-added evil, is, the
large neigbouring bo nd Circassians, greater marauders and
depredators than the 7 ccupation of whose lives comprise:
murder and robbery, and veary centuries unremittingly
quartered themselves upon . easants, and lived ot
the fruits of their labour and t nidieh cavalry wa
was established expressly for com
these Kurds, it ought to be matte tl
trained and practised in organized n
which they were encouraged and
régime.

Under all such conditions no hope of ry
no prospect of better times seems possible, fo €
Armenian race whom force of circumstances ne
fatherland.

The appointment of Christian governors oO in-
habited by them might ameliorate some of the evils, o ve,
of allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespe or
nationality, would furnish some means of self-defence aids
and barbarities of the oppressors; but even if such concessio ted,
life for the christian peasant subject to Turkish rule, and livir nidst
of his enemies, must remain one long struggle and battle agai age,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Notthei ertile
soil, not the most javourable climatic conditions, not the most uous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, can bringWo the
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
happiness, and security of life and property, which the law of all civilized
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil.
