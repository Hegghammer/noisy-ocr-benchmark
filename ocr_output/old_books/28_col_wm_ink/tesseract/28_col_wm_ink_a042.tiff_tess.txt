Van, and the lowest estimate counted the murdered dead at 109,009, Gladstone madez the
last great speech of his heroic life. England attempted some kind of protest. But rather
than join the Liberal demand for action, Lord Rosebery left his party for private leisure, and
Russia, France, und Germany combined to secure immunity for the “great assassin.” It
Was the lowest point of ISurope’s shame.

Blow followed blow, Hardly had the remnant of the Armenian people cscaped
massaere when their Chureh fell under the brutal domination of Russia. Plchve ordained its
destruction, and Golitzin was sent to Tiflis as governor-general to carry it out. Church
propert malic of £6,000,000 was seized by violence, the Katholikos resolutely refusing
to give mete where the title deeds were kept (June, 1903). For two years

Some of the bishops and monks, who form a couneil round their elief, still look for
Europe’s interference, and trust that the solemn pledges taken by England and other Powers
at Berlin may be tulfilled. e Bishop of Evivan, for instance, still labors for the appoint-
ment of a Christian governor over the district marked by the il]-omened names of Van, Bitlis,
and Erzerown. J also found that even among the Georgians there was a large party willing
to concede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian villages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Cancasus wins federal
autonomy, 3 a majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
cforts to education and industries. One cannot yet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolutionary parties of ‘The Bell” and “The Flag.” Of these,
the Social Democratic “ Bell ” follows the usual impracticable and pedantic creed of St. Mars.
The “Flag,” or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a great
assembly held in Erivan last August (1906) they adopted a programme of land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected laymen. Jf the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the couutry are set.

Whatever may be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, ¥ think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
