PREFACE.
————

Tue subject which we have here treated is a soyfof ‘igurative
battle-field, where fierce contests have for ages bee in time to time
waged; and, notwithstanding the determincd assa@s of the attack
hosts, the contention and its cause remain pretty fh as they yy a
commencement of the war. We in the me rem eutral,

merely performing the part of the public’ t,” making
it our duty to gather together such oy s, both ancient
and modern, as may prove interg take note of the
vicissitudes of war, mark it , in fine, to do our best
to lay clearly before g d cal facts—experiences and
arguments —rela the “ Corset question.”

As mos our reac re, the leading journals especially
intended for the peru have been for many years the media
for. the exchange off number of letters and papers touching
the use of the The questions relating to the history of
this apparently MPpensable article of ladies’ attire, its construction,
application, anggmitluence on the figure have become so numerous of late
that we havéthought, by embodying all that we can glean and garner
relating to Corsets, their wearers, and the various costumes worn by
ladies at different periods, arranging the subject-matter in its due order
as to dates, and at the same time availing ourselves of careful illustration
when needed, that an interesting volume would result. |
