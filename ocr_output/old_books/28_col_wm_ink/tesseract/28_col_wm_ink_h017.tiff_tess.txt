PREFACE—INTRODUCTION.
We give Barnabas Horron as the Preface and Introduction to this
little volume of Chronicles. He was probably the son of Josep
Horton, of Leicestershire, England, and born in the little hamlet o
Mousely of that shire. Of his history before he came to America very
little is known. He came over in the ship ‘‘ Swa//ow,’’ in 1633-38.
He landed at Hampton, Mass. How long he remained at !Tampton

to settle on the east cad of Long Island. See Griffin's Journal.
Barnabas Horton was a man of deep-toned piety, and a warm advo-
cate of civil and religious freedom. He was one of the most promi-
nent and influential men of-Southold. He was for many years a
magistrate, and several times a member of the General Court at New
Haven and Harford. He built the first framed dwelling-house ever
erected on the east of Long Island, and that house is still (1875)
standing and occupied. It is a shingle-house, that is, shingles are
used for weather-boards, and the sides have never been reshingled,
and the roof but once, according to the statement of Jonathan Gold:
smith Horton, the last Horton occupant of the old house.
