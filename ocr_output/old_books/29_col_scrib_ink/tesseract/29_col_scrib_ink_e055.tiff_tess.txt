THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE. 49
having only her kirtle upon her back. John Gower, howevér )
wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus desc company ‘of
ladies. They were, says he, “clothed all alike, in kirtles with capes
or mantl4syparti-coloured, white, and blue, embroidered all with
yarious devicex.” ‘Their bodies are described as being lon all,
and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though
had been a queen. We find that the tight-laced young e
court of the Lady Triamore_‘ had_mantles Q yet, .
handsomely bordered with gold, and Jined with mech furs. eads |
were neatly Attired in kerchiefs, and were ornamented with cut work and
richly-striped wires of gold, and upon their kerchiefs they had each of
them a pretty coronal, embellished with sixty gems or more ;” and of
| their pretty mistress it is said in the same poem, that her cheeks were as
red as the rose when it first blossoms. Her hair shone upon her head
like golden wire, falling Beneath xctown Of Bord Nich) Cinamented with
precious stones. Her vesture was purple, and her mantle, lined with white
rmine, was also elegantly furred with the same. ‘The Princess Blanche,
the daughter of Edward-III., the subject of the annexed illustration,
appears to have copied closely the dress above described, and, like the
maids of honour of the Lady Triamore herself, she is not onlyyichly
habited but thoroughly well-laced as well. ‘Thus we see, in yfar
1361, the full influence of the corset on the costume of that pefidd. /:
‘There is another poem, said to be more sien even Launfal, i
which, no doubt, ‘served to give a tone and direct © the fashicns of
times following after. Here we find a beautiful lady described as
wearing a splendid girdle of beaten gold, embellished with rubies and
emeralds, about her middle small. ONAN
i describing a lover who is in the act of admiring
his mistrese%f thus writes:— —-
* He seeth hir shape forthwith, all |
Hir bodye round, hir middle small.”
