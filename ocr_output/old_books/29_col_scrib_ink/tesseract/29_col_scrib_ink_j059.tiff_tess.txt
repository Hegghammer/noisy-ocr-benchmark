CHAPTER VI
| REED AND fPLINT WEAVING
Reeds which are used extqlsively for basket-making and weaving, Lv
in general are procured frog the species of palm described in Chap-
. These reeds sho not be confused with the term reed
to several disti species of large water loving grasses.
e usually AMfgnated under the name of grasses. There
ecie palm distributed over the tropical regions
nly a few are native in the United States,
t commercial value. The rattan or cane
, Islands grow to an unusual height,
; in great quantities. "These rat-
e species Calamus have as main
alcutta. These palms are stripped
into round and flat strips of different
er bark, when stripped into proper
tire palm, with leaves removed,
e rattan; and the flat reeds are frequently
and pith cane. Inasmuch as these flat and round
om the palm plant and exported under the name of
alled reeds, we shall refer to them under that name in we
ssions to follow. /Tbere are two qualities of reed on the
t sold under hep Chin reed and German reed. The
mer is inferior in qfalityand the latter is superior, being strong,
ough and durable. The Philippine Islands give promise of pro-
ducing a liberal supply of reed of good quality that is claimed to
equal the German product. The problem, however, is one of gath-
ering and marketing the product. The government has made a
partial survey of the rattan supply, and this justifies the belief that
the Islands will eventually compete with the world market.
