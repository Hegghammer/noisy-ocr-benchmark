CANING; THE SEVEN STEPS 18

open squares are thus formed over the area being caned. Unless
‘the cane is soaked it will prove rather difficult to pair the canes.
~ Step 5. This step is the weaving of one set of diagonals. Start

Step 6. This step is ical with the preceding one. The canes~ ~*~
are at right angles t@iMfig first diagonals. In this step and the
preceding one note @@tfwo strands run into the corner holes.
This holds true in rectangular frames where a corner hole is
bored. It permitsfthe strands to run in as straight a line as pos-_
sible. If it is necessary to turn abruptly to enter a hole it is obvious
that an error has been made by the weaver.

Step 7. Pull a cane of the same size as used in the other steps up
thru a hole, over the binder cane and down thru the same hole.
A loop is thus formed and the binder secured. Pull taut, then
