SEATS OF REEDS AND SPLINTS

in the main, to stools or seats. Fig. 53 shows several stools different

C y- design both in wood construction and in weaving. In two in-
“amces it will be noted that weaving is done over_a separate frame,
one being inserted between the rails, the other fastened on top,
Jeaving a little projection. Reference is m several possible
weaving designs and the use of various ip ations,

designs of varying complexity may be worked out. An e t
method for working out possible designs is that of using black
white paper strips 14 in. in width. The design will show up ve
clearly beeause of_the contrast of the black and white. Experi-
menting with the weave on the seat itself is rather tedious and
unsatisfactory. “The paper strips are an excellent means to an end.

The stool top illustrated in Fig. 54 employs a simple over-and-
under weave, utilizing flat reed. The worker needs to decide at
the outset on the character of weave to be used unless it be oh now
unusual design. In this instance the weaver runs over three and
under three strands, andpeh€ wrapping done in a series of three.
To begin the operatiop’tack an end of flat reed under a short rail
at a corner, then bring the strand out and over the rail, across the
frame opening to the opposite rail, under this rail, across under-.
neath the frame opening to the bottom of the first rail. This com-
pletes the process once around. Repeat three times; then wrap the
strand around the two rails, without running it across the top.
Thus every fourth strand across the top is omitted. It is not
necessary to cut the strand; the wrapping is continuous. Repeat
