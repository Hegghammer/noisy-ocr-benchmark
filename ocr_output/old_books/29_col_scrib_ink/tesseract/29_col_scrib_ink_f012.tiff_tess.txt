viii PREFACE
from Smith, who himself was prone to include :
* the most extravagant myths in his pages, ea
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE IJlIstorY OF
THE pee” Acrions oF THE Most Famous
Hicuwkyytn. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the “truth” of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better. ;
No one has ever reprinted those authors in
themeriginnt’ extravagance, or their grossness.
Tt would be impossible ; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
| them, or even written an independent history of
onsider how astonish-
mances have ever been
¢ / Ww nde Du Pall, and Turpin,
and + heroes, this is not a little
surpris
Perh he task has been abandoned because
of the difficulity—the almost insuperable difficulty (])
—of sifting fact from fiction, and because a ‘
chittling ~sense that it would be a tantly
to present the highwayman as he really was: a
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No HOvélist—tontd
be likely ce the frank historian for this dis-
service ; And do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
