Tue subject which we have here treated is a sort of figurative
battle-field, where fierce contests have for ages been from time to time
waged; and, notwithstanding the determined assaults of the attacking
hosts, the contention and its cause remain pretty much as they were at the
commencement of the war. We in the matter remain strictly neutral,

| merely performing the part of the public’s “ own correspondent,” making
it our duty to gather togethe h extxacts from despatches, both ancient
ond modern, as may prove interesti MA wetant, to take note of the
AN es of war, mark its ill pg, to do our best
