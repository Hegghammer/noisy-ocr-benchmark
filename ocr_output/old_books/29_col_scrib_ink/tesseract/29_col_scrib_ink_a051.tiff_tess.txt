Qn the field the ever victorious army of little Japan undermined Russia’s
strongheld, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
defeated Spd ever retreating army of colossal Russia. At sea th cr
victorious Jayanese [leet succeeded in completely annihilating: ssian
Ileet. It wasNyar such as the world had never yt 7 The secret of
such astounding s\<cesses should be investigated, here I beg leave to
quote from yope of series of articles in which I gave view to my opinions
during hu e War. ‘Japan may be likened to the bundle of
faggots in able firmlyNjed together ; one faggot of larger dimensions in
the centre, the sovereign r€qod whom the whole nation clusters, and all,
ruler and people tied together Ny adamantine bands of patriotism.”

These remarks of mine were%gased on observations of actual facts. In
national unity Japan stands as an oMgcet lesson to the world; she furnishes
an exateplerwitelnthe world needs to CM, and which a nation so politically
forlorn as ourselves more than any other®@geds to copy.

From the astounding success of Japag urn to the postiohhe
Great Republic of the United States 9 Bee in the world, ‘and
take the lesson to heart of what Uny eotrast their
present position with the position t meecupied
when they first landed of7Antegd Bciidred years ago.

National Unity is our greateé which we must
raise up over our national life. National™S ven on the
tablets of our minds_and_throb in the pulses Bhere are
mountains of difficiiliies before us, and if ever we mus pal we
can only do so by being bound together like the bundle of TSS the
fable, with no weakening or loosening of the bands. Then/feriaS
might once more be able to get an independent footing on th¢ hjstorical-soms
of our fathers, and perhaps once more rally round our own flag Japan- /
ese_lives for the State, not for himself; we have ate for which to Ge, -
but let us livéfor our communities whilst we ae hope in our hearts
that communities grow into States.

We have grit and endurance in an unparalleled degree, but thes
characteristics will profit us nothing if weacenvanting-nunity.

Let us rem T that utterance of the Founder of our faith. In \u
loyalty and a|éfiance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents o
cataract, bu%wemfust remember His warning utterance :—

“What shall it profit a man.” What shall it profit a nation. Unity is
the soul of a nation. Let us keep our soul and not lose it.
