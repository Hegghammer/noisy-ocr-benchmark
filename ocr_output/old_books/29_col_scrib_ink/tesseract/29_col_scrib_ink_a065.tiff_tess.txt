Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Enypsre
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this super-added_ evil gi\ ane
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, ggeater ers and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation e lives comprises
murder and rgbbery, and who have through weary tenturies unremittingly
quartered ves upon the industrioys christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits df theiflabour and toil. Ind as the Hamidieh cavalry which
was establi expressly for tne E kin massacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter tion what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organize a now find for those habits in
which they were encouraged indulge by the Hamidian
r√©gime,

Under all such conditi ays can be forthcoming
no prospect of better tim unhappy portion 1e
Armenian race whom ps on the soil o\/the

The appointn hristian governors over the provinces in-
habited by them might amelosreseamcalthawnisocthowsher alternative,
fe allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespective of creed or
ationality, would furnish some means of selfdefence against the raids
barbarities of the oppressors; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christian_peasaat subject to Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his enemies, must remain one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Not the most fertile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the n siduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, Lis eS
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of thdt tom /
happiness, and security of life and property, Gi law of all civitzed -
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer ahd tHler of the soil.
