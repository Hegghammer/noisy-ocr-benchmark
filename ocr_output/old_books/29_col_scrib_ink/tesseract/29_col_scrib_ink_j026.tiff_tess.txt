The Design Element.—Caning is@pt a fad. Cane was comm Uer—ere

monly used in Carolean furniture in Ert§land about 1660, and has
continued in use for seatipe~purposes thru the various subsequent
periods. The applicatigg/ol.cane as used today on French furniture,
as in panels, is historically wrong. However there can be no valid
objection to its use in panels if no attempt is made to name it a
true period style. Also it must be conceded that period furniture
was not always well designed, and there can be no well sustained
objection to the use of cane in panels, provided it is in keeping
structurally and decoratively with the particular piece of furniture.
