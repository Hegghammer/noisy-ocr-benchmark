PREFACE ix
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions -
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific higew
torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and aytyi villains, for whom of old no
mud wa thick and slab. Beliefs are being
assailed on every side. To abolish the traditional
j courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the consider
conduct of Captain Lind would, there
strokes of NE Mnktindest, and I have here
no such iconoclasm, Even where
lieve, I have told the tale—uwhe
| worth the tellingy—as it is @
trials, or in Smith og
sources, decorously stripped o
Tur really, where much
may be fully proped—anc
turns out not rarely to be false, ’tis 4
To continue the story of the highwaymei
Smith and Johnson down to the approaching en (])
of all such things in the beginning of the yame-
teenth century, is like taking up and conciheg)
a half-told tale. But tw was worth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpin has
always made, has it been found really necessary
to srl ore and re-state the career of
that much-overrated scoundrel, and to put him
in his proper place: a very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
