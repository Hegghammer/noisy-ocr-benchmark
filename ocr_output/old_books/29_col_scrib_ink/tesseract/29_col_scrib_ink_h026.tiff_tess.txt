XIV Preface.—Introduction,

This book is mainly what those who have kindly furnished records
and sketches have made it. The whole has been carefully compiled.
But genealogical works, almost of necessity, contain many errors. -
Doubtless this small work has its full share. But when errg)s ars A
covered, notice thereof should be given, so that a second egftion may
be made eptirely truthful. Thankful to all who have generously given
their asfigétitye, this work is sent out as a small contribupion to the
genealbgical Aiterature of the day, and in the hope thaf%/a more full
and extenSive book of Horton chronicles may be igf#fed at no very
distant day.

Terrytown, 10 Jan., 1876.
