PREFACE
from Smith, who himself was prone to include
the most extraragant myths in his pages, calls
Barcine
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE LIXES AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAMOUS
HIGHWAYMEN. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the "truth" of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.
No one has ever reprinted those wuthors in
then extravagance, or their grossness.
It would be impossible; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
them, or even written an independent history of
consider how astonish-
mances have ever been
wh
ride Du Vall, and Turpin,
and
heroes, this is not a little
surprist
Perhar the task has been abandoned because
of the difficulty-the almost insuperable difficulty
N.
-of sifting fact from fiction, and because of a
chatling sense that it would be a thankless task
to present the highwayman as he really was : a
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No morrist would
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dis-
service ; and I do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
