occasionally amuses himself in hunting and fishing. His integrity,
industry and great business capacities, during the active part of his
life, rendered him a most valuable acquisition to the community in

September, 1806. My parents were farmers, in modera
stances. I remained with them until I was seventeen, WF
farm in the summer, and going to school in the winter
merely a common-school education. When I was
at the suggestion of my parents, I decided to
trade, and commenced the business at once
ticeship for several years. On the I7th of
Phebe Tompkins, and on the 9th of Max

perty, and set up the blacksmithing bus
business. In the spring

Z

implements, principally ploughs and plough-cast
increased rapidly, and paid us well. We contino
twenty years. In 1855 Mr. Minor retired from busine
in Mr. Geo. W. Depeu as a partner, and about 1wo years
we admitted each of us a son, and the firm then became,
Depeu & Sons. Our manufactured articles were sold in nearly
State in the Union, and also in many foreign countries.
" In 1862 we all sold out to a stock company, formed 191 that pur
pose. Having been in active business for thirty years, noy retired.
In the spring of 1855 I was elected Supervisor of the town of Cort-
landt, and I represented that town in the Board of Supervisors for five
years in succession.
" In the winter of 1858, I was a from
this Assembly district. For many years I held the various offices of
our village, but of late have declined official stations, preferring the
enjoyments of private life."
Mr. Horton is not a public professor of Christianity, but is a gen-
tleman of correct moral deportment, and very temperate in his habits.
