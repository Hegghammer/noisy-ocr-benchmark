Some of the bishops and monks, who form a council round their ehief, still look for
Europe's interference, and trust that the solemn pledges taken by England and other Powers

Whatever may be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
