and genealogy of the early settlers of Southold-examining all the deeds and wills,
and other authentic documents to be found, and also copying the inscriptions from
every headstone, not only in Southold, but over nearly the whole Island-makes
it
very evident that some of those named were not there at so early a date, and he
also says that Peter Hallock, who is named as one of the thirteen, was the grandson
of the Puritan Hallock who settled at Southold, and whose Christian name was
William. Mr. Moore is one of the best genealogists of the country, and in relation
to Long Island, he is the best authority extant.
MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE.
It will be seen by the engraving that the old house is double. The
western part is that which was built by Barnabas in 1659-60. The
east or two
by Jonathan I., about 1682. The upper
room of this part was used for a court-house for nearly twenty years,
as we learn from Thompson's History of Long Island, and some of
the old benches used when it was a court-house are still preserved.
The old "castle," as Jonathan G. Horton, its last Horton occupant,
used to call it, is in all probability the old
Juse in America.
I know of no dwelling-house

revious to 1640-two or

thr
dement in Southold, soon all

of the first generation buildings
can be found
lined for the house that Barnabas
built to survive
d
to stand to-day as a noble
representative of the
dred and fifteen years ago.

But the old house sta
peering above all others
by its age, but also occupanc
very often that wefurd
two generations of same name, living
in the same house
rarely find three But here we have six gener
in succession, all
bearing the Hoton name, living and dying in the
me house, and
all born in it'except Barnabas I., and his son Jonathan. We may go
to the castles and palaces of the old world, and search long and dili-
gently, and fail to find parallel case.
With a few repairs, the old castle may yet stand for generations far
in the future.
It requires some thought and reflection to realize the lapse of time
since the old house was built. See the old Puritan himself there
twenty years ; then his son Jonathan, twenty-eight years ; and then
Jonathan, Jr., about sixty years; and next Lawrence and his son Jona-
