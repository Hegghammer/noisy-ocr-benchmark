THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
I
went in and stood on the floor of our house my
heart was thumping within me at the thought of
what was before.
And there was the pot boiling over the fire with
a few green herbs in it. There was Saba, my
mother, stirring the last handful of meal amongst
the green herbs. And there were my brothers,
all older than I, sitting by the fire, waiting for
the herbs and the meal to be ready,
she
saw the
Z
man from the Stra
that
some crime had been co
father
to bring a man of su
mongst us.
She and my brotherg
afraid, for they
were poor, and th
re high were harsh
to them. But t]
or spoke softly, saying,
"Good fortune
ome to you from the sea
to-day." And
cn they all turned toward him
he
said,
"I
O am very knowledgeable will take
your son with me as an apprentice,
instruct him in arts and crafts and mysteries."
My mother said, "The boy is young, sir, and we
thought he would be with us for a time longer."
