PREFACE
ix
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific his
fascine
torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and exalted the villains, for whom of old no
mud was tos thick and slab. Beliefs are being
assailed on every side. To abolish the traditional
courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the consider
conduct of Captain Hind would, theref
strokes of the unnindest, and I have here
no such iconoclasm. Even where
lieve, I have told the tale-when
worth the telling-as it is
f
trials, or in Smith onder
sources, decorously stripped of
For really, where much
may be fully proved, and
turns out not rarely to be false, 'tis you
To continue the story of the lighwaymen
Smith und Johnson down to the approaching end
N.
of all such things in the beginning of the nine-
teenth century, is like taking up and concla dim
a half-told tale. But it was worth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpin has
always maile, has it been found really necessary
to seriously foonsider and re-state the career of
that much-overrated scoundrel, and to put him
in his proper place : a very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
