I will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and relate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
1796 after ruling over Armenia fifty-eight years.
He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his dominionis, and
ting
grew to be so mighty in battle that the neighbon Tring nations called his
country Aramia and the people were called Armians, such names as
Armenia or Armenians being no doubt later corruptions.
The first victory of Aram was over Neuchar king of Media, whom he
took prisoker and put to death, and made a large part of the country of the
defeated prince tributary to his own. The second victory of Aram was over
Barsham king of Babylon, whom also he took prisoner and put to death.
The next victory was over the king of Cappadocia ; the army of the
Cappadocians was pursued to the very shores of the Mediterranean, and the
wholenof
fell into the hands of Aram B.C. 1796. Also Ninus
king of Assyria, at one time an eager enemy, awed by the victories of Aram,

Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when he includes
Northern Mesopotamia, together with the monnamous country of Ararat,
under the nante of Armenia, and in writing of the Armenian boats hat
brought merchandise to Babylon, he remarks that they were constructed m
Armenia, in the parts above Assyria.
Archœeological researches have laid the claim that the modern Armenians
are the descendants of the old Hittites ; the modern Armenian being supposed
