Practically the entire emphasis is laid upon weaving as applied
to some form of seat, either as a decorative feature or as a necessary
part of the structure. These materials may be utilized in various
|

of which are suggi ted. Experience with them will lead the worker
to new and interest T fields of a distinctly educational nature.
