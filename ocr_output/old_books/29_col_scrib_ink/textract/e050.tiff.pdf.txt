THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.
British Museum bears on it the strange and anomalous figura vepresented
inating
in the annexed illustration. Opinions vary somewnat as to whether
la
its origin might not have been Italian, but we see no reason for adopting
this view, and consider it as of decidedly home production. It will be
seen that the shoulder, upper part of the arm, and figure are those of a
well-formed female, who wears an unmistakable corset, tigh
laced, and
stiffened by two busks in front, from one of which the la

period show by their contour that the corset was worn
drapery, and Strutt, whose work was published in 1796, thus writes
the customs relating to dress in the period following shortly
the thirteenth century, and probably much prior to that period, a long
and slender waist was considered by our ancestors as a criterion of
elegance in the female form. We ought not, therefore, to wonder if it
be proved that the tight lacing and compressing of the body was
practised by the ladies even in early times, and especially by such
of them as were inclined to be corpulent." He then, in order to
show at vhat an early date of the history of this country a confirmed
