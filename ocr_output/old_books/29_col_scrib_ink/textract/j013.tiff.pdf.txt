Draw pencil lines entirdly around the inner sides of the rails and
stiles, 1/2 in. from the euges. This distance remains constant,
usually, on all areas and with canes the various widths. With a
pair of dividers set at 1/2 in. space off points on the pencil lines,
starting from the intersection of the extended lines on each rail.
