CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS
DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.
THAT there has hitherto existed no grood book of Engravings of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the progress of the student in that department of Art, is to be regretted. The talents
of Mr. JOHN SCOTT, brought into action by those of GILPIN, COOPER, and the REINAGLES,
have presented the public with excellent representations of the distinguished ornaments of the
turf: the sports of the field, and the habits and manners of the canine race, were also duly
honoured: but of the ferocious TIGER tribe, and the lordly LION, * have nothing extant that
