Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empite
fortunately for themselves have been exempt this super-added the
cridging
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, greater marauders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation whose lives comprises
murder and robbery, and who have through weary centuries unremittingly
quartered themsolves upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits di their labour and toil. Ind as the Hamidieh cavalry which
was established expressly for the H
an massacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter
tion what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized
n now find for those habits in
which they were encouraged
o
indulge by the Hamidian
régime.
Under all such conditio
days can be forthcoming
no prospect of better time
unhappy portion of the
Armenian race whom
reeps on the soil O1 the
fatherland.
The appointing
of Christian governors over the provinces in-
habited by them might alternative,
of allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespective of creed or
nationality, would furnish some means of self-defence against the raids
and barbarities of the oppressors ; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christian peasant subject to Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his enemies, must remain one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Not the most fertile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the nost assiduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, can bring to the
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
BB
happiness, and security of life and property, which/ law of all civilized
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer an d the of the soil.
