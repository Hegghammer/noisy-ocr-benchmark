Proface.-Introduction
It is said that Barnabas Horton I. was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities.
His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide.
placed horizontally over the grave. Thelstoned
informition
was re-lettered al
ixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It is elevated adoi
m the ground, on a good stone
base. The ofigin
had all crumbled down
many years ago
the stone at the
time it was re-lettered
The inscription sur
follows:
"Here lieth buried the bod
Mousely Lercestersnite, Old Ei
day of
July, 1680, aged 8o years."
In the centre of the stone
Itaph, as follows :
-

It is said that this epit h was written by himself, and that it, to- -
gether with the inscriptio date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the original
thirteen who brought his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and memory
should not perish from the earth.
