far
Avert Thy gaze
Glancaderan
Lest Thou behol
Men's burning h
buls.
Keep Thine heart
rity
That Thou mayst
give,
And I ty feel for
t
not when
Z
To pi in de
sacrifice.
Rest
Thy
nd keep Thine hand in
check;
Smite not, nor fiercely thrust without the pale
Those who can dare to strew the ocean waste
With fellow creatures, innocent of wrong.
Forget the studied purpose to destroy;
The launching of the missile through the deep;
Theshattered hull; the crushed and bleeding forms;
The seething swirl of wreckage, women, men.
