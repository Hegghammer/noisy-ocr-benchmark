THE STORY OF EEAN THE FISHERMAN'S SON
on the ass, and the ass is driven back over the
mountains into the ountry that they came from,
these
own the river and
car
world is as
mighty
as three
hundred and
street
| are
there three
palaces,
and to every palace
undred and
sixty-five steps leading up
IT
edony. The streets whe
ame into them
were.thronged with mighty
rded men. I
was much in dread when
se great
streets, and looked on the mig.
vent
through them.
In the center of the city were the palace and the
wide-spreading gardens of the King. In
gardens, as my master told me, were one or two of
thone
all the beautiful or terrible animals of the world.
Those gardens I will speak of again, O King,
for it was within them that I came upon the
danger that was greater than the danger that
I am now in.
