Percinesty
PREFACE.
THE subject which we have here treated is a sort of figurative
battle-field, where fierce contests have for ages been from time to time
waged; and, notwithstanding the determined assaults of the attacking
hosts, the contention and its cause remain pretty much as they were at the
commencement of the war. We in the matter remain strictly neutral,
merely performing the part of the public's "own correspondent," making
it our duty to gather together such extracts from despatches both ancient
and modern, as may prove interestip
rant, to take note of the
Les of war, mark its var
3, to do our best
our re
experiences and
argu
stion."

this apparently ind
article of ladies' attire, its construction,
application, and influenc n the figure have become so numerous of late
that we have thought, by embodying and garner
relating to Corsets, their wearers, and the various costumes worn by
ladies at different periods, arranging the subject-matter in its due order
as to dates, and at the same time availing ourselves of careful illustration
when needed, that an interesting volume would result.
