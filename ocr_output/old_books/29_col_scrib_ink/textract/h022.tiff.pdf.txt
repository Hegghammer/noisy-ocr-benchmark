Preface. - Introduction.
Southold. It is still a long old gun, though not as long as it was
once, as it was bursted by overloading on one Thanksgiving Day, and
about eight or ten inches of the muzzle cut off.
The CASK, in which he packed a portion of his househok goeds
Parginat
and brought over with him, is still in existence, and is ewned by
Gilbert W. Horton, of Bay View, Southold. It is doubly historic
from the fact that when the British invaded Long Island was filled
with wheat and buried, thus securing the wheat from the foraging
parties of the British army. It is made of solid oak loops and
all-
the hoops are square and about an inch and a quarte thick-only one
hoop missing. It is used for a grain cask, and wi) hold about fifteen
bushels. It was formerly called "uncle Barney
barrel," as
romance had it, that he brought it over full of
silver.
His WALKING STAFF is still preserved. It
of the Yew tree
wood, has a fine ivory head with the letter
H." and the figures
"1617" in apparently golden specks ing a into it, from which it
would seem that it once belonged to his and that J. H. (Joseph
Horton) were his initials. It is n owned by Silas R. Horton, of
Goshen, N. Y.
Many other mementos Puritan are In existence, some of
Z
them in the Long Island P corical Rooms, Brooklyn, N. Y.
THE HORTS N NAME-FIRST.SETTLERS IN THIS COUNTRY.
The wor Horton in the Anglo-Saxon language means an enclosure,
or of vegetables. It is said to be derived from ort and tun,
ort, meaning plant, and tun, enclosed. The name is evidently of
Vr
Latin origin, and has been known in England ever since conquest
of Cassar.
O
The Hortons in England, and their descendants in America, have
generally been cultivators of the soil. They have been found almost
universally in the middle class of society, and it is not known that
any royal blood has ever coursed in their velits. Thes are, and
always
have been, produces rather than consumers, and for industry, integ-
rity, and piety, they will lose nothing in a comparison with the re-
nowned families of either the new or the old world.
The first of the family who emigrated to this country, of whom we
have any authentic record, came over from England IG33 to 1638.
Thomas, Jeremiah, and Barnabas, were among the early emigrants,
and old tradition says they were brothers. Thomas came over in the
" Mary and John," in 1633, settled permanently in Springfield, Mass.
