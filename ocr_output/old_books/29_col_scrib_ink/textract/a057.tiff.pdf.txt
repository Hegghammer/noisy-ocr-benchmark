Chureh, but was also a fearless patriot-a distinguished linguist, an eloquent preacher, and a
thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the feared fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history.

At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunkerstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrivo frow Constantinople, sent
by Monseigneur Nercès, the Patriareh, their object being to request the signatory Powers of
the Berlin Treaty to force a guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.
Abdul Hamid and his advisers were furious at this affront, and Monseigneur Nercès was
summoned to We P Mace. It is said that when he received the summons he simply smiled
and asked one of of his curates to read the Burial Service to him, as he did not expect to
return alive. However, he went. No one has ever heard what passed between the Sultan
and himself at the interview ; suffice it to say that he immediately summoned the Armenian
General Assembly and tendered his resignation. This was not accepted by the Assembly,
and, amidst enthusiastic cheers, he was carried back to his apartments at the Patriarchate.
Meanwhil ler reached him, signed by the Sultan, to recall the Armenian
delegation
from Berlin. This Monseigneur Varjabétian point-blank refused to do, and retired
to his private residence at Haskeuy, il village on the Golden Horn. The success of thodele-
ration, however, did not come up to his expectations. The Armenians, as it happened, could
be heard, but they were so far successful as to have an article inserted in the treaty.

One summer afternoon a most

extreme courtesy to a prt

where dinmer was served. me geniality displayed by his host dispelled any fears that the
Archbishop might have had as to his personal safety.
After dinner, as usual, coffée was served. Now, this serving of the entibe is rather a
ceremonial according to high Turkish etiquette, and it is not unusal for guests to bring their
own tchooboukdar (the servant who carries his master's pipe and pouch and also perintenal
the making of his coffee). The Archbishop was presented with tehoohouk (pfpe) filled

with dne compltments to his host, and took a sip at his coffee.
ust at that moment the
heavy curtains over the doorway were thrown apart, revealing the ghastly pale face of his
servant Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, in a voice trembling with emotion, 'Monseigneur,
I did not brew the coffee!'
This was enough for the Archbishop ; he pretended to be startled and spilt the coffée, but,
alas ! he had already drunk a small quantity of it. a scuille was going on behing
the portiere, where it NOOT servant Vartan was paying the penalty of his devotion tohis
master. Concernité Vartan's whereabouts or his ultimate end nothing was ever made
--the poor fellow simply vanished. Monseigneur Varjabétian, after a short interval thanked
the Pasha for his generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily summoned. The Patriarch took to his bed,
and lost all his hair through the effects of the poison. Then, one morning, when a servant
