rocky cavern-his animals partake of the artificial character of which we cannot bring ourselves to
approve.
Of this fact, however, we purpose to exhibit proof with our assertion
Improved versions, to
the best abilities of our Artists, of some of these Lions of RUBENS and
Assyrian king, will here
be introduced, which the reader, who pleases, may compare with
ginals. Our second, third,
and fourth Plates are of the number.
The Lions of RUBENS are humanized. We do not in
scuss at length whether the
ideality of allegorical painting required this : we only st
: yet the opinions which we
felt at liberty to form on the subject, we feel at liberty
much in apology for using the
licence of asserting that the heads of many of the Lie
ather resemble those of frowning
old grentlemen decorated with Ramillies wigs as
heymen had made manes, and not
made them well. There is a profusion of f
hair ochich seems rather to solicit
the unguents of the perfumer, than to hay
hea
of the desert, or the rough
storms of the forest. The shag of
a

However such dressed Lion

a
variance with Nature. To

allegorical creatures of RUBENS, which,

half his grenius, and placed in savage con-
mets,
