But first the Enchanter showed me that great
wonder that was near the gardens - the Tower
of Babylon. It was a red tower mountiry very
high into the air. Outside of it there tre steps
thatewentnround it and to the y top of
it -- a thousand steps.
And
the top of
the tower, resting against
of Nimrod,
was the Magic Mirror
Labulun the
Enchanter made m
and I was
made fearful by
Z
Oh, that
I
nus, of the
wonders
the shadow
of it there Sre
two Genii
who guarded Baby to
they were
named. Giant beings the
they slept

!cross his
mighty chest, and it was a beard so broad that
no horse of the mighty horses that the King owned
could leap across it. Very great but very old
were Harut and Marut, the guarded
Babylon.

tower. And then I was made still more fearful
