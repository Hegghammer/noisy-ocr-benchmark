description of corsets worn by the ladies of Rome was doubt at that
time lost, the revived taste for slender figures led to the eculiar form

robes we see draping the figures of Childeris'svand Pepin's queens. The
"cottes bardies" were, moreover, clasped at the waist by a broad belt, and
seem pretty well to have merited their martial name, Very soon after
this period it is probable that a much more complete description of
