turn to the position
On the field the ever victorious army of little Japan undermined Russia's
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
defeated and ever retreating army of colossal Russia. At sea the eveng
victorious Japanese Fleet succeeded in completely annihilating the Russian
Fleet. It was ar such as the world had never you seen. The secret of
such astounding successes should be investigated, and here I beg leave to
quote from one of series of articles in which I gave view to my opinions
during the Russo Japanese War. “Japan may be likened to the bundle of
faggots in the fable firmly ried together; one faggot of larger dimensions in
the centre, the sovereign round whom the whole nation clusters, and all,
ruler and people tied together adamantine bands of patriotism.”
These remarks of mine were ased on observations of actual facts. In
national unity Japan stands as an object lesson to the world; she furnishes
an examplen hich the world needs to co, and which a nation so politically
forlorn as ourselves more than any other eds to copy.
From the astounding success of Japar
Great Republic of the United States of
in the world, and
take the lesson to heart of what Unie
ontrast their
present position with the position the
occupied
when they first landed on Ante
undred years ago.
National Unity is our greates
which we must
raise up over our national life. National
ven on the
tablets of our minds and throb in the pulses
There are
mountains of difficulties before us, and if ever we must
can only do so by being bound together like the bundle of lage the
fable, with no weakening or loosening of the bands. Then perhap
might once more be able to get an independent footing on the historica
of our fathers, and perhaps once more rally round our own flag A Japan-
ese lives for the State, not for himself; we have no State for which to live,
but let us live for our communities whilst we keep the hope in our hearts
that communities grow into States.
We have grit and endurance in an unparalleled degree, but these
characteristics will profit us nothing if we are wanting in unity.
Let us remember that utterance of the Founder of our faith. In our
loyalty and allegiance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents of a
cataract, but we must remember His warning utterance :—
What shall it profit a man." What shall it profit a nation. Unity is
the soul of a nation. Let us keep our soul and not lose it.
