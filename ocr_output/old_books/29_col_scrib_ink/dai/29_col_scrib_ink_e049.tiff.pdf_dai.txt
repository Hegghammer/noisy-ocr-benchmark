RESEARCH fails to show us that the ladies of Frin their simple
Hersvingian and Carlovingian dresses paid an ttention to the
formation of the waist or its display. But during the th century we
find the dresses worn extremely tight, and so made as to define the waist
and render it as slim as possible; and although the art of making the
description of corsets worn by the ladies of Rome was doubt at that
time lost, the revived taste for slender figures led to the eculiar form of
corsage known as cottes hardies, which were much stiffened and worn
extremely tight. These took the place of the quaint oddly-formed
robes we see draping the figures of Childeries and Pepin's queens. The
"cottes hardies" were, moreover, clasped at the waist by a broad belt, and
seen pretty well to have merited their martial name. Very soon after
this period it is probable that a much more complete description of
corset was invented, although we do not find any marked representation
of its form until 1043.
