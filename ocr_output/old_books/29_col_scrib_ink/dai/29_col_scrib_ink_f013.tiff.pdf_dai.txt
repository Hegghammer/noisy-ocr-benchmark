Scientific hiss
hifasci
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific
torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and exalted the villains, for whom of old no
mud was too thick and slab. Beliefs are being
assailed on every side. To abolish the traditional
courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the considerat
conduct of Captain Hind would, theref
strokes of the unkindest, and I have here
no such iconoclasm. Even where
lieve, I have told the tale-when
worth the telling as it is
trials, or in Smith on Lak
sources, decorously stripped of
For really, where much
may be fully proved and to
turns out not rarely to be false, 'tis yo.
To continue the story of the highwaymen
Smith and Johnson down to the approaching end
of all such things in the beginning of the nine-
teenth century, is like taking up and concluding
a half-told tale. But it was worth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpin has
always made, has it been found really necessary
to seriously sider and re-state the career of
that much-overrated scoundrel, and to put him
in his proper place a very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
