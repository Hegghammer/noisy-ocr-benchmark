from Smith, who himself was prone to include
the most extravagant myths in his pages,
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE LIKES AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAMOUS
HIGHWAYMEN. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the truth of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.
No one has ever reprinted those authors in
their original extravagance, or their grossness.
It would be impossible; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
them, or even written an independent history of
consider how astonish-
mances have ever been
de Du Vall, and Turpin,
_heroes, this is not a little
surprise
Perhathe task has been abandoned because
of the difficulty-the almost insuperable difficulty
â€”of sifting fact from fiction, and because of a
chilling sense that it would be a thankless task
to present the highwayman as he really was:
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No novelist nould
be likely to the frank historian for this dis-
service; and do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
