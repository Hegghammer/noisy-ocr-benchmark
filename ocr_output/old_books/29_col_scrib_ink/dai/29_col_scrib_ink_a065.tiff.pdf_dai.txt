Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, greater marauders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation of whose lives comprises
murder and robbery, and who have through weary centuries unremittingly
quartered themselves upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits of their labour and toil. Inde as the Hamidieh cavalry which
was established expressly for the
Han massacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter ation what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized
now find for those habits in
which they were encouraged
indulge by the Hamidian
r√©gime.
Under all such condition
ays can be forthcoming
no prospect of better time
unhappy portion of the
Armenian race whom
keeps on the soil of the
fatherland,
The appointm or Christian governors over the provinces in-
habited by them might ameliorate same of the evils, or the other alternative,
allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespective of creed or
nationality, would furnish some means of self-defence against the raids
life for the christian peasant subject to Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his enemies, must remain one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Not the most fertile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the most assiduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, can bring to the
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
happiness, and security of life and property, which the law of all civilized
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer and ther of the soil.
