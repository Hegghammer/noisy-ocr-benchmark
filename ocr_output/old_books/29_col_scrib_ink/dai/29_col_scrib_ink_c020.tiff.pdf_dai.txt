z
story-tellers place and fresh candles were lighted
and set upon the table.
“Your danger is great," said the King, “and it
will be hard for you to show us that you were
ver in such danger before. Begin your story.
A if it is not a story of a narrow and a close
es there will be little time left for you to pre-
par your death by the sword.”
Ton the youth in the foreign dress looked
long i wine cup that was handed him, and
he dra aught of the wine, and he saluted
the Kin
lords who sat by the King, and
he said:
"Once
gr
danger, for its mouth
was close to nd no hope tever was given
me of my sa my life. I wih
the story,
and you shall e whether my danger hen was
greater than isy danger now.”
And thereup the youth in the foreign dress,
who had tried to steal the white horse that King
Manus owned, began the story which is set down
here in the very words in which he told it.
