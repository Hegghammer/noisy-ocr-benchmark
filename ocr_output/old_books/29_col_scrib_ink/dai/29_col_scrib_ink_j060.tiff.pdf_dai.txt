Primitive Methods.-Briefly the primitive process of convert-
ing the rattan, or raw material, into cane and reeds, or the finished
product, is this: The rattan stems are thoroly dried or seasoned,
and the nodules are pared off with a peculiar native knife. Then the
rattan is sorted into sizes and selection made as to grade. The sort-
ing is based upon external color and diameter of the rattan. The
rattan is then immersed in water, and the stem is rubbed vigorously
with sand and cocoanut husks to remove dirt and foreign substances.
His then bleached by means of sulphur fumes, either in the stem or
after theel and core have been prepared.

raw material varies some it from the Chinese method in that the
natives do not bleach the rattan.
Reed may be procured in large or small hanks, in coils and in
bundles, with the cost determined by weight. Schools generally
will find it advantageous to buy it in small hanks, because of ease in
handling and for economic reasons. Round reeds are shown
