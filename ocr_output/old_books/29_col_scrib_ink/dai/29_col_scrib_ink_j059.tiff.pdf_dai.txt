CHAPTER VI
REED AND SPLINT WEAVING
Reeds which are used exte sively for basket-making and weaving
in general are procured from the species of palm described in Chap-
1. These reeds show not be confused with the term reed

only a few are native in the United States,
inct commercial value. The rattan or cane
Islands grow to an unusual height,
in great quantities. These rat-
ne species Calamus have as main
Calcutta. These palms are stripped
into round and flat strips of different
er bark, when stripped into proper
ntire palm, with leaves removed,
as rattan; and the flat reeds are frequently
h and pith cane. Inasmuch as these flat and round
om the palm plant and exported under the name of
called reeds, we shall refer to them under that name in
ussions to follow. There are two qualities of reed on the
et sold under the names of China reed and German reed. The
mer is inferior in quality and the latter is superior, being strong,
tough and durable. The Philippine Islands give promise of pro-
ducing a liberal supply of reed of good quality that is claimed to
equal the German product. The problem, however, is one of gath-
ering and marketing the product. The government has made a
partial survey of the rattan supply, and this justifies the belief that
the Islands will eventually compete with the world market.
