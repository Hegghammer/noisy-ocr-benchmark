Avert Thy gaze
Glance down.no
Lest Thou behol
Men's burning h
ouls.
Keep Thine heart
That Thou mayst
Andy feel for
in de
rity

not when
sacrifice.

Rest Thy
nd keep Thine hand in
check;
Smite not, nor fiercely thrust without the pale
Those who can dare to strew the ocean waste
With fellow creatures, innocent of wrong.
o
Forget the studied purpose to destroy;
The launching of the missile through the deep;
The shattered hull; the crushed and bleeding forms;
The seething swirl of wreckage, women, men.
