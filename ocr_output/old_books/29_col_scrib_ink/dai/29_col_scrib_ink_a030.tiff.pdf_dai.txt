The efforts of the Armenians, and the entreaties of their Patriarch
Nerses had procured the insertion of Article 16 in the Treaty of San
wording of Article had been suggested by the Patriarch bankert neg
provided the wing stipulation for the protection of the
Armenians -
"As the ion by the Russian troops
the territory which they
now occupy in
and which is to be restored to Turkey, might give
rise to conflic
lications detrimental to the maintenance of good
relations betwee
ntries, the Sublime Porte engages to carry into
effect without fu
improvement and reforms demanded by
local requirement
es inhabi
by the Armenians, and to
guarantee their se
ircassians."
What followed

the old policy of baffling Russian
aggrandizement in Tu

and virtually commande
ution of the Treaty of Berlin in lieu of
the Treaty of San Stefan

immediate protector, bot and desiroumof enforcing the protection which
the Armenians then ha ussia, was taken away, and the security of im-
potent words given instead, namely :—
"The Sublim te undertakes to carry out without further delay the
improvements ar reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces
inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the
Circassians Kurds. It will periodically make known the steps taken to
this effect to the Powers, who will superintend their application."
It will periodically make known the steps taken to this effect

Powers, who will superintend their application How this last 
provise
could furnish food for laughter were it not for the terrible tragedy involved
in it.
The insertion of Article 61 in the Treaty of Berlin, granted, or rather
seemingly granted, by the six Powers of Europe, proved in reality, as sub-
sequent events bore out, an instrument of death and torture. It was as if
the reversal for the figures had reversed the possibilities of succour and
protection and with the death of the Czar Liberator, the last chance of the
Armenians died.
The Turkish Massacres of 1875 and 1876 which led up to the Russo-
Turkish War of 1877 are historical facts too well known to need further
