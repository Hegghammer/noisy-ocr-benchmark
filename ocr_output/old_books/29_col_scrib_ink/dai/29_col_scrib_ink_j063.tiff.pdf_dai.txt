tion of air. If colors have been mixed properly and thinned to the
right consistency, the reed will dry rapidly and the color will be
sharp and clear, free from muddy effects.

Sufficient to say that this fiber adapts itself admirably to almost

is, commercially, supplanting reed.
Inner hickory bark may be obtained of manufacturers of rustic

cational value of weaving. In the spring or early summer when
the sap is up and the bark slips easily, a hickory tree may be cut

on either side of the shaved strip; then beginning at one end peel
