DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE.
ating
I have thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested witnesses.
"We are having a perfectly hideous time here. Thousands have been murdered-23
in this province they say; but the number is probably greater, for every Christian village
was wiped out In Adana about 5000 have perished. After Turks and Armenians had
made peace, the Turks came in the night with hose and kerosene. and set fire to what remained
of the Armenian quarter. Next day the French and Armenian schools were fired. Nearly every-
one in the Armean school perished, anybody trying to escape being shot down by thesoldiers."
"The Turkish Authorities do nothing except arrest unoffending Armenia from whomi
by torture they extort the most fanciful confessions. Even the wounded a not safe fro
their injustice. A man was being carried in to me yesterday when he wa zed and
off to gaol. I dare not think what his fate may be.
"For fiends incarnate commend me to the Turks. Nobody is
murder babies in front of their mothers; they half murder men, and
the husbands are lying there dying in pools of blood."
"The authorities did nothing, and the soldiers were worse
better armed. Une house in our quarter was burned with
the bodies. The soldiers set fire to the door, and as the
could get out. Everybody in the house was roasted
children and old people.”—Extract from letter of Mrs
at Adana ; published in the London “Daily Mail.”

IN THIS HOUSE 115 WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ROASTED ALIVE.
History repeats itself. In 1895 Turkish soldiers fell upon seventy to eighty young
women and girls in a church, where they had fled for refuge, and after hideously outraging
them, barricaded them in, setting fire to the building at the same time, and derisively shouting
to their victims as they were being roasted alive, to call upon their Christ to save them now
