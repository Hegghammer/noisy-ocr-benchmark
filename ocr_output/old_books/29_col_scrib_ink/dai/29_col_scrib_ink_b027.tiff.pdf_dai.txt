CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

No. VI.
In this GROUP by MR. EDWIN LANDSEER there is much of violent animal Expression, and
Character fades before it, or rather, is absorbed in it. It tells a story of the past as well as the
present, and is pregnant with a catastrophe not difficult to anticipate from the actions and
expressions of the parties engaged. A FAWN has been seized by a LEOPARD, who has been
despoiled of his prey by a more powerful TIGER. The Tiger in his turn becomes the victim of an
enraged LION.
The expression of the wounded Leopard is that of painful suffering mingled read.
Together, they amount to agony. He shrieks while he submits. The

Of this genera of Cats, we here exhibit the four principal species, Lions, Tigers, Leopards,
and Panthers, of which the Lion is justly placed at the head-at least, the unanimous voice of ages
has pronounced him to be the king of beasts, and we have enthroned him accordingly in our Title-
page, (No. I.) They form a tribe that is especially and properly Carnivorous, being the only
class of quadrupeds that are exclusively flesh-eaters. Their jaws are very completely armed for
this purpose; their canine teeth being very long and angular, with the edges of the angles turned
toward the inside of their mouths; so that when the animal has caused them to meet or cross each
other in the flesh of its prey, these formidable teeth will cut or tear a way through, by drawing
them back without opening his mouth.
Their claws, and the formation of their feet, too, are eminently conducive to their predacious
