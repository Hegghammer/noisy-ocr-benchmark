Woodworking shops in manual training schools far outnumber
those for other manual activities, and as a result, courses in wood-
work have come to be termed the stable courses in a handwork
curriculum. However, experience in woodwork alone is not suf-

activities to give to the boy a proper foundation for choice of
vocation.

work, espelly if woodwork is the only course offered, is thru the
use of such diums as cane, reed rush, splints and allied materials
in correla with the wood. These materials add life to the
problems nerally arousterest and enthusiasm in the work
