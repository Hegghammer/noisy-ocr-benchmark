Crest, out of the waves of the sea profer, a tilting spear crest, gold; called with a dolphin,
silver, fonol, golf, and charged with a shell.

artist has not given the shell upon the dolphin.]

Arus are hereditary, but the mottoes are not, and may be changed to suit the taste or fancy of
any family. There are other Arms of the Horton family, varying somewhat from the above. The
date of the grant of the arms I have not found-probably many centuries ago.
