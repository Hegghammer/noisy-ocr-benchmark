second peg. This operation is repeated until all holes have been
utilized on the two parallel rails, excepe those on the corners,
Throout the seven operations it is necessary that the came be key
from twisting by drawing the remaining part of the strand th

Step 2. The second step is identical with the first, with the dif-
ference that the other two parallel rails are used, and that the
canes run over the first set of parallel
canes. If the first strand of cane ha

Step 3. This step is a repetition of the first two. The canes of
this series run see the first and second series and parallel with the
first. As each strand is used up hind the end by pulling it undry
a cane, croming from one hole to another underneath the frame
and cutting off about 34 in, from the came. Fig. 5 shows how this
binding is done. The loose end at the starting point is tied in this
way, and all subsequent ones should be tied as they come, the

Stop The actual weaving begins with this step. It may by
done entirely by hand, without resort to the needle, but it is slow
work. The needle should be used. Start at a hole next to a corner
on either rail that has been used but see, working from caned side
toward the open frame. Go over and under the strands necessary
to form the weave, turning the needle from side to side in order to
catch the canes behind the point. When across thread the needle
with the strand and pull thru, being careful to avoid a twist. Pull
the end down thru the hole, pairing the canes. Pall the came up
thru the next bole; then start the needle from the opposite side of
the frame and repeat the first operation, thus pairing another set
of canes Continue until all canes are paired and all holes used.
Soak the woven came with a wet sponge, and with two pegs
straighten the strands of cane and force all pairs together. Small,
