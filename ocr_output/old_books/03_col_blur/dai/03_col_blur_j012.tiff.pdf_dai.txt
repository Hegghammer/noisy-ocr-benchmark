FEAT WEAVING
Came is named from the narrowest to the widest in order:
carriage, superfine, fine-for, for, medium, common, narrow binder,
and wide hinder. Cane from India has a very glowy surface, while
that from other localities is duller. The right side of the came is
easily determined by this glowines
Cane for weaving purposes should not be confused with the
popularly called came or hamboo of our southern states, where it
forms the well known cane-brakes. This cane rarely exceeds a
height of 20 it. It grows rapidly and very straight, and to an
appreciable diameter. Such cane is used for bamboo furniture,
walking sticks, poles, etc. The ordinary domestic sugar cane, also,
should not be confused with seating cane.
Equipment. The tools needed in cane weaving are few
number. A special one is called the caning needle. This may be
made in the school shop. Fig. 1 shows a working drawing of the
needle. Its length is variable, depending spon the work at hand.
It is desirable to have a number of different lengths. The tool is
made of good flexible steel wire. This is flattened at one end, an
eye cut in it, Nunt pointed, and slightly curved as indicated. The
other end is inserted in an ordinary small tool handle, extended
thru and riveted. The riveting prevents the wire from drawing
out of the handle under a polling strain
The other tools needed are a scratch awl, and a pair
or knife. A button-hook with the hook straightened or cut off
