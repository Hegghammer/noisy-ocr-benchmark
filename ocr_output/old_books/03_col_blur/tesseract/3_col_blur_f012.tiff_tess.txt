vil PREFACE
JSrom Smith, who himself was prone to include
” the most extravagant myths in his pages, calls
hie folio A Gexenat axp True History or
The Lives axp Acrioxs or tae Most Famous
Hieuwaymes. Doth of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the “trath” of much in Smith
and Johnaon, the less said the better.

No one has ever reprinted those authors in
their original extravagance, or their grosences.
It would be impossible ; and, if possible, it would
wot be entertaining. Nor has any one ecer edited
them, or even wrillen an independent history of
the highicaymen. When we consider how astonish-
ingly popular those romances hace ever been
which hace had Claude Du Vall, and Turpin,
and their like for heroes, thia ia not a little
surprising.

Perhaps the task has been abandoned because
o the difficulty—the almost inanperable difficulty
—o° sifting fact from fiction, and because of a
chilling sense that it would be a thankless task
lo present the highiwcayman as he really was: a
Sellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No novelist would
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dis-
service ; and I do nol think the hiatorian who came
to the subject in thia cold scientific apiril of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
