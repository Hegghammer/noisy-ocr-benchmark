Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
‘Turkish rule? To this question, we must answer an emphatic No!

The causes that must operate against any change are many and deep-
seated. In the on = waht) be expected that's few Turks ——
ideas (or it may be F ished) at i are going to
the thought and character of the nation. The characteristics of a people
change very slowly, if they ever change at all, and the predominant national
traits of the many-blooded modern Turk have been shown to the world to
be, cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a fierce erage A and what is
more than all, and which has to be remembered most, is, t they are a
people accustomed to the unbridled gratification of their worst passions.

The ethnographic traits of the Turkman which history bears out, are
wildness and fierceness, and it woukl not be incorrect to argue that with the
instincts of his primitive ancestors have been assimilated the many cross
currents that run in his veins, into all of which has been infused the
doctrines of the religion of the sword, a religion which Coes not make for
= peace or well he degra mankind ; a reoe. also, a assigning one of
the two sexes to the degraded ion of being creat r the gross
pleasure of the other, does not rake for the exaltation Lf marking.

To quote again the eminent authority previously referred to: “ No
Mahommedan race or dynasty has ever shown itself able to govern well
even subjects of its own religion, while to extend equal rights to subjects of
a different creed is forbidden by the very law of its being.

Not the Jewish conceit proclaiming itseli God's clect and chosen, and
originating the name “heathen " which it scorned. Not the Christian conceit
emanating from the Jewish source, and laying the flatreriog unction to its
soul of superiority over the “heathen of its own time. Not the unbending
caste cxclusiveness of the Brahman across whose pe ore the shadow
the despised Sudra Ee Not any of these,
can equal the intolerant religious prile of the Mahommedan, or reach the
olemaie of religious self-sufficiency on which he has seated himself. To be
a Mahommedan, is enough—Ce/a suffit.

To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans, and
intimate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahommedan is above all things a Mahommedan. His
religion is the paramount oie in his life, and remains its predominating
ao everything else. ae not be surprising, since to the
faithful” Paradise is secured, and all crimes t ions against
“unbelievers " absolved. a
