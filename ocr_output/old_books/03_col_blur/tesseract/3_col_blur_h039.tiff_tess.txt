and a lover of good order in society, which he always labored zealously
and succemfally to promote. He was temperate in his habits and ex-
emplary in his character. He never disgraced the name he bore, and
his virtues are worthy of imitation by all his powerity. He and his
elder brother Henry settled near cach other on Point Salubriow,

which is a neck of land running out about four mil into Chamount
Bay. Here they took up Garms, had fine fishing grounds, and raised
| large Gamilies.— Letter of Van Rants Horton.
