The reader will sce at a glance the plan of this book. We com-
_ mence with the Christian name. Then follows the parentage, genea-
logical data, &c., and then the Christian names of the children and
onter of births In many of the carly families the exact onler of
births cannot be ascertained ; bet it has been approximated as nearly
as posible. The lineage is given in connection with the firs member
of the &amily. The Koman numerals indicate the order of births.
The som: and daughters of the old Puritan, Barnabas, constitate the
| second generation, Let they are spoken by way of eminence as Jowph
L, Hannah 1, &e. The book contains mech repetition, bet none

too much to make it plain and casy to study.

This little book contains the chronicles of only about one-half of
the Horton families looked up. Those whose genealogical data are
given only in a small part, and tho whos correct lineage has not
been satisfactorily axertained, are not included in this book.
