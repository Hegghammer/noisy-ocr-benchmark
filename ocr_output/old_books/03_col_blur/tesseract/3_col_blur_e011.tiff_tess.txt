PREFACE. vid
writing in praise of the moderate use of Corsets take their facts,
experiences, and grounds of argument from the every-day life and
general custom of the present period.

The Crinoline is too closely associated with the Corset and with the
| mutable modes affected by ladies, from season to season, to be omitted
from any volume which treats of Fashion. The same facts, indeed, may be
stated of both the Crinoline and the Corset. Both appear to be equally
indispensable to the woman of the present period. To make them
serve the purposes of increased cleanliness, comfort, and grace, not only
without injury to the health, bot with positive and admitted advantage
to the physigue—these are the problems to be solved by those whose
business it is to minister to the ever-changing taste and fashion of
* the day. 2
