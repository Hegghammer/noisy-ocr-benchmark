I will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and relate ie secs of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
1796 alter ruling over Armenia filty-cight years.

He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his dominions, and
grew to be so mighty in battle that the neighbouring nations called his
country Aramia and the people were called Aramians, such names as
Armenia or Armenians being no doubt later corruptions.

The first victory of Aram was over Neuchar king of Media, whom he
took prisoner and put to death, and made a large part of the country of the
defeated prince ny his own. ‘The second victory of Aram was over
Barsham king of Babylon, whom also he took prisoner and put to death.
The next victory was over the king of en the army of the
ao was pursued to the very shores of the Mediterranean, and the

of Cappadocia fell into the hands of Aram B.C. 1796. Also Ninus
king of Assyna, at one time an cager enemy, awed by the victories of Aram,

No douls if the volumes and scripts of paper or parchment of the famous
Alexandrian library, which burned for six months as fuel in the four thousand

the ancient kingdoms of Western Asia might be known in our day ; and also
when the tide of Islam victory rolled over the kingdom of Armenia, how
much of the story and coon wos Pecee wae oe and destroyed along
with the destruction of their i es would be difficult now to calculate

to us, there scems to le grounds for supposing that the “ Aramaans”
designated by foreign writers as “a people of Semitic race language and
religion, coming from Northern Arabia and settling in the region between
the western boundaries of Habylonia and the highlands of Western Asia”
were no other than the Hai who under their King Aram had spread their
— and their kingdom into Mesopotamia and even to the shores of
the Mediterranean.

Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when he includes
Northern Mesopotamia, together with the mountainous country of Ararat,
under the name of Armenia, and in writing of the Armenian boats that
brought merchandise to Rabylon, he remarks that they were constructed in
Armenia, in the parts abere Assyria.
