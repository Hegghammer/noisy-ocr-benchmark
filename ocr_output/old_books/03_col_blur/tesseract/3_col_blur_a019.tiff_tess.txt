INTRODUCTION
TO Ix» PRINTING,

My object in writing this little book is to Fete hard case of my un-
fortunate race before the men and women of the United States ; since it is
from the United States that the American Missionaries have forth, who

go into print. ie nen es pe Semgered and oko keel the oo
even the imaginations of fiends and devils coukd originate such horrors.
