On the field the ever victorious army of little Japan undermined Russia's
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
deleated and ever retreating army of colossal Russia. At sea the ever
victorious Japanese Fleet Seeded in completely annihilating the Russian
Fleet. It was war such as the world had never yet seen. The secret of
such astounding successes shouki be investigated. and here I beg leave to

from one of a series of articles in which | gave view to my opinions
doring the appt 9 rag War. “Japan may be likened to the bundle of
faggots in the firmly tied together ; one faggot of larger dimensions in
the centre, the sovereign round whom the whole nation clusters, and all,
ruler and people tied together by adamantine bands of patriotism.”

These remarks of mine were based on observations of actual facts. In
national unity Japan stands as an object lesson to the world; she furnishes
an example which the worki needs to copy, and which a nation so politically
forlorn as ourselves more than any other needs to copy.

From the astounding success of Japan let us turn to the position the
Great Republic of the United States of America ies in the world, and

National Unity is our greatest need: it is the banner which we must
raise up over our national life. National Unity must be engraven on the
tablets of our minds and throb in the. palses of our hearts. There are
mountains of difficulties before us, and if ever we must reach the goal we
can only do so by being bound together like the bundle of faggots in the
fable, with no weakening or loosening of the bands. Then perhaps we
might once more be able to get an independent footing on the historical soil
of our fathers, and perhaps once more rally round our own flag. A Japan-
ese lives for the State, not for himself: we have te Seas fi which to lve,
but let us live for our communities whilst we keep the hope in our hearts
that communities grow into States.

Let us remember that utterance of the Founder of our faith. In our
loyalty and allegiance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents of a
cataract, but we must remember His warning utterance :-—

“What shall it aman.” What shall it tanation. Unity is
the soul of a nation. Let us keep our seul aed nok love i a
