As these sheets are going through the press there comes news of famine
at Zeitoun. The Rev. F. W. Macullum, heecloas Missionary at Marash,
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet, American Missionary at Constantinople, that
eee gee around Zetoon are dying of hunger; they are weadering
about in rags, mixing bran and water, and cookiny and eating it, if they can
get even that. Rev. Macullum adds, “The same story comes to us from all
sides. As we foresaw all along, from now on the distress will be greatest.”

If $0,000 were massacred, the list of those who have died and are dying
of homelessness and starvation will exceed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerated. Last year the pcople reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.

escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered in a night attack

tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack emieeohendak. It is
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
