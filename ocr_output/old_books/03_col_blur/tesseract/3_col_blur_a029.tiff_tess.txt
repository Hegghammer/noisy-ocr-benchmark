PART L
THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN

Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the still more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel in history

In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of Europe
bat in the interests of Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood)

It was a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of “ ty
terrible stronghold of Kars,” universally admitted to be one of the greatest
and most difficult military exploits ever achieved, and the crowning success
of the Russian arms in Asiatic Turkey, should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General; that although Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest, and Armenian soldiers fought, conquered and
died, yet by these successes not only was no amelioration attained of the
hard fate of their unhappy nation under Turkish rule, but that fate, hard
before, was made a hundredfold and even a Uiousandfokd harder
