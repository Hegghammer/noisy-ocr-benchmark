“I was born in Vorktown, Westchester County, New York, 1
September, 1806. My parents were farmers, in moderate circum-
ances. I remained with them until I was eeventeen, working on the
farm in the sommer, amd going to school in the winter, thas acquiring
merely a common-school education. When I was seventeen years old,
at the suggestion of my parents, I decided to learn the blacksmith
trade, and commenced the basiness at once, and served an appren-
tieeship for seweral years. On the 17th of October, 1827, I married
Phebe Tompkins, and on the oth of March, 1820, we moved to Pocks-

. Lill village, where we have resided ever since. I bought some pro-
perty, amd wet ap the blackwnithing busines I sacceedled well in the
besinew In the spring of 1835 I entered into a co-partnership bad-
new with Mr. Truman Minor, amder the firm name of * Minor & Hor-
ton,’ am went into the foundry badeos, manufacturing agricultaral
implements, principally ploaghs and ploagh-<asiags, Our basinew
increased rapidly, and paki os well. We continund partner for
twenty years, In s8¢¢ Mr. Minor retired from basins, and I took
in Mr. Geo. W. Depew as a partner, and aboot two years afterwards,
we admitted cach of us a son, and the firm then became, ‘ Horton,
Depes & Sons." Our manufactured articles were sold in nearly every
State in the Union, and also in many foreign countries.

“In 1862 we all sold ont to a tock company, formed for that par-
pow. Having been in active basines for thirty years, I now retired.
In the spring of 185¢ I was elected Supervisor of the town of Cort-
landt, and I represented that town in the Board of Supervisors for five
years in succowion.

“In the winter of 1458, 1 was a member of the I -gislature from
this Asembly Diarict. For many years I held the various offices of

. our village, bat of late have declined official ations, preferring the
enjoyments of private life.”

Mr. Horton ix not a public profewor of Christianity, bat is a gen-
theman of correct moral deportment, and very temperate ia his ho'dts.
