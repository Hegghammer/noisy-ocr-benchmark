THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE. 29 |
:
Oriental figure of speech, is said to have been ‘ravished by the beauty
of her sandals.’ Like the belles of Egypt she did not disdain, in setting
off her charms, to have recourse to perfumes and cosmetics, and
previously to setting out she ‘anointed herself with precious ointment.’
In another place Jezebel is said to ‘paint her eyelids ;’ and Solomon, in
the Proverbs, in describing the deceitful woman, adjures his son not to
be ‘taken with her cyclids,’ evidently alloding to the use of collyrium. =|
The Jewish beauty owed no slight obligation to her Juxuriant tresses, |
which were decorated with waving plumes and strings of pearls; and
in allusion to this custom, followed among the tribes from time imme- |
morial, St. Paul affirms that ‘a woman’s ornament is her hair.’ Judith
*braided the hair of her head and pet a tire upon it ;’ and the headdress
of Pharaoh’s daughter, in the Canticles, is compared by Solomon to |
Carmel. No mention is made of Judith’s mirror, but it was undoubtedly
made of brass, like those described in Exodus xxxvili. 8 as ‘the |
looking-glasses of the women which assembled at the door of the )
tabernacle of the congregation.’”
