King of the Normans, and Edward, his son, whose death occurred in the
year 1308. So that corsets were, even in those early days, aed by
gentlemen as well as ladies. |
| The term kirtle, s0 often referred to, may not clearly convey to the
| mind of the modern reader the nature of the garment indicated by it,
and therefore it may not be amiss to give Strutt’s description of it. He
says, “ The kirtle, or, as it was anciently written ‘tertel,’ is a part of the
dress used by the men and the women, but especially by the latter. It
was sometimes a habit of state, and worn by persons of high rank.” The
garment sometimes called a “ surcel” Chaucer renders firth, and we
have no reason to dispute his authority. Kirtles are very frequently
| mentioned in old romances, They are said to have been of different
| textures and of different colours, but especially of green; and sometimes
they wore laced clossty to the body, snd pecbeliy eaqeerell aa
| of the bodice or stays—vide Launfal, before to:—
: « Their hires were of rede condel,
) I Laced salle, jollyf, and well.”
) To appear in a kirtle only seems to have been a mark of servitude.
| Thus the lady of Sir Ladore, when he feasted the king, by way of
| courtesy waited at the table—
The lady was grotyll and emul, ;
Tn Kinthe alone she served ie ball.”
We are further informed that at the close of the fifteenth century it
was used as a habit of penance, and we read that Jane Shore, when
