be
orgy, except to call them fiends incarnate ; and who is the bold man who
can guarantee that these same fiends incarnate have become metamorphosed
and changed all of a “oper —— a handful of liberal ge at Con-
stantinople are capable controlling and restraining them. We have not
even heard that the leaders and participators of ‘oe last massacres have
been puni as they deserved ; and what is the reason they are left un-
i ? because the Government is afraid to punish Mahonunalans for
ing Christians; because the liberal Turks dare not punish the “ true

believers " for killing “ Kaffirs.”

The religion of Mahommed, the religion of the sword, has been infesed
into the Turk, and to understand the of the religion of Mahommed
upon the Turk, it is necessary to regard it from four sepacts, or from four
Boints of analysis. First, the fundamental doctrine and law of the religion.

the character of the founder as an example to his followers, ‘Third,
the racial and ethnographic characteristics of the Turk. Fourth, the effect
which this particular religion would be likely to have on this particular race.
When we have viewed the Turk and his government from these four points
of analysis, we have the explanation of all the woe and desolation which
have lain over the countries under Turkish rule.

“When ye encounter the unbelievers strike off their beads until you
have made a great slaughter of them” is a chapter of the Koran which the
Turk has religiously amd steadfastly made his creed.

In conclusion, I will ask my readers to compare one point of difference
between the two races, the oppressor and the oppressed. Thousands upon
thousands of Armenian women, thousands upon thousands of Armenian
children, have been hounded to death, or savagely, ferociously, horribly and
cmaty maleated by the Turk, and yet in all the agonizing years when
Massacre has succeeded upon Massacre, has there been one known case or
one single instance of a Turkish weman or child maltreated by Armenians ?

The last massacres though especially onganized from the Palace at
Constantinople, were officially announced to originate from an afiray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed one of the three :
given equal n and arms, the Armenian is always a match for the

urk, but alas for him that unequal numbers and want of arms have always
made him the victim of his oppressor.

Ahmed eee | in the first part een ee book " La Crise de
L’Orient” publi in Paris in 1907 holds a brief for his nation which
through its own fallacious arguments falls to the ground. I will quote one
passage as an example.
