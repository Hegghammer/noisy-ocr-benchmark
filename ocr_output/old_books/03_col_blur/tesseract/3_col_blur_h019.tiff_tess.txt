MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE.

Kt will be seen by the engraving that the ol hows is double. The
western part is that which was beilt by Marnalas in 1659-60. The
cast OF two-story part was beilt by Jonathan L., about 1682. The upper
room of this part was mex! for a court-home for pcarly twenty years,
as we learn from Thompuon’s History of Long Iand, and some of
the old benches auxd when it was a court-house are still preserved.
The old *‘castle,"’ as Jonathan G. Horton, its lat Horton occupant,
weed to call it, is in all probability the oldest wood hows in America.
I know of no dwelling howe of any kind, stone or brick, now stand- :
ing, that can date back as far as this venerable ok! mansion. ‘There
were a few hats on the cast of Long Island previogs to 1640—two or
three it is mid on Shelter Intand. Hat these, as well as thoue bailt by
the Puritans, immediately on their settlement in Southold, soon all
paecd away. Not a vestige of any of the fire generation buiklings
can be found except this one. It remained for the hoaw that Barnabas
built to survive the wreck of ages, and to stand today as a noble :
representative of the dwellings of two hundred and fifteen years ago.
Bat the old hows stands today not only as peering above all others
by its age, bat also by its occupancy. It is not very often that we find
two generations of the sume mame, living and dying in the same howwe—
rarely find three. Bat here we have six generations in saccemion, all
bearing the Horton name, living and dying in the same howe, and
all born in it except Barnabas I, and his won Jonathan. We may go
to the castles amd palaces of the ok! world, and search long and dili-
gently, and Gail to find a paralicl cae.

With a few repairs, the old cautle may yet stand for generations Gr
in the fature.

It rexpuires some thougit and reflection to realize the Lapse of time
since the old howe was built. See the old Puritan hienelf there
twenty years; then his som Jonathan, twenty-cight your; and then
Jonathan, Jr., about sixty years; and next Lawrence and Ads son Jona-
