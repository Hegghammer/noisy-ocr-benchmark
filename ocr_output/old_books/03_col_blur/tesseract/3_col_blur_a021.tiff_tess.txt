earth as other nations? Does Humanity, does Christianity allow that tender
babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and butchered
before the eyes of their mothers, or that the ears of mothers should be rent
eee weeny of Ree eerdered licen? Does
ity, docs Christianity a that helpless women should be forcibly
to the most hideous, the most loathsome, the most revolting, and
the most crucl outrages? Does Humanity, does Christianity, allow all this?
Christian Goveraments have organized a Hague Conference of Peace
and Civilization, but they have. closed its doors to the cause of a bleeding
christian race groaning under the yoke of the cruellest oppressors that the
