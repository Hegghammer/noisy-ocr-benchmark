At the death of Jonathan G. Horton, the old homestead became,
by will, the property of the Rev. Mrs. Williams, of Brooklyn, N. Y.,
who was the adopted daaghter of Jonathan G. Horton, he never

went oat of the Horton name.

Mra. Williams propos to sll it, and if some of the Hortons do
not buy it, it will indicate a lack of decent reypect for the old caule,

Horton name, suitably repaired and preserved for the wonder and
admiration of gencrations of Hortoas yet unborn. Jonathan G.
Horton, the short, thick man, and Seuart T. Terry, are the two men
seen in the engraving, in front of the old hous. ~
