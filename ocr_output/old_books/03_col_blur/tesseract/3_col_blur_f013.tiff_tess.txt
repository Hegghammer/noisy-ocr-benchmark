PREFACE m
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we belieced in when schoolboys. Scientific his-
é torians hace degraded many of our ancient heroes
and exalted the cillains, for whom of old no
mad was loo thick and slab.  Beliefa are being
assailed on ecery side. To abolish the traditional
courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the considerate
conduct of Captain Lind would, therefore, be
strokes of the unkindest, and I hace here attempted
no auch iconoclaam. Even where I cannot be-
liece, I hace told the lale—uichenecer il has been
worth the telling—as it is found in criminal
trials, or in Smith or Johnson, and other old
sources, decorously stripped of much cile language.
For really, where mach thal scema incredible
may be fully proved, and where the beliecable
turns out not rarely lo be fulse, ‘tis your only way.
To continue the story of the highweaymen from
Smith and Johnson down to the approaching end
of all auch things in the beginning of the nine-
teenth century, is like taking up and concluding
a half-told tale. But it waa worth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpin has
always made, has it been found really necessary
to seriously consider and re-stale the carcer of
that much-ocerrated scoundrel, and to pul him
in his proper place: a cery much lower one
than he usually occupies.
