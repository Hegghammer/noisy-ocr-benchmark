xIV Priface â€”latratuction,
This book ix mainly what thoe who have kindly fernishad records
amd sketches have made it. The whole has been carefully compiled.
Ret gencalogical works, almost of necowity, contain many error.
Doulclow this small work has its fell share. Bat when errors are dis-
covered, notice thercof shouk! be given, so that a secom! edition may
be made entirely truthfal. Thankful to all who have gencroudy given
their amistance, this work is sent out as a small contribution to the
genealogical literature of the day, and in the hope that a more full
aml extemive book of Horton chronickes may be imecd at no very
distant day.

Terrytown, 10 Jan., 1876.
