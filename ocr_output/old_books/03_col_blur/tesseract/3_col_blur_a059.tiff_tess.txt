“ Oh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that
I might weep day and night for the slain of my people.”

A book has been written and published in Japan, its tithe “ Niku Dan”
translated into English, reads, “ Human s." This littl Look, a
narrative of the siege of Port Arthur, after being read through the length
aml breadth of the empire, found translators to translate it into the best
known of languages ; and its young author, himself an actor in the siege,
was summoned to the presence of his sovereign to be thanked and praised.
— isa cree deadly of on J ean siege in history, wherein

acknowledgement of ics merit a page on. which is a the a

farshal's appreciation, and another page bearing the Commanding Genera "s-
commendation.

In simple narrative the author carries the reader through appalling
scenes of horror, and as we read we are made to realize the slaughter of
the enemy's machine guns, of their ground-mines, clectric-wire entangle:
ments, and exploding shells we are made to hear the roar of the artillery
fire dealing death and destruction, and there rises before us the mental vision
of the fierce hand to hand conflict, and the dead and dying lying thickly in
the dark ravine.

“ For hill and battle plain,
= dying men eek shun,

rew mountain heights of pain,
And mine is boundless woe.”

a grim warrior who stormed lage the most impreyoable fortress
in the world gives expression to his feclings on his own great achicvement,
in sacklest words.

“And mine is boundless woe,”

For the grim warrior’s heart is deft in twain for the human bullets that

under his command hurled themselves to their death.
