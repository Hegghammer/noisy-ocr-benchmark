ROBIN HOOD *%9
more pleasant to consider the romantic spirit that
evolved him and gave him his exquisite setting
of mossy glades and giant oaks, where the sun
comes in golden-green shafts through the em-
bowering foliage, and you hear the winding of
the hunters’ horns in chase of the deer. There
is a springtime gladness in the old verses, of
which this is typical :

Whan shaws bene abeene and shroddes fall fayre,

And leaves both large and long»,

tts merry walking in the fayre forria

To bear the small birds songe.

To se the dere draw to the dale,

And leve the hillés hee,

And shadow hem in the levés grene,

Under the grene-wode tre.
It is the springtime of the year and of the
English nation that you glimpse in these lines;
a picture of that larger rural England of possible
adventure, and uncontaminated skies that is now
a thing of the past.

Nature is portrayed in these ballads with a
vividness and certainty that more ambitious poets
cannot match :

The woodweele sang and wohl not cons,
Sitting upon the spraye,
See lowde, he wakened Robén Hod,
In the greenwood where he lay.
It is versification of the simplest and the most
sincere kind.

Robin Hood, real or imaginary character, has
himself no criminal taint, but he is one of the
vou. & 4
