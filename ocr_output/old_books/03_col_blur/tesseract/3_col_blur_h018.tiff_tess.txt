It is sakd that Marnalas Horton I. was large in watere, and of a
ruddy complexion, amd of Gime social qualities

His tomlatone is of English bloc marble, five feet long and about
three feet wile. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It is chevater! about cighteen inches from the grouml, on a good sone
base. ‘The original bose was of brick, bet it had all crambled down
many years ago. The present base was pat ander the Mome at the
time it was re-letterad by Jonathan G. Horton.

The imecription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads ax
follows :

™ Dhewe Beth bared the beety of Ma. Masxanae Ilomrow, whe was boom of
Moaely, Letomterdare, O84 Bingham, amd decd ot Southold, om the ayth day of
Jely, 1680, aged So yours.”

In the centre of the stone we find the Epitaph, as follows:

™ Dew thew amy Rewby tombe! io dae .
"TV Chwiet shall comme to rebee ct with the oy ®
My won! aecemdied to the throme of Goel,

Dhaba. abs 4" Ihe bering Goad, pet eqemleth.”

It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with the imwription, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. Ile was the only ome of the original _
thirteen who brought his tomlatone with him, and this Get seems to
indicate a commendable deurc to we that his name and memory
shouk! not perish from the carth.
