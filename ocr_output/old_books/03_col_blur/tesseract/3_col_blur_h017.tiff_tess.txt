PREFACE—INTRODUCTION

We give Baax seas Howrow as the Profece and Introdection to this
litthe volume of Chronicle. He was probably the wn of Jowph
Horton, of Leicotershire, England, and born in the litth hamlet of
Mously of that shire. Of bis history before he came to America very
little is known. He came over in the ship “‘ Sww/lew,"’ in 1635-38.
He landed at Hampton, Maw. How long he remained at Hampton
ik not known. at in 1640 we find him with his wife and two chil-
dren in New Haven, Conn., in company with the Rev. John Youngs,
William Welles, Eixq., Peter Hallock, John Tuthill, Richart Terry,
Thomas Mapes, Matthias Corwin, Robert Ackerly, Jacob Corey, Joha :
Conklin, aac Arnold, and John Badd, and on the 21a day of
Oct., 16.40, auiuted by the venerable Kev. John Davenport and Gov.
Eaton, they organized themmetves into a Congregational Church, and
sailed to the cast em! of Long Isdand, now Southold. They had all
been members of Puritan churches in England, and all had familic
with them except Peter Hallock. They doultlow had been on the
island previous to this time and looked! ont their homes. On nearing
the shore they cau lots to decile who should firs set foot on the land. :
The lot fell on Peter Hallock, and the place where he stepped upon
the land has ever since been known as Hallock’s Landing.

On coming ashore, they all knack down and engaged in prayer,
Peter Hallock leading, as had been determined by the lot. Thee
were the fir person: of any civilized nation that had ever attempted
to settle on the east end of Long bland. Sv Grgla’s Jowrmal.

Barnabas Horton was a man of deep-toned picty, and a warm advo-
cate of civil and religion: froxtom. He was ome of the most promi-
nent and influential men of Southold. He was for many year a
magistrate, and several times a member of the General Court at New
Haven and Harford. He built the fra framed dwelling-home ever
erected on the cat of Long Island, and that home is still (1875)
standing and occupicd. It is a shingle-home, that is, shingle are
tied for weather-bourtls, and the sides have never been rovhingled,
amd the roof bat once, according to the statement of Jonathan Gold-
smith Horton, the last Horton occupant of the okt home.
