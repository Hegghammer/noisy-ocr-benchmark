It is said that Barnabos Horton I. was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities
His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone
was re-lettered about filty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It is elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. The original base was of brick, but it had all crumbled down
many years ago. The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Horton.
The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads des
follows:
Here Neth burled the body of Ma. HORTON, who was borm at
Momiely, Leicestershire, Old England, and died at Southold, om the day of
July, 1680, aged So years."
In the centre of the stone we find the Epitaph, as follows:
*
- Here lies my bodly in duit
"TIII Christ shall comme to it with the just:
My som ascended to the thurome of God,
Wheve with Jesus morm I make alsode
Then alter my dearest wille,
To be of this tife:
And you, dear childrem, all follow the Lond,
Hem and obsy His public ancred word:
Amd in your home call ugon manne,
For of 1 have advised you to the
Them God will bless yom with your childrem all,
Amd to this place He will you call."
Hels si I - He bring dend, yet
It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it. to
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the original
thirteen who brought his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and memory
should not perish from the earth.
