PREFACE
from Smith, the himself toas prone to include
the most extraragent myths in his pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE LIVES AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAMOUS
HIGHWAYMEN. Both of thew include pirates and
murderers. Of the "truth" of mich in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.
No one has ever reprinted those mithors in
their original extraeagance, or their grossness.
Il toould be impossible; and, if possible, il sould
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ecer edited
them, or ecen scritteu an independent history of
the When ice consider hote astonial-
ingly popular those romauces have ever beeu
schich have had Clande Du Vall, and Turpin,
and their like for heroes, this is not " little
surprising.
Perhaps the task has been abondoned because
of the diflienlly-the almost insuperable difliculty
of sifting fact from fiction, and becmise of "
chilling seuse that it would be " thankless toak
to preseut the hightengman as he really : a
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
ernel, and often No noveliat could
be likely to thank the frank historiau for this dis-
service; and I do not think the historian scho came
to the subject in this cold scientific spiril of a
demonstrator in surgery could be widely rend.
