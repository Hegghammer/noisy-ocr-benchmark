DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE
I have thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested witnesses.
- Weare having a perfoctly hideons time here. Thousands have been murdered-25,000
in this province they ray : but the number is probally greater, for every Christian village
vass wiped ont In Adama about 5000 have perishol. After Turks and Armenians had
made the Turks came in the night with hose and kerovene. and set fire to what remainol
ofthe Armenian quarter. Next day the French and Armenian schools were fired Nearly every.
one in the Armenian school perished, anybody trying to cicape being shot down by thesoldiers.
- The Turkish Authorities do mothing except arrest unoffending Armenians, from whom
by torture they extort the most fanciful confersions. Even the wounded are not male from
their injustice. A man being carried in to the yesterday when he was seizol and taken
off to gaol. 1 dare not think what his fate may be.
- For fiends incaruate commend me to the Turks Nobody is safe from them. They
murder babies in front of their mothers : they half murder men, and violate the wives while
the husbands are lying there dying in pools of blood."
- The authorities did mothing, and the soldiers were worse than the cround, for they were
better One homse in our quarter was burned with 115 poople inside. We counted
the bodics The soldiers set fire to the door, and as the windows had iron bars, nobody
could get ont. Everybody in the house was roduted alive. They were all women and
children and old from letter of Mrs. wife of British Consul
at Adana : published in the London - Daily Mail."
IN THIS HOUSE 115 WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ROASTED ALIVE
History repeats itwelf. In 1895 Turkish soldiers fell upon seventy to eighty young
women and girls in a churel, where they had fol for refuge, and after outraging
them, barricaded them in, setting fire to the building at the some time, and derisively shouting
to their victima as they were being roasted alive, to call upon their Christ to rave them now
