Most of NS like to keep a few of the illusious
ice belieced in when schoolboys. Scientifie his-
torious have degraded wany of our nucient heroes
and exalted the cillains, for tchow of old NO
mad too thick and slab. Beliefs are being
nasmiled on ecery side. To abolish the traditional
courtesy of Clande Du Vall or the considerate
conduct of Captain Hind therefore, be
strokes of the makindest, and I huce here attempted
no such iconoclasm Even there I cannot be-

of all such things in the beginning of the mine-

a half-told tale. But it corth the doing.
Only in respect of the great figure Turpin has
always made, has it been found really necessary
to seriously consider and re-state the career of
that unch-overrated sconndrel, and to put him
in his proper place : " cery much lower one
than he usnally occupies.
