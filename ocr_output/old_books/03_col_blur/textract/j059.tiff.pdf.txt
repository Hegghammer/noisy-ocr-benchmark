CHAPTER VI
AND SPUNT WEAVING
Rends which are used extensively for busket-enaking and
in general are procured from the of palm described in Chap-
ber I. These ahould mon be comfused with the term end
applied to several distinet species of large water lowing grawns
Such rends are usually designated under the numme of grases There
are a species of palm distributed aner the trogical regions
of the entire wurld, but only a few are mative in the United States,
and these are of no distince commercial valur, The ratitam or cume
of India and the Malay Islands grow to am height,
and are imported inito this country in great quantities These rait-
tamo and the trailing palim of the species Colomes have as main
export combers Singagione and Calcutta, These are stripged
of leaves and bark and split imito round and flat strips of different
diammeters and widths, The outer burk, whan stripged proger
sines, is known an chair came: the entire palimi, with
is commencially as rattam and the far rends are frequently
sold an fat rattam and pith came. these flat and round
stript, split foum the gulm plant and exported under the insurme of
rattum are called rends, we shall refer to them umder that name in
all discussions to follow. There are qualities of end on the
markert sold under the names of Chima end and German rend. The
former is inferior in quality and the latter in superior, bring strong,
sough and durable. The Islands give promise of pro
ducing a Liberal supply of rend of goed quality that is claimed to
the Germam product. The problem, is ome of gath-
ering and marketing the product, The government has made a
partial survey of the supply, and this justifies the belief that
the Inlamds will eventually compete with the world market.
