Thus, near the end of last December, one of a eentury's greatest
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people-slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or The Ouly-Begotten
is Descendod." From the window of a neighboring be might looked the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were nom all eut cloie and huried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mase of whirling and hurricane that hid the
cone of Ararat. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last pudille of the Deluge On the
shore of that Inke, eighty-seren years agno, Khrimian was horm. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was will undiminished by nea or land: the Sultan still counted au one of the formaid-
able Pomers of Europe. It was four vears before Byrom set out to deliver Grence from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champaon of
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Near East. Long and
had been the life upona which the Katholikos pow looked back, but not unhappy, for
from first to last it bad been by one absorbing and unselfi-h sim-the freedom and
regencration of his people. It is trae he bad failed
From his carliest years, when be hand witnesed the ternuts of Turkish oppression in the
homes of Armenians round Ararat, be was possessed by the spirit of nationality-such a
spirit as ouly kindles in oppreseed racos, best dies awny into tolerance among the
prosperons and contented of the world. He begam as a poel, wandering far and through
the Turkish, Pervian, and Rassian sections of Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jernsulens,
and recalling to his people by his pocins the soenes and glories of their national history.
Entering the monastic order after his wife's dentl, be devoted to the building of schoolt,
which be generously threw open to Kurds, the bereditary of Armenians. For many
years, while Europé was occupied with Crimenn wars, Austrian ware, or Freneh and German
ware, we ane hiss journeying from Van to Constantimople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though contionally defented, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up. bis of the Hod hung in mockery the necks

bis office after four years.
But the cup of Turkish iniquity was Gilling. The pitiless shaughter of Bulgazions and
Armeniati alike was more than even the Eurogean Powers could stand. With varied motives,
Husia sent her armics to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople and Khrimian found
himielf summoned to péenal his people's before the Congress of Berlin. Though be
spenks no language but Armenian and Turkish, be visited all the great courts of Europe
heforchand, urging them to create an autonomota neutral state for Artuenia, as they had
done with for the Lebanou. In London be becume acquainted with Gladstone : but
Gladstone was them only the blazing firebenud which had kimilled the beurt of England, and,
in the Congresa itself Khrimian could gain mothing for his people beyond the promiser of
Article 61, plodging the and especially England, to hold the Kunds in chock and
enforce Turkey's definite reforms. It - needless to say that none of these promisos and
pledges were observol. Beaconsfield returned to London amid shouts of - Penco with Honor,"
and Anmenia was left to atew.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople au prisomer, banished to Jerualent for
rebellion, and finally choren Katholikos, or head of his Churels and race, by his own people,
maintained the hopelcas contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last inculculable
crime (1894-1896), the Ampenians were alaughtered like sheep from the Borporus to Lake
