“Oh that iny head were waters and imine eyes a fountain of tears, that
I might weep day and night for the slain of my people.”

A book has been written and published in Japan, its tide “ Niku Dau”
translated into English, reads, “Tluman Bullets.” This litle Look, a
narrative of the siege of Port Arthur, after beme read through the length
and breadth of the empire, found translators to translate it into the best
known of languaves; and its youne anthor, Iimsclf an actor in the siege,
was summoned to the presence ot his sovercien to be thanked and praised.
The book is a graphic narrative of the most terrible sicve in history, wherein
is vividly portrayed the deadly sirugele of the besiegers. It contains as an
acknowledgement of its merit, a page on which ts recorded the Iield
Marshal's appreciation, and another page bearing the Commanding General's -
commendation.

In simple narrative the author carries the reader through appatling
scenes of horror, and as we read we are made to realize the slaughter of
the enemy’s machine guns, of their ground-mincs, clectric-wire entanyle-
ments, and cxploding shells; we are made to hear the roar of the artillery
tire dealing deatn and destruction, and there rises before us the mental vision
of the fierce hand to hand couitlict, and the dead and dying Jying thickly in
the dark ravine,

Por hill and bate plain,
With dyine men and slain,
Grew mountain heights of pain,
o : 1 ”
And imine is boundless woe.

Vhe grim warrior who stormed and took the most impreynable fortress
in the world gives expression to his feclings on his own great achievement,
in saddest words.

“And mince is boundless woe,”

Vor the erin warrior’s heart is elett in twain for the human builets that

under his command hurled themselves to dicir death.
