thickness and width. Factories use a very simple motor driven
machine for making the strips, and any manual training shap can
devise some scheme for accomplishing this work. hese strips cut
in indefinite Jengths must be made pliant by a thora soaking just
previous to use. In weaving they should be pressed close together
with the fingers or with the aid of a hammer, as there ts an appreci-
able shrinkage especially in their width upon drying. Such strips
are used mainly by builders of rustr: outdoor and porch furniture
fur the weaving of the backs, arms and seats of chatss, and have
at present no general use in school shops, Their use here should
be encouraged, If bough of the manufacturer these strips cost 40
