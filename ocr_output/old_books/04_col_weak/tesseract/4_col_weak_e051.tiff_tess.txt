THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE, Ss
Fairies, and attendant ladies are described. OF two of the latter it

«CT heir kirtles were of rede cendel,*
| J Jaced smialle, jolly’, and well? }
| Phere might none gayer go.”
| In the French version of the same poem it ts, we read, more fully
| expressed, Tt says, “They were richly habited and very tightly laced.”
The Lady Triamore is thus desertbed :— j
“The lady was ina perple pall, ~
With pont] bodye and middle small” |
Wharton quotes from an ancient poem, which he believes to date as
far back as 1200, in which a lover, speaking of the object of his
admiration, thus throws down the gauntlet of challenge, and exclaims-—
«Middle ber she hath mensk small.”
The word mensk or maint being used instead of very or much. Some
differences of opinion have existed among writers as to the origin of the
word corset. Some are of opinion that the French words corps, the
body, and serrer (to tightly inclose or incase), led to the adoption of
| the term. Madame La Sante gives it as her opinion, however, that it is
| snore probably a corruption of the single word corps, which was formerly
written cors, and may be taken as a diminutive form of it. Another
view of the matter has been that the name of a rich material called
corse, Which was at one time extensively used in the manufacture of
| corsets, may have been thus corrupted. This is scarcely prcbable, as
| the word corset was in use at too early a period to admit of that omgin.
| Perhaps as carly an instance of the use of the term corset as any im
| existence may be found as a portion of an entry in the houschold register
| of Eleanor, Countess of Leicester, which bears the date May 24, 1265 :—-
