PREFACE, |
_—

Tite subject which we have here treated is a sort of figurative
battle-ficld, where fierce contests have for ages been from time to time
waged; and, notwithstanding the determined assaults of the attacking

hosts, the contention and its cause remain pretty much as they were at the
| commencement of the war. We in the matter remain strictly neutral, |
| merely performing the part of the public’s “own correspondent,” making
it our duty to gather together such extracts from despatches, both ancient
| and modern, aS may prove interesting or nmportant, to take note of the
vicissitudes of war, mark its various phases, and, in finc, to do our best
| to lay clearly before our readers the historical facts—experiences and
arguments—relating to the much-discussed “ Corset question.”

As most of our readers are aware, the leading journals especially

mteuded for the perusal of Jadics have been for many years the media
| for the exchange of a vast number of Setters and papers touching
the use of the Corset. The questions relating to the history of
| this apparently indispensable article of Jadies’ attire, its construction,
| application, and influence on the figure have become so numerons of late
that we have thought, by embodying all that we can glean and garner
relating to Corscts, their wearers, and the various costumes worn by
| ladies at different periods, arranging the subject-matter in its due order |
| as to dates, and at the same time availing ourselves of careful ilJustration |
| when needed, that an intercsting yolume would result.
