Thave thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, viven by disinterested witnesses.

“Weare havinea perfectly hideous time here. Thousands have been murdered 25,000
in this province they say; but the nmaher is probably oveater, for every Christian village
was wiped out [Tn Adana about SU0Q have perished. After Turks and Armenians lad
made peave, tie Larks eame in the might with bose and kerosene, and svt fire to what remained
ofthe Armenian quarter, Nextclay the French and Armenian schools were fired. Nearly every-
one in the Armeniun school perished, anybody irvine ty eseape beige shot dawn by thesalders.”

“YVhe Tarkish Authorities do nothine except arrest unottendine Armenians, froin whom
by torture they extort the most fanatial contessions.  Myen the wounded are not safe from
theirs injustice. A man was beine carried in teame yesterday when he was seized and taken
aiPte cul I dare not think what his tute may be.

“Bor fonds incarnate cominend me tothe Lurks. Nobody is safe fran them. They
murder babies in front of thelr mothers ; they half ardor amen, and vielate the wives while
the husbands are tying there dyine in pauls af blood.”

“Phe aiiogitives ddl nothing, and the saldiers were worse than the crowd, fer they were
better armed. One house in our yaarter was burned with TLS people inside. We ecunted
the bodies. The sulliers set fire to the duor, andoas the windows had pon bars, uohedy
