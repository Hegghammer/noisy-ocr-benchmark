VIE ARMENTAN MASSACRES AND CIVELIZED
HUROPE,
“Fear then ye Senates ! hear this truth sublime,
Vhey who allow Oppression share the crime.”

‘A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping ; Rahel
weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because
they were not.”

Tn the twentieth century of the christian cra, in the age of trumpeted
progress, of boasted and vaunted civilization, there is a Ramah of countries,
a desolated Kanih, blackened and calcined with the fires of oppression, and
over her desolated wastes there flows, tlows, continually tlows, ever re-
plenished and ever renewed, that red stream which crieth up from the earth
to God: and out of this modern Ramah, a voice is heard of Inmentation and
bitter weeping, it riseth up in its boundless anguish to reach the heavens, it
crieth out and will not he stopped, for it is the voice of the RKahel of nations
weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are not.

Ah! thon Rahel of nations ! to the cry of thy boundless anguish, to thy
lamentation and bitter weeping, Christendom and Civilization, the Christen-

keepers?”

Who that has read the history of the Crusades has not turned with
sickening disenst from the chapters wherein history has recorded the savage
barbarities and fearful excesses ef those christian warriors, who went to
Palestine ostensibly fired with the enthnsiasm ofa holy cause, but in reality
only to glut ip slanghter and gratify brutal passions. Lurope has, however,
designated her past as the ‘dark ages” into which she has thrust back, the
ferocious outbursts of religion, the merciless persecutions of the church, the
savage sweep of the barbarians of the north, and the unbridled tyrannies ot
despotic power, from all which she loudly boasts to have emancipated herself,
and like the evolution according to the Darwinian theory of the anthro-
pomorphal ape, to have progressed into the state of civilization, But
beginning from the last quarter of the nineteenth and on into the first decade
of the twentieth century, the horrors of the darkest aves in human history
have lain at her doors, and towards these horrors Hurope has kept up the
role of an extenuatingly disclaiming, a mildly rebuking sweetly frowning,
smilingly denouncing, Disapprover.

Half a million Armentans annihilated by organized massacres of the
most ferocious and hideous natures, and perhaps a corresponding number
