utilized on the two parallel rails, except those on the corners,
Thruout the seven operations it is necessary that the cane be ker
from twistmg by drawing the remaining part of the strand th
thumb and foredinger.

Step 2. The second step is identical with the first, with the dif-
ference that the other two parallel rails are wsed, and that the

canes run over the first set uf parallel

the second step.

Step 3. Vhis step is a repetition of the first two. The canes o
this series run aver the first and second series and parallel with the
first. As each strand is used up bind the end by pulling it undes
a cane, crossing from one hele to another underneath the frame
and cutting off about 14 In, from the cane. Fig. 5 shows how thi:
binding is done. The loose end at the starting point is tied in thi
war, and all subsequent ones should be tied as they come, thu.
avoiding interference by many pegs, and insuring neat binding.

Step g. The actual weaving begins with this step. Tt may b
done entirely by hand, without resort to the needle, but it is slow 4
work, The needle should be used. Start at a hole next to a corner
on either rail that has been used but omce, working from caned side
toward the open frame. Go over and under the strands necessary
to form the weave, turning the needle from side to side in order to f
catch the canes behind the point. When across thread the needle
with the strand and pull thru, being careful to avoid a nwist. Pull
the end down thru the hole, pairing the canes. Pull the cane up
thru the next hole; then start the needle from the apposite side of
the frame and repeat the first operation, thus pairing another set
of canes, Continue until all canes are paired and all holes used.
Soak the woven cane with a wer sponge, and with two pegs
straighten the strands of cane and force all pairs together. Small,
