corner, or until the seat is completed. This applies to square seats
only. “Phe end of the last strand may be secured with a tack under
the proper rail, er twisted around a strand underneath the seat.

Yhe strand is twisted as the weaving progresses. his may te
done with the palm of the hand and thigh, in much the same man-
ner as a shoemaker waxes his thread. If one leat of rush is used to
take the strand, new leaves are added by tying the two ends ina
square knot ata cornet, or wherever such joining will not shew an
the finished seat. When more than one piece of rush is used for a
strand the pieces should be of uneven lengths initially. One leaf or
piece ata time is then added. Vhe upper or top end of the leaf is
used to begin rhe seating and each deaf added is attached at its top
end.

Some expert rush seaters do not tie knots in making strands, but
add leaves by twisting the end of the preceding leaf about the added
one, “lke the coler on a barber pole,” as une old rush weaver re-
marked. Adding by cwisting only is dificult, and requires great
patience and dextrous handling of the material. In fact rush
should be used by the mure skilful bows only. Others may use the
excellent substitute, Aber.
