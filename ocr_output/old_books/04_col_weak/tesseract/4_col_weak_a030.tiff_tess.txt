The efforts of the Armenians, and the cntreaties of their Patriareh
Nerses had procured the insertion of Article 16 in the ‘Treaty of San
Stefano signed between Russia and ‘Vurkey in March 1878. In fact the
wording of the Article had been suggested by the Patriarch himself Te
provided the following stipulation for the protection of the Armenians :-—

‘As the evacuation by the Russian troops of the territory which they
now occupy in Armenia, and which is to be restored to Turkey, might give
rise to conflicts and complications detrimental to the maintenance of vood
relations between the two countrics, the Sublime Porte eagares to carry into
effect without farther delay the improvements and reforms demanded by
local requirements in the provinces inhabited by the Armenians, and to
ouarantee their security against the INurds and Circassians.”

What followed has passed into history. The British Government of
which Lord Beaconsfield (then Mr. D’Israehi) was Premier, and lord Salis-
bury Foreign Secretary, once more pursucd the old policy of baitling Russian
acorandizement in Turkey. Afraid that her own real er fancted interests
would thereby Lecome imperilled, England threw im the weicht of her power,
and virtually commanded the substitution of the Treaty of Berlin in heu of
the Treaty of San Stefano. ‘Thus the substantial guarantee of a natural and
immediate protector, both able and desirous of enforcing the protection which
the Armenians then had in Russia, was taken away, and the security of im-
potent words given in its stead, namely —

“The Sublime Porte undertakes to carry ont without further delay the
improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces
inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the
Circassians and Kurds. It will periodically make known the steps taken to
this effect to the Powers, who will superiatead their application.”

“Tt wtll pertodically make known the steps taken to this effect to the
Powers, who will superintend thelr application.” Wow this last proviso
could furnish feod for laughter were it not for the terrible tragedy involved
in It.

‘The insertion of Article 61 in the Treaty of Berlin, granted, or rather
scemingly eranted, by the six Powers of Europe, proved in reality, as sub-
sequent events bore out, an instrument of death and torture, It was as if
the reversal of the figures had reversed the possibilities of succour and
protection, and with the death of the Czar Liberator, the last chance of the
Armenians died.

The ‘Turkish Massacres of 1875 and 1876 which led up to the Kusso-
Turkish War of 1877 are historical facts too well known to need further
