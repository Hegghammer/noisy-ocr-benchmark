PREFACE: ix

Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions

we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific his-

toriaus heve degraded many of our uneient heroes

end evalted the villuins, for whom of old no

mud iwas foo thick and slab. Beliefs ure being

assitiled on ecery side, To abolish the truditional

courtesy of Claude Du Fall or the considerate

conduct of Cuptein find mould, therefore, be

strokes of the unkindest, and £ huce here attempted

no such teonoclesm. Reen where 1 cannot be-

liece, J have told the tule —iwhenerer id hes been

worth the telling—as it is found in criatinal

trials, or in Smith ov Johnson, and other ald

sources, decorously stripped of much vile lingeage.

for really, where much that seems incredible

mey be fully proced, and where the believable

furus owt gol vurely to be fulse, tis your only wey.

To continue the story of the highwuymen from

Smith and Joknson down to the epproaching end

of all such things in the beginning of the nine-

feenth century, is like taking up and conclucing

a half-told tele. But it was worth the doiny.

Only in respect of the great figure Turpin hus

always nude, has tt been found really necessury

to seriously consider antl re-stale the career of

that much-overrated scoundrel, and to pd hen

in his proper place: «a very much lower one
than he usually vceupies.
