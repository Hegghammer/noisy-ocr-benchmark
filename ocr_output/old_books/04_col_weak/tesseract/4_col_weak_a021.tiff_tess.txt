earth as other nations? Does Humanity, docs Christianity allow that tender
babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and butchered
before the eyes of their mothers, or that the cars of mothers should be rent
with the cries of the dyine agony of their murdered children? Does
Humanity, does Christianity allow that helpless women should be forcibly
subjected to the most hideons, the most loathsome, the most revolting, and
the most crucl ontrayes? Does Tumanity, docs Chrisuanity, allow all this?

| Christian Goveraments have organized a Hague Conference of Peace
and Civilization, bue they have. closed its dours to the cause ot a bleeding
christian race ¢roaniny under the yoke of the cruellest oppressors that the
world has yet known. Christian men and women have held up their hands
in horror at the Indian Jugvernauth; but alas! the political wheels of
