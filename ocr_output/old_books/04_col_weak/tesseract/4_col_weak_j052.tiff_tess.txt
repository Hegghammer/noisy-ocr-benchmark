4s SEAT WEAVING
Care must be exercised to keep the strands from overlapping im-
properly at the corners. “Uhe strands should fit snugly where chev
go over the rails. To assure this, tap them sharply with a onallet
used over a block of soft wood. “Uhis may be done at frequent
intervals er when several strands have been woven over each rail.

Fic. 42. METHOD OF FILLING IX CENTER.
Uniform tension on the strand is desirable and this should be dight.
As the work progresses the interior between the upper and lower
rows of strands is stuffed, “Chis is done with the same materia! as
that used in the weaving. The butt ends of rush are used to stuff
the seat of rush; raffia is used to stuff a raffla seat; craft paper to
stuff a fiber seat; and soon. “Phe packing should be done tn a thore
manner, for it builds up the scat and prevents its breaking down at
the inner edges of the rails, and sagging with continued use. A
shghtly curved hardwood stick about 12 in. long may be used to
advantage to do this work. Fig. 41 shows a sketch of such a stick.
Tc is 44 in. in diameter at one end and tapered to 14 in. by 1 in. at
