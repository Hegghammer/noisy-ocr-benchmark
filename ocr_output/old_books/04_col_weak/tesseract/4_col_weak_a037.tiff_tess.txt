No one doubts that a creat forward movement ts reaching its culminat-
Ing point inthe destiny of Asia. “The West has learnt its allot relicion (the
moral and euiding principle of mankind) from the East, and now the Jast
would fain learn the law of restraint and the law of treedom (the protecting
principles of mankind) fromthe West. Inspired by this feeling the liberal
Turks decidedly mean well, and they are animated with a sincere desire to
ensure peace and security of life and property tor the hcteroveneous peoples
under the Turkish sway, bute they themselves have had to contend and stil
have to contend with a tanaucal populace.

‘Yo the Mahonmnedan world at large the Caliph of Islam is the envoy of
God, the sacredness of whose person must be inviolate. Abdul Hamid, the
astute politician, knew that the security of his sovereignty depended on his
Caliphal rights, and his main policy during the lony period of his cxeerable

who expounded [his religion with the parable of the Good Samaritan, and
the precept of loving one’s neighbour as one’s self, we cannot feel surprise at
the fanatical outbursts of the followers of Mahommed, the founder of a
religion whose cdoctrines certainly fall short of the humane principles

Mnculcatcd by the Founder of Christianity. If authentic historical facts prove
to us that horrible and atrocious crucitics have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other rclivionists, but on fellow Christians of different
denominations, how then can we expect better thines from the Turk unless
some power or force restrain him °?

Christianity has now partly cmancipated herself from the ferocities
which darkened and poured the red stream of bleod on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at larce, religion is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite. :
