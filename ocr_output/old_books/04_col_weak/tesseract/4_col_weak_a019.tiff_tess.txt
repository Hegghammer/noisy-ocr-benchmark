INTRODUCTION
TO  2spn PRINTING.

My object in writing this litthe book ts to lay the hard case ef my un-
fortunate race betore the men and women of the United States: since it ts

vo into print. The human mind is staggered and asks itself the question if
even the imaginations of fiends and devils could originate such horrors.
Then this orgy of the hnman fiends is arrested. For the time being the
