WHY AND WHIITIERERORE.

In making a study of my race, [have found three marked characteristics
Intelheence—Tnergy—Industry. Combined with these three characteristics
is an intense Love of Nationality. We live in a complex world. In an
independent peaple these characteristics and this sentiment are laudable
Virtues. Ina subject people they are Crimes.

After Thad Jaid this bitter “Pruth to heart, I did not have to seek for the
Why and Wherefore of the Armenian Massacres.

The Armenian Alassacres stand without their parallel in history. The
Inman mind staggers to contemplate the fiendish orgies of which they have
been the victims, and no pen can deserthe the horrors: and this helpless
christian people are to-day in the same deadly peril as they have been since
the famous Treaty of Berlin consigned them bound hand and foot to the
mercy of their executioners.

Vhe Armenians may be led again ‘as sheep to the slaughter ” and the
work of extermination may be completed—Jesus Christ was crucified on
Calvary and the servant 1s not vreater than his Lord—but the work of their
extermination can oly be completed when the evil influences in the Turkish
lenapire have reached their culminating point. Hitherto the Powers of
Europe have by their jealousies and rivalries cultivated these evil influences,
they have watered them and made them vrow, but when their culminating
point is reached, they must re-act on Christendom and the natural
consequence must follow. Vhose who sow the wind, must reap the whirl-
wind. Tris in the natural order of things.

Lwill allow that Liberty, Justice, Equality, Mraternity are the watchwords
of Young Turkey, but Young Turkey is only a small minority; the creat
majority of the Turkish nation are not Young Turks.

The question therefore resolves itself into this critcal point: “What will
Christendom do even now?”
