saddle their backs and straitlace their waists to make them well-shaped.
If any chance to grow a litde plumper than the rest, they presently cry,

Strutt informs us that the Roman women, murried as well as
unmarried, used girdles, and besides them they sometimes wore a broad
swath or bandage round their breasts, called strophium, which seems to
have answered the purpose of the bodice or stays, and had a buckle or

| bandage on the Jeft shoulder, and that the mitra or girdle of the Greeks

| probably resembled the strophium of the Romans. The annexed

illustration represents a Jady of Ancient Greece. He also speaks of

the Muses as being described by Hesiod as being girt with golden

“mitres,? and goes on to inform us that Theocritus in one of his

pastorals introduces 2 damsel complaining to a shepherd of his rudeness,

saying he had loosened her mitra or girdle, and tells her he means to

~ dedicate the same to Venus. So it will be seen that the waist and its

adornment were considered at that early period of the world’s history

matters of no ordinary importance, and whether the term strophium,

/ zone, mitra, custula, stays, bodice, or corset is made use of, the end
sought to be obtained by their aid was the same.

Constant mention is made by early writers of the pep/us as being a
very elegant garment, and there are notices of it as far back as the
Trojan war, and the ladics of Troy appear to have generally worn it.
On the authority of Strutt, it may be stated to have been “a thin light
mantle worn by Grecian ladics above the tunic,” and we read that
Antizous presented to Penelope a beautiful large and variegated
peplus, havmg twelve buckles of gold, with tongues neatly curved.

The peplus, however, was 2 yery splendid part of the fady’s dress, and

| itis rarcly mentioned by Homer without some epithet to distinguish it
