CANING; THE SEVEN STEPS 13
apen squares are thus formed over the area being caned. Unless
the cane is soaked it will prove rather difficult to pair the canes.
~ Step 5. This step is the weaving of one set of diagonals. Start

Step oo. “Vhis step is identical with the preceding one. “The canes
are at right angles ta the frst diagonals. In this step and the
preceding one note that two strands run intu the corner heles.
This holds true in all rectangular frames where a corner hole is
hored. Ie permits the strands to run in as straight a dine as pos-_
sible. Tf it is necessary to turn abruptly to enter a hole it ts obvious
that an error has been made by the weaver.

Step 7. Puila cane of the same size as used in the other sreps up
thru a hole, over the binder cane and down thru the same hole.
A foop is thus formed and the binder sccured. Pull taut, then
