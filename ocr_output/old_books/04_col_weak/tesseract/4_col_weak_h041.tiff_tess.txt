next morning the shecp were gone, and Tsaac and his son Roy, went
ap the hill at Liberty balls to look for them. Vefore ther got herond
the clearing they found dead sheep seattered along the log fence, and
others dying. Nearly all the flock were killed. ‘They even killed a
lamb in the pen adjoining the honse.
