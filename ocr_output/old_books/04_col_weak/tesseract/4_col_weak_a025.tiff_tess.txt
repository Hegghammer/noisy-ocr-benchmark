Further in answer to Ahmed Riza Bey’s account of the Armenian
pretendus patriotards " in connection with the Ottoman Bank ; ft cannot do
better than quote from Mr. Bryce’s version of the story, and the massacre
that followed: ‘In the following June serious trouble arose at Van, where
some sort of insurrection is said to have been planned, though in the disere-
pancy of the accounts itis hard to arrive at the truth. Masses of Kurds
eame down threatening to massacre the Christians, and a conilict in which
many innocent persons perished, was with difficulty brought to an end by
the intervention of the British Consul. A little later the Armenian revolu-
tionary party, emboldened by the rising in Crete, where the Christians, being
well armed and outnumbering the Muslims, held their cround successfully,
issued appeals to the Embassies and to the Turkish Government to introduce
reforms, threatening Cisturbanees if the policy of repression and miassacre
was persisted in. These threats were repeated in August, and ultimately,
on August 26, a bandof about twenty Armenians, belonging the revolutionary
party, made a sudden attack on the Imperial Ottoman Bank in Constan-
tinople, declaring they were prepared to hold it and blow it up should the
Sultan refuse their demand. They captured the building by a coup de wadtu,
but were persuaded by the Russian dravoman to withdraw upon a promise
of safety. Meanwhile the Government, who through ther spies knew of the
project, had organised and armed a large mob of Nurds and Lazes—imany
of whom had recently been brought to the city—together with the lowest
Turkish class. Using the occasion, they launched this mob upon the peace-
ful Armenian population, The onslaught began in various parts of the city so
soon after the attack on the Bank that it had obviously been prearranved,
and the precaution had heen taken to employ the Turkish ruthans in different
quarters from those in which they dwelt; so that they might less easily be
recoonised. Carts had moreover been prepared ta which to carry olf the
dead. For two days an indiscriminate slaughter went on, tp which aot only
Armenian merchants and traders of the cultivated class, net only the indus-
trious and peaceable Armenians of the humbler class, clerks, domestic ser-
vants, porters employed on the quays and in the warchouses, but also women
and children were butchered in the streets and hunted down all through the
suburbs. On the afternoon of the 27th the Brittsh Charge a’ Atfaires (whose
action thronghout won weneral approval) told the Sultan he would land
British sailors, and the Ambassadors telegraphed to the Sultan. ‘Then the
general massacre was stopped, though sporadic slaughter went on round the
city during the next few days. The Ambassadors, who did not hesitate
to declare that the massacre had been organised by the Government,
estimated the number of killed at from 6coo to 7ooo; the ofneial report
