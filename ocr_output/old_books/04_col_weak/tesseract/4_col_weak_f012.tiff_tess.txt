vill PREFACE
from Smith, who himself was prone lo include
* the most extravagant myths in his puges, culls
his folio A GrxeRAL AND TRUE ITistory oF
tuk Lives any Acrions oF THE Most Famous
llicuwayMen. Poth of them inelude pirates und
murderers. Of the “truth”? af much in Simith
unt Johnson, the less said the better.

No one hus ever reprinted those uuthors i
their original exlranaganee, or their grossness.
Ht would be impossible ; und, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ecer edited
them, or even written an mdependent listory of
the highiraymen. When we consider how astonish-
ingly popelur those remances have ever been
whick have had Claude Du Fall, and Turpin,
and their like for heroes, this is not a litlle
surprising.

Perhaps the tusk has been ubendoned because
of the difficulty—the almost insuperuble difficulty
—of sifting fact from fiction, und because of u
Chilling sense that it would be u thankless task
to present the highwaymun as he veally was: «a
Jellou rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No novelist would
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dis-
service ; and 1 do not think the historian who cuie
to the subject in this cold scientific spiril of a
demonstrutor in surgery would be widely read.
