THE ARMIENIAN MASSACRES ANID THI:
TREN TY Ol SEIT.

Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of nrope at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the still more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel tn history.

In the Guildball at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of [furope,
but in the tnterests of [Inmanity there should be attached to that painung
the wordiny of Article Gt of the Treaty of Berlin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).

Tre was a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of “the
terrible stronghold of Kars,” universally admitted to be one of the vreatest
aud most difficult milttary exploits ever achieved, and the crowning success
of the Russian arms in Astatic Turkey, should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General: that although Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest, ant Armenian soldiers foucht, conquered and
died, yet by these successes not only was no amelioration attained of the
hard fate of their unhappy nation under Turkish rule, but that fate, hard
before, was made a huudredfold and even a tacusandfold harder,
