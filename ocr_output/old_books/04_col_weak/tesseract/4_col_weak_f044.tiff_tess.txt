26 WALFHOURS WITH THE HIGHWAYMEN

There are other “ Robin Hood’s Butts’ m the
country: his “Cairns” on the Blackdown Hills -
in Somerset ; ‘ Rebin Hood’s Bay,” on the York-
shire Coast; his “ Barrows,’ near Whithy;
“Robin Hood’s Tor,” near Mailock ; boundary-
stones in Lincolnshire, known as “f Robin Hood’s
Crosses’; a large logan-stone in Yorkshire, styled
his “ Penny Stone”; a fountain near Nottingham
that figures as his; “ Robin Hood’s Well,” between
Doneaster and Wetherby; “ Robin Hood’s Stable,”
a cave in Nottinghamshire; a natural reck in
lfopedale, Derbyshire, known as his “ Chair”;
his “Leap,” a chasm at Chatsworth. A number
of ancient oaks are “ Robin Hood’s,” and legends
of his exploits still cling to Skelbrooke Park,
Phimpton Park, Cumberland, Feckenham Forest,
Worcestershire, and the forests of Sherwood,
Barnsdale, Needwood, and Inglewood.

The forest. of Inglewood, in Cumberland, is
indeed associated with other outlaws as legendary
as Robin himself or as that Lrish figure of wild
romance, “ Rory o? the Hills.” Andrew Bel,
William of Clondisdale, and Clym o’ th’ Clough
are the great woodland triumvirate of the north.

It would be a thankless office to dwell greatly
upon the probability that Robin Hood, as an
individual person, never existed, and that he was
perbaps not even typical of the woodland outlaws
of old, whose ideas and practices doubtless fell
far short of the hallad Robin’s ideals. [t is much
