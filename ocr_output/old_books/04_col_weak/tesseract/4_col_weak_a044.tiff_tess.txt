THE ARMENIAN AMIASSACKES AND THE
ARMENIAN PEOPLE.
During a period extending over thirty years the civilized world has
heard of Lurkish Massacres of Armenians. Miassacres of a nature so
' ferocious and diabolicai, se hideous and revolting, that no pen could adequate-
ly deseribe their horrors
| Writing in 1896, Mr. James Bryce, in his supplementary chapter to the
qth edition of his book © Transcaucasia and Ararat”? makes the following
grave comment :-—

«Twenty years is ashort space in the life of a nation. But these
twenty years have been filled with sufferings for the Aruenian Christians
ereater than their ancestors had to endure during the eight centuries that
have passed since the first Turkish Conquest of Armema. They have been

The land of the Muphrates and ‘Tteris, that Avaxes vailey, where, as simple
and primitive Armenians will to this day assert in unshaken belie!, God made
man in His own imave, and the country round the base of Ararat, where the
ecnerations of men once more began to people the earth.

Once the land of Ararat was an independent kingdom until the tide of
victory rolled over it and conquered its independence. Hemmed round by
three Great Empires, Russian, Purkish and Persian, the unfortunate geo-
eraphical position of the country became the cause of its people's ruin.

It is of bitter mnterest to Armenians to know that Ararat is the point
where the three Empires, Russian,. Turkish and Persian, meet, whilst the
