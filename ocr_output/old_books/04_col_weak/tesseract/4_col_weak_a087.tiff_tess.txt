since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national relizion
of the Armenians, and they have cluag to their christian faith vhrough un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure.

The cathedral of Ntchmiatain built by Gregory still stands to-day ; it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, until perhaps
little of the original building may be left, bat ir still claims to be the church
built by the patrou saint of Armenia, [ shall here quote a passage from
“Historical Sketch of the Armenian Church,” written by an Armenian
priest 5

‘Owing to political circumstances the Armenian Patriarchate had at
umes to be transferred to metropolises and to other principal towns of
Armenia. In the year A.D. p52 it was removed to Dwin, in o93 to Ani,
in is4 to Rémklah, and in 1294 to Sis. The Kingdom of Cilicia becoming
extinct, and, we having no more a kingdom and no longer a capital town, it
was natural and proper to re-transfer the See to its own orteinal place, as
the entire nation unanimously desired it. /\ecordingly, in the year t441, it

* was decided by an ecclesiastica] meeting that the seat of the Catholicus should
return to Holy Ptchmiatzin, where to this day has been preserved the
proper unbroken succession fram cur Apostles and trom cur hely Vather,
St. Gregory the [luminator.”

I read the other day in one of the forcign papers published in Japan,
the following piece of news : ;

“Aa Armenian Church pronounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christian cra, has been discovered ina fair state of preserva-
tion in the neighbourhood of Bash-Aparnah.”

Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light en Armenian history.
