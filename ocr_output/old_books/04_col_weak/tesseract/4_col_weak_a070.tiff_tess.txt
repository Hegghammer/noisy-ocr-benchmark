hu
victims in thy Yildiz Niosk, found its way to thy treacherous heart. No
poisoned cup of cofice like the countless cups brewed in thy palaces trickled
down thy throat to end thy vampire existence.

Thou hast lived! Protected from the Nemesis of thy erimes by the
jealonsies and rivalries of great powers which thou artiilly played one against
another: by the combined forces of religion and plunder which thou cuaningly
wielded into one. Even so thou tivest! Peerless living example in- the
civilized twentieth century of the Priumph of Crime.

POAVEENTR.

Jn the foregoing paves I have directed my humble efforts to sketch out
what the Powers of Furope have done in the past, and how their actions
have retlected on my unfortunate race.

It is considered goad policy now by a certain class of european writers
to ascribe all the horrors of the Armenian Massacres to PIamid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as unassailable and unconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as a sort of superhuman being who swept cverything
before him to the consummation of his own despotic will. The reason for
this is not difficult to perceive. â€œPhey would fain disavew the part Europe
has played in the tragedy, and to do this successfully it becomes necussary
also to present Turkey to the world now as a paradise (from whence the
tyrant once removed) peopled only by saints and angels: so we have also
many roscate colored word pictures of Consutuuonal Purkey.

Vhe murders, deportations and imprisonments of the VPurkish revolu-
tionaries, or more correctly reformers, were uadouhtedly the sole work ot
Abdul Hamid and his palace clique, but Abdul and his imintons couicd not
have carried ont that hellish work of wholesale extermination of the
Armenians without the perpetration and participation of the Turkish

people. It is trac the massacres were originated and organized in the
Palace, the Palace clique stirred up religious fanaticism and race hatred, but
the co-operation of the people was necessary ; and the pesple co-operated
inorder te plunder and enrich themselves with the worldly goods that the
Armenians always knew how to acquire by their own indusury and totl; the
appeal to their marauding and bestial instinets met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work fora race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims hy about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
