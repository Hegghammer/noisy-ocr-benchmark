THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE, 29
| Oriental figure of speech, is said to have been ‘ravished by the beauty
| of her sandals.” Like the belles of Egypt she did not disdain, in setting
| off her charms, to have recourse to perfumes and cosmetics, and
; previously to setting out she ‘anointed herself with prectous ointment,’
| In another place Jezebel is said to “paint her eyelids ;’ and Solomon, in
| the Proverbs, in describing the deceitful woman, adjures his son not to
be Staken with ber cyclids,’ evidently alluding to the use of collyrium.
| The Jewish beauty owed no slight obligation to her Juxuriant tresses,
| which were decorated with waving plumes and strings of pearls; and
m allusion to this custom, followed among the tribes from time imme-
morial, St. Paul affyms that €a woman’s ornament is her hair.’ Judith
‘braided the hair of her head and put a tire upon it ;? and the headdress
of Pharaol’s daughter, in the Canticles, is compared by Solomon to
Carmel, No mention is made of Judith’s mirror, but it was undoubtedly
| made _ of brass, like those described in Exodus xxxvili, 8 as ‘the
! looking-glasses of the women which assembled at the door of the
| tabernacle of the congregation.’”
