Added to these important factors of racial charactenstcs, tnfluences of
religion, and long crown habits of the Vurk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this super-added evil, is, the
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, greater marauders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation of whose lives comprises
murder and rebhery, and who have through weary centuries unremittingh
quartered themselves upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits of their labour and toil. Indeed as the Hamidich cavalry which
was established expressly for the ETlomidian massacres was composed of
these Kards, it ought to be matter of speculation what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized murder, can now find for those habits in
which they were encouraved and trained to indulee by the Ilamidian
r√©gime.

Under all such conditions no hope of better days can be forthcomins,
no prospect of better times seems possible, for that unhappy portion of the
Armenian race whom jorce of circumstances keeps on the soil of the
fatherland,

The appointment of Christian governors over the provinces in-
habited by them nicht ameliorate some of the evils, or the other alternative,
of allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespective of creed or
nationality, would furnish some means of sclfdefence against the raids
and barbarittes of the oppressors; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christian peasant subject to Turkish rule, and living in the iidst
of his eneasies, must remain one lone struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Notthe most ferule
soll, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the most assiduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abidiny instincts, can bring to the
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
happiness, and security of life and property, which the law of all civilized
countrics wuarantees to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil,
