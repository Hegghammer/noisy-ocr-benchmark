having only her kivde upon her back. John Gower, however, who
wrote at about the same period as Chaucer, thus describes a company of
ladies. "They were, says he, “clothed all alike, in kirtles with rich capes
or mantles, parti-coloured, white, and blue, embroidered all over with
yarious devices.” Their bodies are described as being long and small,
and they had crowns of gold upon their heads, as though cach of them
| had been a queen. We tind that the tight-laced young ladies of the |
court of the Lady Tramore “had mantles of grecn-coloured velvet, |
handsomely bordered with gold, and Jined with rich furs, Their heads
| were neatly attired in kerchicfs, and were ornamented with cut work and
richly-striped wires of gold, and upon their kerchiefs they had each of |
them a pretty coronal, embellished with sixty gems or more ;” and of
| their pretty mistress it is said in the same poem, that her cheeks were as
; red as the rose when it first blossoms. Wer hair shone upon her head
| like golden wire, falling beueath a crown of gold richly ornamented with
precious stones. Fler vesture was purple, and her mantle, lined with white
ermine, was also clegantly furred with the same. The Princess Blanche,
the daughter of Edward IE, the subject of the annexed illustraticn,
appears to have copied closely the dress above described, and, like the
maids of honour of the Lady Triamore herself, she is not only richly
habited but thoroughly well-laced as well, Thus we see, in the year |
1361, the full influence of the corset on the costume of that period.
There is another pocm, said to be more ancient than even J.aunfal,
which, no doubt, served to give a tone and direction ,to the fashicns of
times following after. Tere we find a beautiful lady described as
wearing a splendid girdle of beatén gold, embellished with rubies and
emeralds, about her middle small.
Gower, too, when describing a lover who is in the act of admiring
his mistress, thus writes :—
“He sceth hir shape forthwith, ail |
| Hir bodye round, hir middle small.”
