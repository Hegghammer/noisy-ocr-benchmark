| 46 THE CORSET AND ‘THE CRINOLINE. |
a
| “lrem: Pro ix wlnis radii, Pariensis pro robas wstivas corsetto et clochia |
pro eodem,” * |
| The persons for whom these garments were made were Richard, |
| King of the Normans, and Edward, his son, whose death occurred in the
year 1308. So that corsets were, even in those early days, used by | i
gentlemen as well as ladies,
The term kirtk, so otten referred to, may not clearly convey to the |
/ mind of the modern reader the nature of the garment indicated by it,
and therefore it may not be amiss to give Strutt’s description of it, He
says, “The kirtle, or, as it was anciently written ‘Aertel, Is 2 part of the
dress used by the men and the women, but especially by the fatter. It
was sometimes a habit of state, and worn by persons of high rank,” The
garment sometimes called a “ surcel”? Chaucer renders firtle, and we
have no reason to dispute his authority. Kirtles are very frequently
mentioned in old romances. They are said to have been of different
| textures and of different colours, but especially of green; and sometimes
| they were laced closely to the body, and probably answered the purpose
| of the bodice or stays—wide Launfal, before referred to :—
“Their kirtles were of rede cendel, |
I laced smalfe, jolly& and well.” |
: To appear in a kirtle only seems to have been a mark of servitude. |
| Thus the lady of Sir Ladore, when he feasted the king, by way of |
courtesy waited at the table— |
| “The lady was gentyll and small, |
Tn kirtle alone she served in hall.” |
| We are further informed that at the close of the fifteenth century it
was used as a habit of penance, and we read that Jane Shore, when
| performing penance, walked barefoot, a lighted taper in her hand, and
| * Trem: For nine ells, Paris measure, for summer robes, corsets, and cloaks for the same.
