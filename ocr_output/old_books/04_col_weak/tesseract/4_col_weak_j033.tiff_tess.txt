different places on the seat frame. “This is the result of working
to rule, and is necessary to keep strands equidistant and parallel.
At times respacing at several places will be necessary, When it is,
simply redivide into as nearly the given dimensions as possible.

After the holes have been bored and cleaned the seat is ready
for caning. Stare at the center hule in the back. Pull the cane up

started in this manner. It is best that the amateur work from the

are the same as those described in the seven steps in caning. “They
never vary. The only new thing involved here is the shape of the
seat. Fig, 20 is a photograph of a chair seat of an odd shape, an
irregular ellipse. It shows the first step half completed. Note bere
that the fast strand skips two holes, one at the frant and one at
the back, This is necessary to keep strands as nearly the same
distance apart as possible, Fig. 21 shows the first step completed
