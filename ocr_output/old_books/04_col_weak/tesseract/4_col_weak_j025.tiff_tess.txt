is necessary before the weaver feels confident ot readily caning any
area of odd shape.

In weaving the diagonals tt is frequently necessary to run several
in one hole in order to keep the canes as straight as possible. Just
when this should be done can only be determined by the worker.
A diagonal should never be permitted to swing to any great degree
out of a straight line. A close observation of the photograph of

It may be done in many cases where it will nor be subject to hard
wear. It is neat in appearance and is much simpler than seven-
step caning. ‘The presumption should not be made that this weave
will jn any way supplant the regular weave, but in justances where
decoration is the object, and not service particularly, this weave
will prove sufficient and effective.

Fig. 12 illustrates a frame caned with the five steps. The dis-

show the weave clearly. The first strands are strung in, in the
same matiner as described in the seven steps. The second series of
