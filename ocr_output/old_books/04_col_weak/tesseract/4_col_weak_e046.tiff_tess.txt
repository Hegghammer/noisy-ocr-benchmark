38 THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE,
mother of Brutus, was presented with a pair by Julius Cesar, the value |
of which was £48,457, |
| Bracclets are also ornaments of high antiquity, as are rings and
| brooches of various forms for fastening the dress.
| Rich gold chains and jewelled fastenings were in common use during
| this period. The annexed illustration represents a Roman lady of |
| rank about the reign of Heliogabalus. Little alteration appears to have
taken place in the general style of costume for some very considerable |
period of time, and the patrician ladies concealed beneath their flowing |
draperies a kind of corset, which they tightened very considerably, fora |
| slight and tapering waist was looked upon as a great beauty in women,
_ and great attention was paid to the formation of the figure, in spite of |
| all that has been written about the purcly natural and statuesque forms
of the Roman matrons. On the conquest of the Roman Empire by the
| wild and savage Hunnish tribes, fashion, urt, taste, literature, and civilisa- |
| tion were swept ruthlessly away, and a long, weird night of mental — |
| darkness may be said to have reigned throughout the land from the |
| tenth to the middle of the fifteenth century, and we sce little or nothing
: of Roman elegance or magnificence of dress to distinguish it above other
| nations from that period.
