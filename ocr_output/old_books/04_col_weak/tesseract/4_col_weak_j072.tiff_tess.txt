wrapped completely around the rails, for otherwise it would prove

practically impossible to weave the area because of the thickness

of the reed. A winding reed as shown in Fig. 49 or binder cane
could be run continuously, inasmuch as cither is relatively thin.

Weaving with two kinds of reed will produce an area of pleasing

the center strand of these running across the frame. In this instance
ithe strands are even in nuniber, so the pattern does not begin at
the actual center, but a little co the right or left as the case may be.
Beginning at the center, count by twos, over, under and over, under
and so on to determine the number of strands to go over or under
