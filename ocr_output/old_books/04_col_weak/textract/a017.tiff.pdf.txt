returned to their mountain home, only to tind their houses sacked and burned There were
nine Christian villages which Clustered abont Kessab in the valleys below. Several of these
have been completely destroved by fire. All have been plandured and the helpless people
driven ont or slain.
" Can vou imagine the feeling- of the Kessab people as they climbed on foot the long trail
up the monntain, and then as they came over the ridie into fill view of their charred and
ruined dwellings ? Their stores of wheat, barley and rice had been burned : elothing,
utensils, diarniture and tools had yone ; their goals, cows and mules had been stolen ; their sill:
industries stamped ont ; their bchord charches to smouldering heaps. The bodies of
their friends and relatives who had been killed hand not been buried. And vet the love of
home is so trome that the people have >ctiled down there with the determination to elear up
the debri- and rebnild their honses. - from The Sackni Kessab, Stephen Van R.

As these sheets are going through the press there comes news of famine
at Zeitoon. The Rev. F. W. Macullum, American Missionary at Marash,
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet, American Missionary at Constantinople, that
12,000 souls in and around Zeitoon are dying of hunger they are wandering
about in rags, mixing bran and water, and cooking and eating it, if they can
get even that, Rev. Macullum adds, "The same story comes to us from all
sides.
ts we foresaw all along, from now on the distress will be greatest.'
If 50,000 were massacred, the list of those who have died and are dying
of homelessness and starvation will exceed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggerated. Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.
The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered in a nightattack
by armed Kurds, and the villagers are now reduced to extreme distress. Before
the outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeatedly appealed
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec-
tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It is
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
