When this book was written, the writer was
under the supposition then generally current that
the Armenian Massacres of April, 1909, in Cilicia
were instigated by Abd-ul Hamid and his Yildiz
Clique. Babikian Effendi, the Armenian deputy
who went 10 Adana from Constautinople to in-
vestigate into the massacres, plainly reported that
all investigations had failed to trace them to Abd ul
Hamid and his Yildiz Clique. Babikian Effendi,
as was L() be expected, died suddenly on his return
to Constantiople, but later on it became known
thatthemassacresot April, 1909, hadbeen planned,
prepared, organized and carried into execution by
the Constitutional Government of what has been
called "Liberal Turks" or "Young Turks."
