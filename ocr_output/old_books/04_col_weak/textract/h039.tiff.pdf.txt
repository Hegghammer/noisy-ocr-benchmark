the first family of white people who ever settled there. Here he was
again exposed to hardsbips, causing continued ill health, until his
death, which occurred on 5th November, 1833. Ile and his wife were
members of the Baptist Church. He was a warm supporter of religion
and a lover of good order in society, which he always labored zealously
and successfully to promote. He was temperate in his habits and ex-
emplary in his character. Ile never disgraced the name he bore. and
his virtues are worthy of imitation by all bis posterity. He and his
elder brother Henry settled near each other on Point Salubrious,
which is a neck of land running out about four miles into Chamount
Bay. Here they took up farms, hail fine fishing grounds, and raised
large families.- - Letter of Van Rants Torten.
