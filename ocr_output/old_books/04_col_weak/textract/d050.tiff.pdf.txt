"Now, hinnie, why for are you making fun of an old

Aline; "but look at his shoon; are they not fine,-and
his beautiful lily-white hands?"
"Look as if you never did a day's work, Joe," said
Silas, the reeve.
"Oh, no, he works with his brain, he's thinking," said
Aline, putting her hand to her brow with mock gravity.
"He's reckoning up his fortune. How much is it, Jo-
seph1''
"Methinks his fortune will all be reckonings," said
Silas, "for he'll never get any other kind."
"Well, we'll change the subject; there's going to be
a funeral here to-night," Aline observed.
"No, really!" exclaimed half a dozen voices.
"Yes, it's a terrible story and it really ought not to
be known but you'll keep it secret I know," she said,
lowering her voice to a whisper.

tones, "You know John Darley and Philip Emberlin."
"Yes," said Joe, rousing himself to take in the situa-
tion, "they are coming here to-night."
"They've a long way to come and they are not
strong," said Aline, "and they will arrive hungry and
just have to be buried, because there was nothing to eat.
Yes, it's a sad story; I'm not surprised to see the tears
in your eyes, Joseph, and, in fact, in a manner of speak-
ing you might say that you will have killed them, you
and your accomplices," she added, looking round.
