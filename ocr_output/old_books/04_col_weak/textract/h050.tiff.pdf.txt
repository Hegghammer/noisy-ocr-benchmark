Phobe Tompkins, and on the gth of March, 1820, we moved to Peeks-
kiil villege, where We have resided ever since. I bought some pro-
perty, and set itp the blacksmithing business. I succeeded well in the
business. In the spring of 1835 I entered into a o-partnership busi-
liess with Mr. Truman Minor, under the firm name of 6 Minor & Hor-
ton,' and went into the fonudry business, monufacturing agrionitural
implements, principally plonghs and plough-eastings. Our business
ine Transed rapidly, and paid lis well. We continued partners for
tiventy years. In 1855 Mr. Minor retired from business, and I took
