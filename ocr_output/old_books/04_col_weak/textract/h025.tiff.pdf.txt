NOTE.
The reader will see al a glance the plan of this book. We com-
mence with the Christian name. l'hen follows the parentage, genea-
logical dain, Sc., and then the Christian names of :he children and
order of births. In many of the early families the exact order of
births cannot be inscertained; but it has been approximated as nearly
us possible. The lineage is given in connection with the firs: member
of the family, The Roman numerals indicate the order of births.
The sons and daughters of the oid Puritan, Barnahas, constitate the
second generation, but they are spoken by way of eminence as Joseph
I., Hannah 1., Stc. The book contains nuch repetition, but none
too much 10 make it plain and casy to smely.
This little book contains the chronicles of only about one-half of
the Horton families louked up. Those whose genealogical data are
given only in a small part, and those whose correct lineage has not
been satisfactorily ascertained, are not included in this book.
