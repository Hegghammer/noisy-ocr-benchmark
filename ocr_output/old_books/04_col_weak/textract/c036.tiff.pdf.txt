And then, when it was the first day after the new
moon, we descended the black stairway that led
into the cave where the waters caine. There we
found a boat of brass that was like the boat that
came to the Western Island on the day when my
father and I were fishing in the pools of the sea.
We went into that boat of brass, and it took us
through the water, steering itself. We rested
on lonely islands, and at last we came to a main-
land, and there the Enchanter left the boat
to sink beneath the water. As travelers then
we went on. We came to a town, and there
my master bought for himself and me the dresses
of merchants. Then we came to the river that
flows toward Babylon. Men go down the river
in round boats that are made of rods woven to-
gether. In every boat a live ass is carried, and
when the cargo is landed the boats are broken up,
for they cannot go back against the current of the
river. And the cargo is loaded on the ass and
brought into the market in Babylon. And what-
soever the merchants buy in Babylon is loaded
