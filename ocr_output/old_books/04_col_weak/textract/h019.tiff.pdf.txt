MORE \BOUT THE (11.1) HOUSE.
It will be seen by the engraving that the old house is domble. The
westem part is that which was built by Barnatas in 1059-60. The
enst or two story part was built by Jonathan 1., about 1682. The upper
room of this part was used for a court. house for nearly twenty years,
as we learn from Thompson's History of Long Island, and some of
the old benches used when it was a court-honse are still preserved.
The old "castle," as Jonathan (i. Horton. its last Horion occupant,
used to call it, is in all probability the oldest wood house in America.

bearing the Horton name, living and dying in the some house, and
all born in it except Barnabas I., and his son Jonathan. We may go
to the castles and palaces of the old world, and search long and dili-
gently, and fail to find a parallel case.
With a few repairs, the old costle may yet stand for generations far
in the future.
It requires some thought and Fi iflection to realize the lapse of time
