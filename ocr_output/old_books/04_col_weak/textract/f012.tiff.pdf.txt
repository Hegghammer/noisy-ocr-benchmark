PREFACE
from Smithi, who himself prone to inclurle
the most extronagent myths in his pages, enlls
his folio A GENERAL ANJ TRUE HISTORY OF
THE LIVES AND) ACTIONS OF THE Most FAMOUS
HIGHWATMEN. Botli of them inclurde pirates und
nurderers. Of the "truth" of matcli in Smith
und Johnson, the less said the better.
No one lus ever reprinted those whlhors in
their original extranagence, ol' their grossness.
Tt could be impossible ; wnd, if possible, il acould
not be entertaining. Nor lins one ecer edited
them, oit ecen acritteu (112 independent Jristory of
the When wo consicler how astonisli-
ingly populer those have ever been
achich harce had Clante Du Vall, und Thrpin,
and their like for heroes, this is not it little
surprising.
Perhaps the task hus been ubundoned becnuse
of the difficulty the almost insuperable difficuliy
-of sifting fuct from fiction, und becumse of il
chilling sense thit it roould be it thankiless tash
to present the as he really "
fellow heroie, generally faul-mouthed
cruel, und often corcarilly. No novelist could
be likely to thank the fronk hristorian for this dis-
service; und Z do not think the historion the emme
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery could be widely reud.
