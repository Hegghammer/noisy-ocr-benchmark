It is said that Barnabas Horton 1. was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities.
His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone
was re-lettered about tity or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It is elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. The original base was of brick, but it had all crambled down
many years ago. The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Horton.
The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads as
follows:
“Here Heth buried the body of Mr. BarnahAS HORTON, who was born at
Mensely, Leicestershire, Ohi England, and died at Soutboll, on the 13th day of
July, 1680, ngut. So yunts.”
In the centre of the stone we find the Epitaph, as follows:
- Here lies my bialy tombel Audust
MT57) Chris sha” comm to ribe it with the just;
My soni ascende 1 to the throne of Choti,
Where with swaer Jesus now I make aboda:
Then hasten after nie, my dearest wile,
To be partaker of this lius-ed life;
And you, dear children, all follow the Lord,
Ucar and olay His public stered word;
And in your homses cal upon His name,
For off Uhave advised you to the same:
Then God will bhess you with your children af,
And in this blessed plece. He will you call."
Huh, xh : 40-
He being denil, yet speaketh,”
It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the original
thirteen who bronght his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and memory
should not perish from the earth.
