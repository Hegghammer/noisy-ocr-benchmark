When this book was written, the writer was 7
. ‘
under the supposition then generally current thac :
the Armenian Massacres of April, 1909, in Cilicia d
were instigated by Abd-ul Hamid and his Yildiz
. “ . , , \
Clique. Babikian Effendi, the Armenian deputy '
‘
who went to Adana from Constantinople to in- poof
. L: ,\e
vestigate into the massacres, plainly reported that !
all investigations had failed to trace them to Abd-ul ;
Hamid and his Yildiz Clique. Babikian Effendi, : ‘
as was to be expected, died suddenly on his return '
to Constantinople, but later on it became known ‘
that themassacres o! April, 1909, had been planned, _,¢ '
prepared, organized and carried into execution by -
: . ve
\ the Constitutional Government of what has been re ‘
\ called “Liberal Turks” or ‘‘ Young Turks.”
