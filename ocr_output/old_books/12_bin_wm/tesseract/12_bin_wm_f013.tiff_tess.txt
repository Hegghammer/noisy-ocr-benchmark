PREFACE ix

Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions

we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific his-

; torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes

and exalted the villains, for whom of old no

mud was too thick and slab. Beliefs are being

assailed on every side. Yo abolish the traditional

, courtesy of Claude Du Vall or the considerate

conduct of Captain Iind would, therefore, be

strokes of the unkindest, and I have here attempied

no such iconoclasm. Hven where I cannot be-

lieve, I have told the tale—whenever it has been

worth the telling—as it is found tn criminal

trials, or in Smith or Johnson, and other old

sources, decorously stripped of much vile language.

For really, where much that seems incredible

may be fully proved, and where the believable

turns out not rarely to be false, ’tis your only way.

To continue the story of the highwaymen from

Smith and Johnson down to the approaching end

f all such things in the beginning of the nine-

teenth century, is like taking up and concluding

a half-told tale. But tt was worth the doing.

Only in respect of the great figure Turpin has

always made, has it been found really necessary

to seriously consider and re-state the career of

that much-overrated scoundrel, and to put him

in his proper place: a very much lower one
than he usually occupies.
