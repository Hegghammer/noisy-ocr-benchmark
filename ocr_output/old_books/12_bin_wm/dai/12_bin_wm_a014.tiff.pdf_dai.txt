fell in overwhelming numbers upon the unarmed Christians. The Armenian population of
Antioch and vicinity were practically wiped out and the Armenian villages in the
Alexandretta district destroyed with immense loss of life. Hadjim, Kessab and the neigh-

Marash stained again with the blood of thousands of Armenians. Zeitoon was desolated. The

homes, and the residue of those who escaped massacre are reduced to homelessness and
starvation.
