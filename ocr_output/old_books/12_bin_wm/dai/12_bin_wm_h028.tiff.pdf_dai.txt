a Militia Company, and also authorized by the General Court to issue
warrants, and to unite persons in holy matrimony. In 1690-'91 he

tor. In 1695 he was chosen one of the vestrymen of the church, and

addition to all these dignities, he also filled the office of miller, and in
this useful calling he was succeeded by several of his descendants. He
had five sons and several daughters, only one of whom is mentioned.
