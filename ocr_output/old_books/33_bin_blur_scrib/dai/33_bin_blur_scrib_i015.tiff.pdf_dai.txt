Why kountetinlear and ghastly hate,
Remember that wer chow, and at some time,
Each crm e exacts its human penalty
Remember that tan's conscience and man's mind

Ujen whom fall the burden and the cure,
The anguish of old hatredy and post wrong,

Recall the natusta to their sense of shame
To those in banding war, to uval jesor
