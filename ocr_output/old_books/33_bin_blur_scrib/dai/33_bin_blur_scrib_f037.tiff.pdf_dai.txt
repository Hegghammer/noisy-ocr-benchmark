the town
was named, ne the hill staple "
og market, and his successors were often there
The wool market was the most important
Dunstable the monks long maintaining great
flocks of ko on the adjacent downs
The subles became only a memory, but a
memory that never faded It merely took on
another form, and in the course of time the name
of the town itself was twisted into an allusion
to the their leader It needed the col.
lusion of gross ignorance and wild legend to effect
so much, but the thing was done, and for cen-
turies Dunstable was, and perhaps even now is,
locally said to owe its name to Dan's Stable,"
a hollow in the chalk downs, pointed out as having in
â€žbeen the place where Dun, the entirely ima-
ginary leader of the outlaws, stabled his hose.
+ you doubt this there is the town seal to con-
vince the sceptical, showing as it does what is
said to be a horseshoe ta shoe of Dun's horse'},
but is really intended for a staple or hasp
The legendary Dan was a kind of bogey to
the children of the neighbourhood, and in John
most bloodthirsty creature
There we read that his first exploit was on the
highway to Bedford, where he met a wazzon full
of corn, going to market, drawn by a line team
of horses
We accosted the wazzoner, and in the
midst of conversation stabled him to the heart
with a darges He buried the body, and drove the
waggon off to the town, where he sold the corn
and the waggon as well, and then disappeared !
