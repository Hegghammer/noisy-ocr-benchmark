THE STORY OF EEAN THE FISHERMAN'S SON

I was filled with wonder when I looked on the walls
of the King's palace.
The Enchanter that day had put on the dress
of a merchant, but under it he had left his own
garb the straight dress that had the curious
figures upon it. He took into his hand the staff
that was made of two serpents twisting together,
and he told me that the time had come to go to
the palace and speak with the King
At an early hour, before it was yet market
time, we went through the streets of the city. The
soldiers let us pass through the Gate of Brass along
a way that has on each side great lions carved in
stone. We came to the palace, and my master
spoke to the doorkeepers and they permitted us
to enter. We went through the outer courts where
there were soldiers who carried naked swords in
their hands. And because my master gave him-
self out to be a merchant from far-off parts, and
because the King greatly desired to speak with
those who came from far-off parts, we were brought
into the presence of the King of Babylon.
