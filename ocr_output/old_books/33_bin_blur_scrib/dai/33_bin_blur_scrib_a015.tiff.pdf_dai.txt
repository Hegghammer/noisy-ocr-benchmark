DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE.
I have thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested witnesses.
We are having a perfectly hideous time here. Thousands have been mardered-24
in this province they say; but the number is probably greater, for every Christian Fillage
was wiped out In Adana about 5000 have perished. After Take Armenians had
made
peace, the Turks came in the night with hose and kerosene, and set fire to what remained
of the Armenian quarter. Next day the French and Armenian schools were fired. Nearly every:
one in the Armen chool perished, anybody trying to escape being shot down by thesoldiers."
The Turkish Authorities do nothing except arrest unoffending Armenians, from whom
by torture they extort the most fanciful confessions. Even the wounded are not safe from
their injustice man was being carried in to me yesterday when he was seized and taken
off to gaol. I dare not think what his fate may be.
“For Bends incarnate commend me to the Turks. Nobody is safe from them. They
murder babies in front of their mothers; they half murder men, and violate the wives while
the husbands are lying there dying in pools of blood.”
The authorities did nothing, and the soldiers were worse than the crowd, for they were
better armene house in our quarter was burned with 115 people inside. We counted
the bodies. The soldiers set the to the door, and as the windows had iron bars, nolydy
could get out.
Everybody in the house was roastel alive. They were all women and
children and old people.”—Extract from letter of Mrs. Doughty-Wylie, wife of British Conful
at Adana; published in the London “Daily Mail.”

IN THIS HOUSE 115 WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ROASTED ALIVE.
History repeats itself. In 1895 Turkish soldiers fell upon seventy to eighty young
women and girls in a church, where they had fled for refuge, and after hideously outraging
them, barricaded them in, setting fire to the building at the same time, and derisively shouting
to their victims as they were being roasted alive, to call upon their Christ to save them now
