was a race up to that time among non-Moslem/peoples which with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman father land that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman contutry as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who eng

the Ottoman Empire. Because a few among them justly started an agitation use our noble
and industrions brethren were being massacred.
What a
fraite cear! When
left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our menian compatriots Leing
removed in mangre tarts; legs and arms were hanging down outside, This lody scene will
ever remain ing
en my mind.
This shocking time of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a cursed absolatism, up to the last moment, grew wider. Even during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feelings which had been shown,
the awful events in Adana took place and the souls of all true Osmanlis melted into tears.
Up to the present time the deep sorrow caused by this event has not disappeared, because this
bloody wound in our social borly cannot easily be cured. While we fill our stomnchs with
choice morsels, while we rest selfishly in our comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans, widows hungry, naked, and barefoot wander hither and thither, and thousands of
families are fleeing from the fatherland, We are convinced that the government is doing in
work, but what has happened is so great a calamity that it can keep a government buy for
However mach sacrifice we may make, still it will be inadequate, because the
happiness of the fatherland depends on healing such blood wourds as these as soon as possible.
We are convinced that the government and all connected with it are persuaded of this as well as
ourselves. We must now wipe out the traces of the misfortune brought by a cursed period.
We must now comfort weeping men med chhose who do not
erstand that patriotism and brotherhood do not differ from each other. The responsibility
of the government for the Armenians is very great and very weighty. The whole Ottoman
mation is under obligations to protect this suffering race, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
mlarge part due to the blood shed by the Armeniaus, We thought that these truths
were so obvious that we preferred to keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary from time to time to recall the greatness of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people up to yesterday has endured only barbarism, and for twelve years
has been constantly oppressed and ground to the earth, and has given thousands of victims.
Hereafter we must work to assare them that the era of massacres has passed, and with all our
strength of mind and soul we mast quiet them. The obligation of the government to protect
them is also very heavy, because our Armenian countrymen live among wandering tries,
We must all assist the government and point out its obligation. It must be declared in
pablic and periodically that the one of the most important dudies of the Ottoman nation is to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and property of the
Armenians as well, since these are their sacred rights. Let investigations be ride and let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim.”
This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare disclose
his identity; and the account given by an authority like Mr. James Bryce
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as "les Massacres occasionnés par les aventuriers Armeniens."
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
