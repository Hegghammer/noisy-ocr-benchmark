property to the value of £5,000,000 was seized by violence, the Katholikos resolutely refusing
to give up the key of the safe where the title dels were kept (Jan, 1903).
For two years
the Russia thals played with the revenues, retaining eighty per cent for their own
advantage. But in the thean time assassination had tid the earth of Plehve, and the over-
whehaing defeats of Russia in Manchuria were attributed to the Armenian curse. Grudgingly
the Chuch property was restored, in niter chacs, and for the moment it is Russia's policy to
favor the Armenians as a balance against the Georgians, whom the St. Petersburg government
is now determined to destroy.
heupon which the worn old man, stretched on his monastic bed, looked
back that winter's morning. Singleness of aim has its reward in spiritual pence, but of the
fature he was not hopefal. He no bager even contemplated an aut tomon, Armenia, other
on Turkish territory or on Russian. On the Russian side of the frontier the Amenian
villages were too scattered, too much interspersed with Goorgians and Tartars, to allow

On the Turkish side, he thought, massacre and exile had now left too few of
the race for any kind of community. Indeed, for the last twelve years the Armenian
villagers have been crawling over the le of year to escape the Kurds,
and every morning they come and stand in nesh groups of pink and blue rags outside the
Monastery or where the hend of their Church and race lies dying. They stand there in
mute appeal, as I saw them, possessing nothing in the world but the variegated tatters
that cover them, and their faith in their Katholiks. Slowly they are drafted away into
Tiflis, Baku, or their Caucasian_vilages, bat nowhere are they welcomed.
Some of the bishops and monks, who form a counell and their chief, still look for
Europe's interference, and trust that the solema pedges taken by Eigland and other Powers
at Berlin may be fulfilled. The Bishop of Erivan, for instance, still labors for the appoint-
ment of a Christian governor over the district marked by the ill-ommened ngmes of Van, Birlis,
and Eizerou

beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change and are now limiting their
efforts to education and industries. One cannot yet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolutionary parties of "The Beil" and "The Flag." Of these,
the Social Democratic "Bell " follows the usual impracticable and pedantic creed of St. Mafx.
The “Flag,” or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at predni dominant, and at a
assembly held in Erivan last August (1906) they ad pted a programme of land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected layer If the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.
Whatever may be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
