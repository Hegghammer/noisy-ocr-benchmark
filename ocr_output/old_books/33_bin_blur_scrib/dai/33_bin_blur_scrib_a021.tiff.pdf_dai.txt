earth as other nations? Does Humanity, does Christianity allow that tender
babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and butchered
before the eyes of their mothers, or that the ears of mothers should be rent
Humanity, does Christianity allow that helpless women should be forcibly
subjected to the most hideous, the most loathsome, most revolting, and
the most cruel outrages? Does Humanity, does Christianity, allow all this?
Christin Governments have organized a Hague Conference of Peace
and Civilization, jut they have closed its doors to the cause of a bleeding
christian race groaning under the yoke of the cruellest oppressors that the
world has yet known. Christian men and women have held up their hands
in horror at the Indian Juggernauth; but alas! the political wheels of
Christian Governments have been a Greater Juggernauth for a helpless
christian race. It is by Christian Governments that we are made as the
filth of the world, and as the offscouring of all things unto this day." It is

and we each one of us being on the look out lest our separate political and
commercial interests in the Empire of your oppressors be endangered, can-
not regard you. It may be the deadliest scandal of Christendom that was
Christian Powers should be all gathered together, one against another, in the
Empire of your Oppressors, as eagles gather together found a carcase; but
really there is no help for it; and if you must die hideously by a hellish
extermination, why then you must die, and we have to condone your hellish
extermination, for in any case, each one of us must secure his own political
and commercial interests in this same Empire of your Oppressors."

and Bulgaria by the events of 1876 that the miseries of the Asiatic subjects
