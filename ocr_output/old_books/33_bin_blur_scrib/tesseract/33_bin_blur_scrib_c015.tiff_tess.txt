PROLOGUE
THE HORSES OF KING MANUS
Own
As for the youth who had tried to steal the white
horse that the King owned, he was bound hand
| and foot and taken into the castle of the King.
There he was thrown down beside the trestles of
the great table, and the hetuwan-fronrthe candles ~~
hat lighted the supper board dripped down upon
Tove And it was told to him that at the morrowâ€™s
sunrise he would be-skrin with the sword.

Then the King called upon one to finish the
story that was being told when the neigh of
the white horse was heard in the stable. The (
story. could not be finished for him, howePR)
because the one who had been telling it was
outside, guarding the iron door of the stable with
a sword in his hand. And King Manus, sitting
at the supper board, could not eat nor refresh
himself bees there was no one at hand to finish
the story for him.
