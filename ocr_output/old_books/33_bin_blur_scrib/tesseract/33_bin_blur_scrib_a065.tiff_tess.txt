Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the ‘Turk, we have also in ‘Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Ensre
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this super-added exit
large neigbouring bodies ot Nurds and Circassians, gscater faders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular sceupation nae lve comprise:
murder and rgbhery, and who have through weary tenturies unremittingly
quartered ii upon the industrions christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits ff thetYlabour and toil. Indeed as the Hamidich cavalry which
was establi expressly fer the Hoemidian massacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized murder, can now find for those habits in
which they were encouraged and trained to indulge by the Famidian
SNe nn

Under all such conditions no hope of better days can be forthcoming
No prospect of better times seems possible, for that unhappy portion fffe
Armenian race whom torce of circumstances keeps on the soil of/the

| fatherland.

The appoimtinent of Christan governors over the provinces in-
habited by them might amelorniercwhthanwwnibeuthmaier alternative,

allowinz the use of arms to all alike, irrespective of creed or
fationality, would furnish some means of selfdefence against the raids
ak barbarities of the oppressors; but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christianpeasast subject to Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his eneies, must remain one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and oflences of the worst nature. Not the most fertile
soil, not the most tavourable climatic conditions, not the nyst afsiduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, Ligh ot
Armenian peasant under ‘Turkish rule even a mydicum of Urft com /
happiness, and_security of lite and property, sie law of all civiled -
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer akd ler of the soil.
