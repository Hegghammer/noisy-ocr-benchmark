CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS, 5
No. VI.

Ix this Grocr by Mr. Epwin Lanpseer there is much of violent animal Expression, and
Character fades before it, or rather, is absorbed in it. It tells a story of the past as well as the
present, and is pregnant with a catastrophe not dificult to anticipate from the actions and
expressions of the parties engaged. A Fawn has been seized by a Lrorann, who has been
despoiled of his prey by a more powerful Tiger. The Tiger in his turn becomes the victim of an
enraged Lon, .

The expression of the wounded Leopard is that of painful suflering mingled with dread.
Together, they amount to agony. He shrieks while he submits. The Tiger is. still enraged and
resisting, though astounded with the power and suddenness of the Lion's attack. He is losing his
energy of resistance, and is beginning to feel that all resistance is vain. He roars with anguish ;
while his expression is that of terror, and indignation not yet subdued, Wn

The Lion, who has just made his thundering spring, appeayyeeffscrous of havilfe fatally seized
his adversary, and luxuriates fearlessly in his (ftogysathwith a powerful and just expression of
carnivoropseyiyvment.—Meanwhile the charters of the animals, severally, are faithfully aud
specificdlly“reprefented.

AlftgughAur main purpose be to exhibit rather a pictorial than a physiological view of the
subject: having descanted on the word Character, we shall probably be expected to add, at least
a word or two, on the leading characteristics of the carnivorous class of quadrupeds.
nAosaoulprwauucters of the Feline, or Cat, kind, are easily enumerated in the concise
language of the naturalists. Their heads are round; their visages short/ they have six cutting
teeth, aud two canine, in either jaw: their tongues are aculeated, the \pyickles inclining backward ;

| their cliws sharp, hooked, and retractile ; their ears small and acuminated ; they have five toes on
each of the fore-feet, and four only on those behind.
7 C Of this genera of Catsy we hore exhinne the four principal species, Lions, Tigers, Leopards,
and Panthers, of which the Lion is justly placed at the head—at least, the unanimous voice of ages
TASpronounced him to berbe king of beasts, and we have enthroned him accordingly in our Title-
page, (No. I.) They form a tribe that is especially and properly Carnivorous, being the only
class of quadrupeds that are exclusively flesh-caters. Thef€ jawsfare very completely armed tor
this purpose ; their canine teeth being very long and angulat, whlwntedggOf the augles turned
toward the inside of their mouths ; so that when Jfyrenimal hfs caused fem to 1 super ens each

them back without opening his mouth.
Their claws, and the formation of their feet, too, are eminently cpndufive to their predacious
