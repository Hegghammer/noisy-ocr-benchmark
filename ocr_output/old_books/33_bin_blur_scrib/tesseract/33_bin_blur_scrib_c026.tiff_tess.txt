THE B APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
I went (2, stood on the floor of our house my
heart was thumping within me at the thought of
what was before.

And there was the pot boiling over the fire with
a fe ERC Nérbs in it. There was Saba, my
mother, stirring the last handful of meal amongst
the green herbs. And there were my brothers,

| all older than I, sitting by the fire, waiting for

the herbs and the meal to be ready.

When my mother looked toward us she saw the

Tan from the strange boat. She thought that

some crime had been committed by me or my father
to bring a man of such high degree amongst us.
She and my brothers were greatly afraid, for they
were poor, and those who were high were harsh (
to them. But the stranger spoke softly, saying,
“Good-fortune has come to you from Hes
to-day.” And when they all turned toward him
he said, “FE who am very knowledgeable will take
your son with me as an apprenti¢e¢“tndPshall
instruct hie arts and crafts and mysteries.”

My néthtet said, “The boy is young, sir, and we
thought he would be with us for a time longer.”
