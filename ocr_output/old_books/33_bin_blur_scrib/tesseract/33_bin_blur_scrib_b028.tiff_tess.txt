G CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

and carnivorous habits. They walk on their toes: yet not so much from that habitual stealthiness
of pace, by which they advance unperceived till within a spring of their prey ; as because it is also
the means of that celerity of motion which is necessary to the very existence of animals that can
fleed only on flesh.

Their claws are exceedingly powerful; and they are enabled to draw them up into sheaths
hetween their toes, so as to prevent their points from touching the ground ; whence they are
called vetractile ; and those claws are, in cousequenee, always kept sharp, unworn, and ready for
active service.

The eves of the Feline tribe — of every face in nature a striking and important feature—vary
in the different species, and are capable of much alteration in the same animal; as instinctive
impulse, or internal emotion, changes the expression of his countenance ; and also from the
degrees of light which act upon their pupils. Of Lions the pupils of the eves are circular, and
not of a yellow colour, as has heen stated in the most diffuse modern dissertations on the
Carnivora, but black. It is the iris of the Lion’s eve Eales appear to be best
suited to nocturnal, or twilight, vision; and hen n rarel’Annts his prey while the sun
is above the horizon—perhaps Apver, ten pressed by hunger in an extraordinary degree.

The Tiger, on the contrary, wilek his prey by day as well as by night; and during twilight the
eqjour of his eyes is that of a bluc-greeu flame. [fa stranger passes near a Tiger in a menagerie,
he colour of the animal's eyes will sometimes alter suddenly, from yellow-green to blue-green ;
not from any alteration in the devree of light acting upon them, but frou mental excitement, and
from a certain natural facility of expansion and contraction of the eve-pupils.

Hence a characteristic difference betwee u the Lion and the Tiger. The habits of the latter
are diurnal, and he disregards night-fires: the Lion, on the Zonmtrary, whose eyes are not calculated
for the glare of day, cannot bear to encounter it a Yet these physical conforma-
tious are sometimes overcoine by the rage of hunger; Wnd hence, in Mr. Epwin  Lanpsren’s
contending group, the Lion is represented as attacking the Tiger although it be day.
