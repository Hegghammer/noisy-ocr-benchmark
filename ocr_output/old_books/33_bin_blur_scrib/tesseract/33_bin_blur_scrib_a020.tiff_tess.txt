smell of corpses is in the air, the odor from the carcases of the “christian
swine” reek in the nostrils of the Turk, he turns away, his jaws dripping with
blood, and rests to couch for a future spring. We have seen that sort ofan

end to the tragedy ofa tger’s victim: the tiger has eaten his fill, } eum
to keep guard over the crunched bones and mangled bits of blogdyAFesi that
bestrew the earth. So also now there is a residue Py fose that’ have
