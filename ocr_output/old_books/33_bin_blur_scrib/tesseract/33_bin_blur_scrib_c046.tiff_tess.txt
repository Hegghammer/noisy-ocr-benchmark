lifted itséHas though the serpents were rising
up. The dwarf covered his eyes, and cried out,
“O Magus!”

“Remind me of the second dream that was

dwarf said, “The second dream was the Dream of
the Laden Ass.”’

Tis those skilled in the signification of dreams
could tell me nothing—

“And yet the dream is plain,” said the En-
chanter, looking full into the eyes of the King.
“A Jaden ass signifies a treasure found — your (
dream is of a treasure being brought into y
palace.” (7)

“It is so,” said the ancient dwarf with the crown

ass is always laden with treasure.” NON
