The efforts of the Armenians, and the entreaties of their Patriarch
Nerses had procured the insertion of Article 16 in the ‘Treaty of San
Stefano signed between Russia and ‘Vurkey in’ March 1878. In ake
wording of the Article had been suggested by the a ia
provided the following stipulation for the protection of theedemenians :—

“As the evacuation by the Russian troops akthe territory which they
now occupy Armenia, and which is to Le restored to Turkey, might give
rise to ‘js and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good
relation, beuyeen the nwo countrics, the Sublime Porte engaves to carry into
effect without further delay the improvements and reforms demanded by
Jocal requirements in the provinces inhabited by the Armenians, and to
cuarantee their security against the Kurds and Circassians.”

What followed has passed into history. “Vhe British Government) of
whielaLocd Beaconsfield (then Mr. D'Tsracli) was Premier, and Lord Salis-

the Treaty of San Stefano. Thus the substantial guarantee of a natural and
immediate protector, botLebkanddusireumol coleccine be protection which
the Armenians then had in Russia, was taken away, and the security of t:n-
he words given in its stead, namely -—

“The Sublime Porte undertikes to carry out without further delay the
improvements ard-reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces
inhabited by the Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the
Cireassians and Kurds. It will periedically make known thysteps taken to
this effect to the Powers, who will superintend their applicagigh. 7

“Tt ill periodically make knowit Ue steps taken & Kh Tope, /

could furttsh food for laughter were it not for (Onde tragedy involved
in it.

The insertion of Article G1 in the Treaty of Berlin, granted, or rarfer
scemingly granted, by the six Powers of Europe, proved in reality, as pub-
sequent events bore out, an instrumett ot enh ard torture. Tt ws fs if
the reversal the figures had reversed the possibilitics of succotyjand
