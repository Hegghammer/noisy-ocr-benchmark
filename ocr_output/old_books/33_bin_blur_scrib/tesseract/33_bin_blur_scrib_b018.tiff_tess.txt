Two Covucnanr Lions, AFTER RupeEns, taken from his celebrated picture before alluded
. to, of the Prophet Daniel incarcerated in the den, The Lions are here supposed to be miraculously
held in a state of tranquillity. Here, too, is not much Expression, but an extraordinary grandeur
of Character, suited to the greatness of an occasion where the Deity himself especially interferes

nerves, has an appalling elect. —His brow is clouded, tho eh his claws are sheathed. There is a
possibility of a dreadful storm which may not be far diStant, and that is enough to stamp the
Tiger's character. None shall dare to arouse his energies, nor to encounter them when aroused.
