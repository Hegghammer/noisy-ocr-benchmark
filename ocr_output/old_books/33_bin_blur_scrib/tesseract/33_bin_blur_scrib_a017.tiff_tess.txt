As these sheets are going through the press there comes news of fame
at Zeitoon. “The Rev. FLW. Macultum, American Missionary at Malrdsh,
writes to the Rev. W. W. Peet, American Missionary at Constantinyple, ‘that
12,000 souls in.and around Zeitoon are dying of hunger ; they are wandering
about in razs, mixing bran and water, and cooking and eating it, if they can
geteven that. Rey. Madcalhinaads “The Stine Stary Comes to us from ali
gles. As we foresaw ali along, from now on the distress will be greatest.”

If 59,000 were massacred, the list of those who have died ard are dying
of homelessness and_stacuation will exceed 150,000. It is true; and the

ws
numbers are not exaggerated. Last year the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.
