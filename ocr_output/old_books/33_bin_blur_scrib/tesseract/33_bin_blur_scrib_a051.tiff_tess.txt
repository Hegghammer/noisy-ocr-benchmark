On the field the ever victorious army of little Japan undermined Russia‘s
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
defeated and ever retreating army of colossal Russia. At sea th Kew
victorious Japanese Fleet succeeded in completely annihilating: CMssian
leet. It was war such as the world had never y@t o— The secret of
such astounding successes should be investigated, ad here | beg leave to
quote from of a sertes of articles in which | gave view to my opinions
during Cini War. ‘Japan may be likened to the bundle of
faggots in he fle firmly tied togetner: one fiygot of larger dimensions in
the centre, the sovereign round whom the whole nation clusters, and all,
ruler and people tied together by adamantine bands of patriotism.”

These remarks of mine were based on observations of actual facts. In
national unity Japan stands as an object lesson to the world; she furnishes
an cxamplenetiette world needs to copy, and which a nation so politically
forlorn as ourselves more than any other needs to copy.

From the astounding success of Japan let us turn to the psi oe
Great Republic of the United States of America occupies in the world, and
take the lesson to heart of what Union can accomplish as we contrast their
present position with the position that the handful of puritan pilgrims occupied
when they first landed of Ato eat or HOC trier rete years ago.

National Unity is our greatest need: itis the banner which we must
raise up over our national life. National Unity must be engraven on the
tablets of our minds and throb in the pulses of our hearts. There are
mountains of difficiTtes before us, and if ever we must reach the goal we
can only do so by being bound together like the bundle of faggots in the
fable, with no weakening or loosening of the bands. Then/perlJaps we
might once more be able to get an independent footing on lif Pos SOT
of our fathers, and perhaps once more rally round our own flag CS /
ese_lives for the State, not for himself: we et (ape for which to dive; -
but let us live Tor our communities whilst we kedp thé hope in our hearts
that communities grow into States.

We have grit and endurance in an unparalleled degree, but thes
characteristics wiil profit us nothing if weamcercantwneunity.

Let us rempprbt? that utterance of the Founder of our faith. In \u
loyalty and aefiance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents of ¥
cataract, bu#wetfist remember His warning utterance :—

“What shall it profita man.” What shall it profit a nation. Unity is
the soul ef a nation. Let us keep our soul and not lose it.
