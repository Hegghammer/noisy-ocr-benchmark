8 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

the position of the head. In all gramnivorous «animals, the skin of the head is closely attached to
the skull, and capable only of very limited motion: the eye is almost uniformly inild, and the lips
unmoved by passion.

“Tt is in carnivorous animals, with whose habits and manner of life, ferocity is instinctively
connected, as the great means of their subsistence, that rage is distinguished by the most
remarkable strength of expression. The eye-ball is terrible, and the retraction of the flesh of the
lips indicates the most savage fury. But the first, is merely the exerted attention of the animal ;
and the other a preparatory exposure of the canine teeth. ‘The great animals of prey —the Lion
and the ‘Tiger —are quite incapable of any other expression of feature, than this particular display
of ferociousness. When they fawn upon their keeper, there is no motion in their features that
indicates affection.”

In this assertion, that the countenances of the great animals of prey are ineapable of any
other than ferocious expression, we do not quite atk ne physiologist. When
they fawn upon their keeper, we think that indig#iett> of affevon are exhibited; and find
ourselves rendy to ask what elseJliay kite 4*xpression is that “licking of the hand” whieh our
wuthor hus before mentioned. S however, we should grant that they may not be capable of
affectionate expression toward their keeper, we ean scarcely doubt that—toward their young —if

Fo could observe them in their will state, and in their moments of playful intercourse and
enjoyment among each other—they are: at least, we think there are motions in their features that
indicate affection, as well as fear, enquiry, surprise, gratitude, pleasurable wantonness, and some
other sentiments, or emotions. This is our conviction: at the same time, we perceive that the

Ne nef their ferocious expression far exceeds the savage cy of their domestic charities. Are
not even the least of these observable in the habits yes of the domestic Cat, who belongs
to the Tiger genera? But we have even seen a Tiger iNhis den, who looked good-natured enough
to be stroked and patted : aud of the Lion, of whom Mi. Grorvivir relates the following anecdote,

© Hearing some noise under his cage, the Lion passed his paw between the bars, and actually ,
hauled up his keeper who was cleaning beneath ; but as soon as he perceived that he had thus ill
uStPTsThaster, he instantly lay down upon his back in an attitude of complete submission.”
