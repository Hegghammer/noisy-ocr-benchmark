CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. 7
an opposite theory, in which instinctive agency is rejected, and the appearances are explained from
a consideration of the necessities and voluntary exertions of the animal. With regard to the
observer, it has been asserted, that it is by experience alone that he distinguishes the signs of the
passions ; that we learn, while infants, to consider smiles as expressions of kindness, hecause they
are accompanied by acts of beneficence and by endearmeuts ; and frowns as the contrary, because
we find them followed by blows ; that the expression of anger in a brute, is only that which has
been observed to precede his biting ; and that of fondness, his fawning and licking of the hand.
With regard to the creature itself, it is said, what has been called the external signs of passion, are
merely the concomitants of those voluntary movements, which the passions or habits suggest ; that

: the glare of the Lion's eve, for example, is the consequence of a voluntary exertion to see his prey
more clearly —his grin, or snarl, the natural motion of unceasing his fangs before he uses them.
This, however, is not quite true of all animals and of all expression of passion.”

animals no range of expression which is not fairly referable as a mere accessary to the voluntary

“There appears to me (continues Mr. Ber) to be no expressio& if the face of any animal
lower in the scale of being than quadrupeds; and in them the \yrongest and most marked
