denouncivy pxtests of those thoughiful men whose feelings of revolted
humanity Wve made themselves heard in sounding language, have fallen on
stony ground ; they have been like the voices of men crying out ia the wilder-
ness. Europe has turned a deat ear to the condemnations of justice and
teath, even as she has turned a deaf ear to the voice of Rahel weeping for
her sbyshiceh shillren.
