THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER

And (De way that the story of The Boy
Apprenticed to an Enchanter used to begin.

But first I shall have to tell you about King
Manus and his three horses.

King Nypuscaled over the Western Island, and
he had a castle that was neither higher nor wider
than any other King’s castle. But he had a stable

| that was more strongly built than any other King’s
stable. It had double walls of stone; it had oak
beams; it had an iron door With Tour To¢ks to it —

Ps before this door two soldiers with drawn
swords in their hands stayed night and day.

In those days, ifTone went before a King and
asked him for a gift the King might not refuse to
give what was asked of him. But King Manus
was hard to come to by those with requests. For (
before the_chamber where he sat or slept We)
stood a servant to take the request, and if it w
one that might not be brought to him, to make an
excuse for the Ning. ee

It was all becuase of the King’s three horses —

a white hops red horse, and a black horse.
The white horse was as swift as the plunging wave
