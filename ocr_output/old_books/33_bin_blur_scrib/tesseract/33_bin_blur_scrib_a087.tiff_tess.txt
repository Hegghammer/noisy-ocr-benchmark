Since the Ome of Gregory, Christianity has been the national relizion
of the Armenians, and they have clusg to their christian faith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian peaple
have been called upon to endure. on

The cathedral of btchmitatzin built by Gregory sAlgsmyt de to-day ; it has
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part <r other, until perhaps
little of the gef@inal building may be left, but ie still claims to be the church
built by thy Atrgn saint of Armenia. T shall here quote a passage from
“ Historical Shétch of the Armenian Church,” written by an Armenian
priest:

“Owing to political circumstances the Armenian Patriarchate had at
times to be transferred to metropolises and to other principal towns of
Armenia, Inthe year AD. 452 it was removed to Dwin, in 993 to Ani,
in tarp to homblah, and in 1294 to Sis. The Kingdom of Cilicia becoming
extinct, and, we having no more a kingdom and no longer a capital townfit
was natural and proper to re-transfer the See to its own original plack/ as
the entire nation unanimously desired it, Accordinghy, in the year rggi, it

‘| owas decided by an ecclesiastical meeting that the seat ot the Catholicus should
return to Holy Ftchmiatzin, where to this day has been preserved the
per unbroken succession from cur Apostles and trem cur holy Father,

t. Gregory the HHluminator.”

I read the other day in one of the foreign papers published in’ Japan,
the following piece FTE WS; .

“Aa Armenian Church pronounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christian cra, has been discovered ina fair statypf ppreserva-
tion in the neighboutheod of Bash Aparnal.”

Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which DLsofessor’ Mefr Gs prow /
conducting might lead to throwing more light on on history. -
