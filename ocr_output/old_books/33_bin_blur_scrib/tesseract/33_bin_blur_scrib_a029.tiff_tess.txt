THE ARMENEAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY Ol BERILEN. nt

Since the gathering of the Pleni; otentiaries of urope 2-ANT famous
Consress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the s Oe lamous Treaty
of Berlin, the yartyr roll of the unfortunate Armenti® nation stands withcut
its parallel & bisory.

In thd Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
Witnessed intimt city on July the thirteenth 1$7$. 0 Phe painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerful Governments of Europe,
but in the toterests of Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of Bertin written in letters of blood
(Armenjan bload),

Tr was a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of ‘thy
terrible stronghoid of Kars,” universally admitted te be one of the vrefitdst
and most difheule miitary exploits ever achieved, and the crowning stdgess
of the Russian arms ia Asiatic ‘Vurkey, shouid have been accomplished by

| an Armenian General; that although Armenian Generals ia the Russian
service had led to conquestawalyvaupprsadicrs eupbr conquered and
ing, yet by these successes not only was ne amehoration attained of the
fess of their unbappy nation under Turkish rive, Lut that fate, hard
fore, was made a hundredfold and even a tiousandfold harder.
