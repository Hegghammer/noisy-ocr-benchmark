CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

No. VI.
Ix this GROUP by MR. EDWIN LANDSEER there is much of violent alimal Expression, and
Character fades before it, or rather, is absorbed in it. It tells a story of the past as well as the
present, and is pregnant with a catastrophe not difficult to anticipate from the actions and
expressions of the parties engraged. A FAWN has been seized by a LEOPARD, who has been
despoiled of his prey by a more powerful TIGER. The Tiger in his turn becomes the victim of an
enraged LION.
The expression of the wounded Leopard is that of painful suffering mingled with dread.
Together, they amount to agrony. Ile shrieks while he submits. The Tiger is still enragerd and
resisting, though astounded with the power and suddeuness of the Lion's attack. He is losing his
energy of resistance, and is beginning to feel that all resistance is vain. Ile roars with anguish;
while his expression is that of terror, and indignation not yet subdued
ating
The Lion, who has just made his thundering spring, poliscious of having fatally scized
his adversary, and luxuriates fearlessly in his with a powerful and just expression of
carnivorous eniovment.-Meanwhile the charerters of the animals, severally, are faithfully and
specifically represented.
our main purpose be to exhibit rather a pictorial than a physiological view of the
subject : having descanted on the word Character, we shall probably be expected to add, at least
a word or two, on the leading characteristics of the carnivorous class of quadrupeds.
aracters of the Feline, or Cat, kind, are easily cnumerated in the concise
language of the naturalists. Their heads are round; their visages short they have six cutting
teetli, and two canine, in either jaw : their tongues are aculeated, the prickles inclining backward
;
their claws sharp, hooked, and retractile; their ears small and acuminated: they have five toes on
each of the fore-feet. and four ouly on those behind.
Of this genera of Cats, we here exhübit the four principal species, Lions, Tigers, Leopards,
and Pauthers, of which the Lion is justly placed at the head-at least, the unanimous voice of agres
hrss pronounced him to be the king of beasts, and we have enthroned him accordingly in our Title-
page, (No. I.) They form a tribe that is especially and properly Carnirorous, being the only
class of quadrupeds that are exclusively fleshicaters. Theit juws are very completely armed
for
this purpose ; their canine teeth being very long and angular, with the edgres of the augles turned
toward the inside of their mouths; so that when Mcanimal mas caused them to meet or cross each
other in the flesh of its prey, these formidable teeth will cut or tear a way through, by drawing
them back without opening his mouth.
Their claws, and the formation of their feet, too. are eminently conducive to their predacious
