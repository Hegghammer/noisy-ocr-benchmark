victims in thy Yildiz Kiosk, found its way to thy treacherous heart. No
poisoned cup of coftee like the countless cups brewed in thy palaces trickled
down thy throat to end thy vampire existence.
Thou hast lived ! Protected from the Nemesis of thy crimes bing
jealousies and rivalries of great powers which thou artfully plainal one against
another : by the combined forces of religion and plunical which thou cunningly
wielded into one. Even so thou livest! Peerles living example in the
civilized century of the Triumph of Crime.

la the foregoing pages ] have directed my humble efforts to sketch out
what the lowers of Turope have done in the past, and how their actions
have reflected on my unfortunate race.
It is considered goodi policy now by n certain class of European
to ascribe all the horrors of the Armenian Massacres to Hamid the despot,
to represent him as a tyrant as unassailable and unconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as a sort of superhuman being who swept everything
before him to the of his oun despotic will. The reason
for
this is not difficult to perceive. They would fain disavow the part Europe
has played in the tragedy. and to do this successfully it becomes necessary
also to present Turkey to the workd now as a paradise (from whence the
tyrant once removed) peopled only be saints and angels : so we have also
many roscate colored word pictures of Constitutional Turkey.
The marders. deportations and imprisonments of the Wrkish revolu-
tionaries, or more correctly retormers, were undoubtediy the sole work
Abdui Hamid and his palace clique, but Abdul and his minieds coun not
/
have carried out that hellish work of wholdsh extermination
the
Armenians without the perperration and participation of the Turkish
people. It is true the massacres were originated and organized in the
Palace, the Palace dique stirred up religious fanaticism and race hatred, but
the co-operation of the people was and the people co-ogerated
in order to pluncler and enrich themselves with the woridly goods tifat the
Armenians knew how to acquire by their own industry and toil the
appeal to the marauding and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
