CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS
DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.
THAT there has hitherto existed no grood book of Engravings of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the progress of the student in that department of Art, is to be regretted. The talents
of Mr. JOHN SCOTT, brought into action by those of GILPIN, COOPER, and the REINAGLES,
have presented the public with excellent representations of the distinguished ornaments of the
turf: the sports of the field, and the habits and mauners of the canine race, were also duly
honoured but of the ferocious TIGER tribe, and the lordly Loos, hav extant that
would bear critical inspection, beyond a few detached priute Thothing like a collection of
figures, whose justness and accuracy of character, and expression, might be
relied on
Does any reader imagine that the various Etchings which have been performed-chiefly
abroad br Artists of no mean ability, may be considered as exceptions They are not exceptions

by
those who have not actually compared them with the Lious, Leopards, and Tigers of Nature.
They have been taken too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
Nor
is this intended toinpugn the merits. as historical or poetical painters, of those distinguished
Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that as a painter of allegrory, RUBENS
might consider that strong infusion of human form, and expression, by which his Lions,
for example, are distinguished, as necessary, or conducive, to hi Intorical purposes: or, it is pos-

he
may have Iaboured under early prejudice of mind, or of vision, in this part of his education as a
Painter, and may not have seen Lions as they really are. This is what the writer is most inclined
