CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
the scene of which, by the way, he has not represented as a roval menagerie, but as a wild,
rocky cavern-his animals partake of the artificial character of which we cannot bring ourselves to
approve.
Of this fact, however, we purpose to exhibit proof with our assertion. Improved versions, to
the best abilities of our Artists, of some of these Lions of RUBENS and the Assyrian king, will here
be introduced, which the reader, who pleases, may compare with the originals. Our second, third,
and fourth Plates are of the number.
The Lions of ReBENS are humaniard. We do not intend to discuss at length whether the
ideality of allegorieal painting required this : we only state the fact : yet the opinions which we
felt at liberty to form on the subject, we feel at liberty to utter. So much in apology for using the
licence of asserting that the beads of many of the Lions of Rt TBENS rather resemble those of frowning
old geutlemen decorated with Ramillies wigs : as if Nature's journeymen had made mates, and not
made them well. There is a profusion of flowing and curliany hair schich seems rather to solicit
the ungueuts of the perfinner, than to have endured the bornid heal of the desert, or the rough
storms of the forest. The shag et a Lion'sauth is n very différent sort of thing.
However such dressed Lions nay lie thonght to accord with Allegory, they are demonstrably
a variance with Nature. To be sure, what might berome a Lion in the procession of the Cardinal

Whathe not the public "looked up to them for light" on that subject, (to use the language of
STERNE,) they thought the Public deserved it:" and they therefore, as the best practical means
of eliciting that light, first copied the general forms/and attitudos of most of the wild animals that
