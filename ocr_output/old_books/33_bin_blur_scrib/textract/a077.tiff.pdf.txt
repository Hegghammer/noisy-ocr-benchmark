I will again pass wifi the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and relate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
1796 after ruling over Armenia filty.cight years.
He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his dominisms, and
ting
grew to be so mighty in battle that the neighboprips nations called his
country Aramia and the people were called Armians, such names as
Armenia or Amenians being no doubt later corruptions.
The tirst victory of Aram was over Neuchar king of Media, whom he
took prisoker and put to death, and made a large part of the country of the
defeated prince tributary in his own. The second victory of Aram was over
Barsham king of Babylon, whom also be took prisoner and put to death.
The next victory was over the king of Cappadocia the army of the
Cappadocians was pursued to the very shores of the Mediterranean, and the
fell into the hands of Aram B.C. 1796. Also Ninus
king of Assyria, at one time an cager enemy, awed by the victories of AramT,

or asseit, but in taking up link by link of whatever knowledge has been left
to us, there scems to be grounds for supposing that the Aramicans'

designated by foreign writers as "a people of Semitic race/langylage and
the western Loundaries of Babylonia and the highwick of Western Via
were no other than the I fai who under their King \ram had spread their
conquests and their kingdom into Mesopotamia and even to the shores of
the Mediterranean.
Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when he includes
Northern Mesopotamia, together withlic nommamous country of Amar,
