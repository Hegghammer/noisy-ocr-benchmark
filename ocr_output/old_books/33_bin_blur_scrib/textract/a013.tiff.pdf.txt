WHY AND WHEREFORI
"irrinating
la making Estudy of my race, I have found three marked characteristics
Intelligence Combined with these three characteristics
is an intense AVE of Nationality. We live in a complex world. In an
independent people these characteristics and this sentiment are laudable
Virtues. In a subject people they are Crimes.
After I had laid this bitter Truth to heart, I did not have to seek for the
Wiry
the Armenian Massacres.
The Armenian Massacres stand withont their parallel in history. (iff
human mind staggers to contemplate the frendish orgies of which they lage
been the victims, and no pen can diescribe their horrors : and this helpless
christian people are to-day in the same deadly peril as they have been since
the famous Treaty of Berm consigned then Dound hand and foot to the
mercy of their executioners.
The Armenians may be led again "as sheep to the slaughter' and the
work of extermination be completed-Jesus Christ was crucified on
Calvary and the servant is not greater than his Lord-but the work of their
extermination can only be completed when the evil intluences in the Jurkish
Empire have reached their culminating point. Hitherto the of
Europe have by their jealousies and rivalries cultivated these evil infléençes,
they have wateral them and made them grow, but wheh their culminating
point is reached, they must reaat on Christentom and the natural
consequence must follow. Those who sow the wind, must reap the whirl-
wind. It is in the natural order of
I will allow that Literty, Justice, Equality, Fraternity are the watchwords
of Young Turket but Young Turkey is only a small minority ; the great
majority of the Turkish nation are not Young Turks.
The question therefore resolves tselt into this critical point : What will
Christendom do even now?
