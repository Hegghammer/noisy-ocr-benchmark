Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Emision
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this super-added the
mg
large neigbouring bodics of Kurds and Circassians, uxcater wanders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation b those lives comprise
murder and robbery, and who have through weary denturies unremittingly
quartered thunsalves upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits of their labour and toil. Indeed as the Hamidich cavaly which
was establiShed expressly for the Hamidian massactes was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized murder, can now find for those habits in
which they were encouraged and trained to indulge by the Hamidian
régime.

inder all such conditions no hope of better days can be forthcoming
Armenian race whom force of circumistances keeps on the soil of the
no prospect of better times seems possible, for that unhappy portion of the
fatherland.
The appointment of Christian governors over the provinces in-
habited by them might analionsterucacneeilrachrr alternative,
of allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespective of creed or
nationality, would furnish some means of self-dence against the raids
and barbarities of the oppressors but even if such concessions were granted,
life for the christian peasure subject to Turkish rule, and living in the midst
of his ene nies, must remain one long struggle and battle against pillage,
murder, depredation, and ottences of the worst nature. Notthe most fertile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the nos assiduous
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincis, can to the
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,
BI
happiness, and security of life and property, whion/tl law of all civilized
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer an a ther of the soil.
