PROLOGUE
THE HORSES OF KING MANUS
As for the youth who had tried to steal he white
horse that the King owned, he was bound hand
and foot and taken into the ca tle of the King.
There he was thrown down beside the trestles of
the great table, and the hot wa. from the candles
that lighted the suppe. board a dri ped down upon
him. And it was told to h m that at the morrow's
sunrise he would be slain with the sword.
Then the King lled upon one to finish the
story tha t was being told when the neigh of
the vhite horse W as heard in the stable. The
story could not be finished for him, however,
because the one who had been telling it was now
outside, guarding the iron door of the stable with
a sword in his hand. And King Manus, sitting
at the supper board, could not eat nor refresh
himself because there was no one at hand to finish
the story for him.
