THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
But first the Enchanter showed me that great
wonder that was near the gardens - the Tower
of Babylon. It was a red tower mountin very
high into the air. Outside of it there were steps
that went round it and to the very top of
it - a thousand steps. And on the top of
the tower, resting against the Spear OI Nimrod,
was the Magic Mirror of Ba vlon. Zabulun the
Enchanter made me look to the top, and I was
made fearful by looking so high.
Oh, that I might tell you, King Manus, of the
wonders of the Tower of Babylon ! In the shadow
of it there slep t tw o mighty ones - the two Genii
who guarded Bak ylon, Harut and Marut they were
named. Gian beings they were. As they slept
there the beard of each was spread across his
mighty chest, and it was a beard so broad that
no horse of the mighty horses that the King owned
could leap across it. Very great but very old
were Harut and Marut, the Genii who guarded
Babylon.
I was made fearful by looking to the top of the
tower. And then I was made still more fearful
