Preface.—Introduction. IS
THE OLD BIBLE.

Perhaps the most interesting relic left by our good old ancestor,
Barnabas, is the oLD Bir.e, which he brought with him from England.
It is now in the possession of the Hon. Silas Horton, of Southold.
It was taken to the Bible House, New York, some years ago, and care-
fully repaired, and every torn leaf mended, so that it is now entire,
and in a good condition.

We find in it the following record:

«Tmprinted at London, by the Deputies of Christian Barker.”
Printer to the Queen's Most Excellent Majestie, 1597-
Cum PRIVILEGIO.

Then follows in manuscript: |

“ Barnabas Horton, to his son Jonathan Horton, this BimLe he did bequeath, in

Then follows:

. Capt. Jonathan Horton, his Book. God give him grace, Jonathan Horton, 1683.”

In another place, and probably in the handwriting of Jonathan
Horton, Jr., we find:

* The Word of the Lord God of Jonathan Loxton, 1748-49.”

Again we find: . .

“Lydia Tuthil|, her Boo’, given her by her mother, as it is said.”

And then follows:

« Feb, 8, in the year 1742, then Jonathan Tuthill departed this life—the son of
Henry Tuthill and Wethia (Horton) Tuthill. Susanna Tuthill, wife of Jonathan
Tuthill, departed this liie May 16, in the year 1743, in the 50th year of her age.
Henry Tuthill, departed this life the 4th day of January, in the year 1750, aged 84.
Bethia Tuthill, wife of Henry Tuthill, departed this life March 16th, 1744, in the
73d year of her age.”

OLD MUSKET, CASK, AND WALKING STAFF.

- The old wood hooks are still attached to the big beam of the old
house, upon which Barnabas used to hang his oLD MUSKET, which was
called ‘‘uncle Barney’s guart pot.’’ He brought it with him from
England. It is now in the possession of Barnabas B. Horton, of
