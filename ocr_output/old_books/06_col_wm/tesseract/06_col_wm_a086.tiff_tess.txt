meaning ; sometimes modes of expression are so difficult to translate from
one language into another, and it can be said that the term “Illuminator ” is
used for want of a better word in English. Yhe Armenians call their
religion “loois havat” the word “loois” means “light” and ‘“havat”
means “faith” or “religion,” but if I translated the two words as
“enlightened faith” or “enlightened religion” the translation would not
suitably convey the meaning of the original.

THE CATHEDRAL OF ETCHMIATZIN,
(Only Begotten Descended). _
Seat of ihe Supreme Patriarch, The foundation stone was laid by St. Gregory the

Illuminator who built the Church in the third century of the Christian era.

The cathedral of Etchmiatzin is identified with Gregory; its name
“Etchmiatzin’? means in the Armenian language “the only begotten is
descended,” and the story attached to it is, that ina vision Christ appeared
to Gregory descended in light; Gregory built his church on the spot where

the vision had appeared to him, giving it the name of “Etchmiatzin ” (only
begotten descended). The cathedral also gives its name to the town
Etchmiatzin, the ecclesiastical metropolis of Armenia.
