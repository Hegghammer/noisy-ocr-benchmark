Since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national religion
of the Armenians, and they have clung to their christian faith through un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure.

The cathedral of Etchmiatzin built by Gregory still stands to-day ; it
constantly been repaired and rebuilt in some part or other, until perhaps
little of the original building may be left, but it still claims to be the church
built by the patron saint of Armenia. I shall here quote a passage from
“ Historical Sketch of the Armenian Church,” written by an Armenian
priest :

“Owing to political circumstances the Armenian Patriarchate had at
times to be transferred to metropolises and to other principal towns of
Armenia. In the year A.D. 452 it was removed to Dwin, in 993 to Ani,
in 1114 to R6émklah, and in 1294 to Sis. Lhe Kingdom of Cilicia becoming
extinct, and, we having no more a kingdom and no longer a capital town, it
was natural and proper to re-transfer the See to its own original place, as
the entire nation unanimously desired it. Accordingly, in the year 1441, it

» was decided by an ecclesiastical meeting that the seat of the Catholicus should
return to Holy Etchmiatzin, where to this day has been preserved the
proper unbroken succession from our Apostles and from cur holy Father,
St. Gregory the Illuminator.

I read the other day in one of the foreign papers published in Japan,
the following piece of news ;

* An Armenian Charch pronounced by experts to date from the second
century of the Christian cra, has been discovered in a fair state of preserva-
tion in the neighbourhood of Bash-Aparnah.”

Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light on Armenian history.
