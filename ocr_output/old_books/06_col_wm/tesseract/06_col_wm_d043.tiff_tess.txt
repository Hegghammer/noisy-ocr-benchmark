CHAPTER UI '
HATE AND LOVE ,

LINE certainly did not belong to ary ordinary
A type and she would have puzzled the psychol-

ogist to classify. She was so meny sided as to
be in.a class by herself. She had pienty of common
sense and intelligence for her years and an outlook
essentially fair minded and just. Bui she also had a
quiet hauteur, curiously coupled with humility, and at
the same time a winning manrer that was irresistible;
so that the strange thing was that she had only to ask
and most people voluntarily st>mitted to her desires.
This unusual power might have been very dangerous
to her characier aud spoued her, had it not been that
what she wanted wes almost always just and reason-
able and moreover sic never used her power for her
own benefit. Further, her humble estimate of her own
capacity for judgment caused her but rarely to exercise
the power at all. In practice it was almost confined
to those cases where a sweet minded child’s natural in-
stinct for fair play sees further than the sophistries of
the adult. ‘

She was practically unaware of this power, which
was destined to bring her into conflict with Eleanor
Mowbray ; nor did she take the least delight, as she might
easily have done, in exercising power for power’s sake.
