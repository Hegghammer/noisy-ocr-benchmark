viii PREFACE
from Smith, who himself was prone to include
* the most extravagant myths in his pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE JIIstoRY OF
THE Lives AND Acrions oF THE Most Famous
HiguwayMen. Both of them include pirates and
murderers. Of the “truth” of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better. ,

No one has ever reprinted those caiuthors in
their original extravagance, or their grossiness.
Tt would be impossible ; and, if possible, it would
not be entertaining. Nor has any one ever edited
them, or even written an independent history of
the highwaymen. When we consider how astonish-
ingly popular those romances have ever been
which have had Claude Du Vall, and Turpin,
and their like for heroes, this is not a little
surprising.

Perhaps the lask has been abandoned because
of the diffieulty—ithe almost insuperable difficulty
—of sifting fact from fiction, and because of a
chilling sense that it would be a thankless task
to presént the highwayman as he really was: a
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
cruel, and often cowardly. No novelist would
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dis-
service ; and I do not think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific spirit of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
