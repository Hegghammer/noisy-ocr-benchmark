be no time to reclaim them from the purse:

I made my way back along the pas:ace,
walking in the angle formed by the flooi
and the side walls of the staterooms ra‘ her
than the floor, and went back wp the for’ard
companion-way, the same that J came down.
Going along the passave (on deck B) I
looked down some of the cross passages that
lead to the staterooms, and at the bottom of
the ones * passed I saw that the portholes
were open anc that the water could not have
been wore than a iew feet from them. Here
let me staie ‘at I consider it most extraor-
dinary that the portholes on the lower decks
should not have been closed and sealed as we
steamed through the war zone. At luncheon
the portholes in the dining-saloon on deck
D were open, and so I doubt not that
all the others on that deck were open.
