When this book was written, the writer was }
under the supposition then generally current thac .
the Armenian Massacres of April, 1909, in Cilicia tae
were instigated by Abd-ul Hamid and his Yildiz , by
Clique. Babikian Effendi, the Armenian deputy .
who went to Adana from Constantinople to in- ‘ /
vestigate into the massacres, plainly reported that a
all investigations had failed to trace them to Abd-ul
Hamid and his Yildiz Clique. Babikian Effendi, ‘|
as was to be expected, died suddenly on his return
to Constantinople, but later on it became known | ,
that the massacres of April, 1909, hadbeen planned, a
prepared, organized and carried into execution by '
L the Constitutional Government of what has been ”
called ‘Liberal Turks” or ‘‘ Young Turks.” :
