‘Church, but was also a fearless patriot—a distinguished linguist, an eloquent preacher, and a
thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between ‘Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the feared fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the annals of Armenian history,

At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinople, sont
by Monseigneur Nereés, the Patriarch, their object heing to request the signatory lowers ot
the Berlin Treaty to foree a guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.

Abdul Hamid and his advisers were furious at this affront, and Monseigneur Nercés was
summoned to the Palace. It is said that when he received the summons he simply smiled
and asked one of of his curates to read the Burial Service to him, as le did not expect to
return alive. However, he went. No one has ever heard what passed between the Sultan
and himself at the interview ; suffice it to say that he immediately summoned the Armenian
General Assembly and tendered his resignation. This was not aeeeptod by the Assembly,
and, amidst enthusiastie cheers, he was carried haek to his apartments at the Patriarchate.
Meanwhile x peremptory order reached him, signed hy the Sultan, to reeall the Armenian
delegation from Berlin. ‘This Monseigneur Varjabétian point-blank refased to do, and retired
to his private residence at Haskeuy, a village on the Golden [forn. ‘The suceess of the dele-
gation, however, did not came up to his expeetations. The Arienians, as it happened, could
not be heard, but they were so far successful as to have on artiele inserted in the treaty.

The Sultan and his advisers never forgave the Patwiareh this, though they could not
openly do anything to him on account of his enormous popularity. ‘Time passed on, and to
all appearance the incident was forgotten, but it was not so. One summer afternoon a most
eordial invitation was sent by a very high dignitary of the Palaee, requesting the Arehhishop
to dine with him informally. An invitation ef this kind could not very well be refused, so ac
the Archbishop, aceompamicd only by a body-servant named Vartan, repaired to the Pasha’s "
house. The Pasha received hii at the door aud eseorted the visitor with much ceremony and
extreme eourtesy to a private apartment of the salamlik of his house (the men’s quarters),
where dimer was served. The geniality displayed by his host dispelled any fears that the
Archbishop might have had as to his personal safety.

After dinner, as usual, ecolive was served. Now, this serving of the eoflee is rather a
ceremonial according to high Turkish etiquette, and it is not unusal for guests to bring their
own fchooboukdar (the servant who carries his master’s pipe and pouch and also superintends
the waking of his coffee). The Archbishop was presented with a “ tehoobouk ” (pipe) filled
and lighted for smoking, and a servant followed with coffee. The Archbishop accepted both
with due compliments to his host, and took a sip at his coffee. Just at that moment the
heavy curtains over the doorway were thrown apart, revealing the ghastly pale face of his
servant Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, ina yoice trembling with emotion, “ Monseigneur,
E did not brew the coffee!”

This was enough for the Archbishop ; he pretended to he startled and spilt the coffee, but,
alas! he had already drunk a small quantity of it. Meanwhile a seuille was gomg on behind
the portitve, where his poor seryant Vartan was paying the penalty of his devotion to his
master. Concerning Vartan’s whereabouts or his ultimate end nothing was ever made public
—the poor fellow simply vanished. Monseigneur Varjabétian, after a short interval thanked
the Pusha for his generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily summoned. The Patriarch took to his hed,
and lost all his hair through the effects of the poison. Then, one morning, when a servant
