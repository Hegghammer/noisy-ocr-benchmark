Remember that they know not what they do
Who strike in deadly fear and ghastly hate;
Remember that somehow, and at some time,
Each crime exacts its human penalty.
Remember that man’s conscience and man’s mind
Are agents of Thy purpose and Thy pia:
Which work within a deadlier revenge
Than any shrapnel shot or sare thrust.
Remember that new generations come
Upon whom fall the burden anc the curse,
The anguish of old hatreds and past wrongs,
The crushing ‘ebi, the struggle and despair.
Restrain, O God, the sweep of this vast hate;
Recall the nations to their sense of shame:
To those in blinding war, to us at peace,
Reveal anew the message of the Christ.
