their own. For six hundred years their ancient eapital city of Ani has stood a splendid hut
empty ruin in the desert between Kars and the great mountain of Alagéz, which confronts
Ararat, with nearly equal height. They haye been rent asunder and tormenied by Persians,
Turks, Tartars, and Russians in turn. Even their religion is not nationalistic or dis inetly
separate from other forms of religion, like the Jewish. Except for metaphysical shades of
difference, hardly comprehensible to the modern world, there is little to distinguish it from the
orthodox Christianity of the Near East. Yet, through innumerable disasters and aticmpts
at extermination, the race persists, like the Jews, with astonishing vitality, unmistakab.c in
characteristies which may not he exactly heroic, but lead to a certain material success. After
all, it is only in harassed and persecuted nationalities that true patriotism ever survives.
