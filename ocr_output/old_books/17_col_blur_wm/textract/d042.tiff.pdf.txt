THE CHILD OF THE MOAT
They were almost too excited to sleep and Aline, as
her eustom was, when she lay awake, amused herself
by building castles in the air. Sometimes she would
imagine herself as a great lady, sought after by all the
noble knights of the land, but holding herself aloof with
reserved dignity until one, by some deed of enurual
distinction, should win her favour. As a rule.
this seemed rather a dull part to play, thoug th re was
something naturally queenly in her and she
would therefore prefer something more She
would take the old Seots romance of Bard Holen, or
Burd Aline, as her own inspir Lion, and follow her
knight in the disguise of a page over mountain and
torrent and through every bardship. T11 better suited
the romantie self-sacrifice of ber usual moods and, by
its imaginary deeds of ben en, nistered just as much
to her sense of exaltation To-night had opened vistas
of new suggration; ad al e pl tured her knight and her-
self fleeing belore a host of enemies and miraculously
disappesring et the critieal moment into the secret room.
But at last the fell into a sound slumber and did not
wake till it was searly time for the morning meal.
