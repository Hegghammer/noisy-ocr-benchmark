We give BARNABAS HORTOS as the Proface and Introduction to this
little volume of Chronicles He was probably the son of Josey
Horton, of Leicestershire, England, and born in the little hamlet of
Mousely of that shire. Of his history before he came to America rery
little is known. He came over in the ship in 633-38
He landed at Hampton, Mass, How long he remained at Hamptor
is not known. But in 1640 we find him with his wife and chil-

William Welles, Esq., Peter Hallock, John Tuthill, Richard Terry,
Thomas Mapes, Matthias Corwin, Robert Ackerly, Jacob Concy, John
Conklin, Isanc Arnold, and John and on the 2154 day of
Oct., 1640, assisted by the venerable Rev. Johi Davenport and Gov.
Eaton, they organized themselvé into 4 Congregational Church, and
sailed to the east end of Long nos Southold They had all
been members of Puritan churches in England, and all had families
with them except Peter Hallock They Moubtless had been on the
island previous to this tim and looked out their homes. On nearing
the shore they cast los to decide who should first set foot on the land.
The lot fell on Peter Hallock and the place where he stepped upon
the land has ever since 4ch known as Hallock's Landing.
On coming ahore, they II knelt down and engaged in prayer,
Peter Hallock learling, as had been determined by the lot. These
were the first perions of any civilized nation that had ever attempted
to settle on the ear end of Long Island. Ser Griglin's fournal.
Barnabas Horton was a man of deep-toned póety, and a warm advo-
cate of civil and religions froedom He was one of the most promi-
nent and influential men of Southold He was for many years a
magistrate, and several times a member of the General Court at New
Haven and Harford He built the first framed dwelling-house ever
erected on the cast of Long Island, and that house is still (1875)
standing and occupied. It is a shingle-honse, that is, shingles are
used for weather-boards, and the sides have never been reshingled,
and the roof but once, according to the statement of Jonathan Gold-
smith Horton, the last Horton occupant of the old house.
