THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLING.

Fairies, and attendant ladies are described Of two of the laiter it
is said-
"Their kirtles were of rede cendel,"
1 laced smalle, jollyf, and well,
There might none gayer go."
In the French version of the same poem it is, we read, more fuliy
expressed It says, "They were richly habited and very rightly laced."
The Lady Triamore is thus described: -

admiration, thus throws down the gaundet of challenge, and exclaims

The word menth or maint being used instead of very or much. Some
differences of opinion have existed among writers as to the origin of the
word corset. Some are of opinion that the French words corps, the
body, and (to liglitly inclose or incase), led to the adoption of
the term. Madame La Sunte gives it as her opinion, however, that it is
more robably , corruption of the single word corpu, which was formerly
writter 2nd may be taken as a diminutive form of it. Another
vlow or the masser has been that the name of a rich material called
which was at one time extensively used in the manufacture of
corsets, say have been thus corrupted. This is scarcely probable, as
the word corset was in use at too early a period to admit of that origin.
Perhaps as early an instance of the use of the term corset as any in
existence may be found as a portion of an entry in the household register
of Eleanor, Countess of Leicester, which bears the date May 24, 1265:
