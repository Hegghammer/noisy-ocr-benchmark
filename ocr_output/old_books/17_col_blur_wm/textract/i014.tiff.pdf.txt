THE ZONE
Avert Thy gaze, o God, close tight Thine eyes!
Glance down no longer on the ocean foam,
Lest Thou behold such horrors as can turn
Men's burning hearts to ice, and chill the sou.
Keep Thine heart warm and full of e vity
That Thou mayst yet be able
And pity feel for those who 1 low not when
To pause in deeds of ruthl ess vifie
Restrain The and ke Thine hand in
check;
Smite P. nor Gercely the at without the pale
Those who can dar to strew the ocean waste
With fello creatures, innocent of wrong.
Forget the atudied purpose to destroy;
The launching of the missile through the deep;
Theshattered hull; the crushed and bleeding forms;
The seething swirl of wreckage, women, men.
