MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE
It will be seen by the engraving that the old house is double. The
western part is that which was built by Barnabas in 1659 60. The
east or two-story part was built by Jonathan 1., about 1682 The upper
room of this part was used for a court-house for nearly twenty years,
as we learn from Thompson's History of Long Island, and some of
the old benches used when it was a court-hous are still preserved.
The old "castle," as Jonathan G. Horton, its last Horton occupant,
used to call it, is in all probability the oldest wood house in America.
I know of no dwelling-house of any kind, stone or brick, now stand-
ing, that can date back as far this veneral ie old mansion. There
were a few huts on the east of Long Island previons to 1640-two or
three it is said on Shelter Island. Bet well as those built by
the Puritans, immediately on their seitlement in Southold, soon all
passed away. Not a vertige of any of the first generation buildings
can be found except this one. it remained for the house that Barnabas
built to survive the of ages and to stand to-day as a noble
representative of the dwielling of two hundred and fifteen years ago.
But the old stands to -day not only as peering above all others
by is but also by its occupancy. It is not very often that we find
two genera of the same name, living and dying in the same house-
rarely
find three Dut here we have six generations in succession, all
bearing the Horton name, living and dying in the same house, and
all born in it except Barnabas I., and his son Jonathan. We may go
to the castles and palaces of the old world, and search long and dili-
gently, and fail to find a parallel case.
With a few repairs, the old castle may yet stand for generations far
in the future.
It requires some thought and reflection to realize the lapse of time
since the old house was built. See the old Puritan himself there
twenty years; then his son Jonathan, twenty-eight years; and then
Jonathan, Jr., about sixty years; and next Lawrence and his son Jona-
