CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS
DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES
THAT there has hitherto existed no grood book of Engravings of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the progress of the student in that department of Art, is to be regretted. The talents
of Mr. SCOTT, brought into action by those of GILPIN, Cooren and the REINAGLES,
have presented the public with excellent representations of the distinguished ornaments of the
turf: the sports of the field, and the habits and mauners of the canine rece were also duly
honoured: but of the ferocious TIGER tribe, and the lordly LION, we have nothing extant that
would bear critical inspection, beyond a few detached prints -nothing like a collection of
figures, whose justness and accurney of form, action, charneter, and expression, might be
relied on.
Does any reader imagine that the various Etchings which have been performed-chiefly
abroad-by Artists of no menn ability, may be considered as exceptions? They are not exceptions
or at best, the number which might be so regariled is and those, for the most part, of
dimensions not accommodated to the draw ér of the cabinet, or the shelf of the library.
But they are not objectiouable on this ground alone. Speaking of them in the aggregate, the
heavier charge lies against them of being insufficient to those purposes of taste and information
which are the ends of Art. Exen those after TITIAN and after RUBENS (the latter of whom has
perhaps painted a greater number than any other of the old masters) are far more deficient in
form, character, and expression, than is generally supposed, or than will be ensily believed, by
those who have not netually compared them with the Lions, Leopards, and Tigers of Nature.
They have been taker too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
-Nor is this intended to impugn the merits, ns historical or poetical painters, of those distinguished
Artists, but sumply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that ns a painter of allegory, RUBENS
might consider that stroug infusion of haman form, character, and expression, by which his Lions,
for example, are distinguished, as necessary, or conducive, to his allegorical purposes; or, it is pos-
sible that his knowledge of this animal may not have been thoroughly well-grounded, and that he
may hav laboured under early prejudice of mind, or of vision, in this part of his education as a
Painter, and may not have seen Lions as they really are. This is what the writer is most inclined
to believe, (though not to insist) ; for even in treating the subject of Daniel in the den of Lions-
