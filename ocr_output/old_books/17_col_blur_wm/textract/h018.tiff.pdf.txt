It is said that Barnalus Horton I. was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities
His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone
was re-lettered about filty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It is elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. The original base was of brick, but it had all crumbled down
many years ago. The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Horton.
The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and leads -
follows:
Nieth burled the body of Ma. BURNARES HORTON who was borm a
Momsely, Leicestershire, Old England, and died at South 14.00 the 13 day of
July, 1680, aged So years."
In the centre of the stone we find the 1 pitaph, de follows:
- Here lies my bodly in Jult
"TIII Christ shall conto to the it with the just:
My soul ascended the of C4,
Where willh smpet abode
Then hay wille,
To be ar this life:
And all follow the Lord,
Hel and olles His shered word:
in your call upon name,
For 41 have you to the sume:
Them God will bless you with your childrem all,
And to then place He will you call."

It is san) that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it. to
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the original
thirteen who brought his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and memory
should not perish from the earth.
