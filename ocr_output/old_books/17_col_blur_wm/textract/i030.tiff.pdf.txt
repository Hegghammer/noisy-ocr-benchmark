the ones 1 pass II aw that the portholes
were open und that the water could not have
been goo than a iew feet from them. Here
let me state that I consider it most extraor-
dinary that the portholes on the lower decks
should not have been closed and sealed as we
steamed through the war zone. At luncheon
the portholes in the dining-saloon on deck
D were open, and so I doubt not that
all the others on that deck were open.
