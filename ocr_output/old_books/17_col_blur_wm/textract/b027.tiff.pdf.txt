CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
5
No. VI.
IN this GROUP by MR. EDWIN LANDSEER there is much of violent animal Expression, and
Character fades before it, or rather, is absorbed in it. It tells a story of the past as well as the
present, and is pregnant with a catastrophe not difficult to anticipate from the actions and
expressions of the parties engaged. A FAWN has been seized by a LEOPARD, who has been
despoiled of his prey by a more powerful TIGER. The Tiger in his turn becomes the victim of an
enraged LION.
The expression of the wounded Leopard is that of painful suffering mingle with dread.
Together, they amount to agony. He shrieks while he submits. The Tiger is still enraged and
resisting, though astounded with the power and suddenness of the Lion's attack. Heis-losing his
etergy of resistance, and is beginning to feel that all resistance is vain. He roars with anguish;
while his expression is that of terror, and indignation not yet subdued
The Lion, who has just made his thundering spring, appears conscious of having Litally seized
his adversary, and luxuriates fearlessly in his victory; and with a powerful and just expression of
earnivorous enjoyment.-Meanwhile the characters of the animal severally, are faithfully and
specifically represented.
Although our main purpose be to exhibit rather a pictorial than a physiological view of the
subject: having descanted on the word Character we shall probubly be expected to add, at least
a word or two, on the leading characteristic of the carnivor class of quadrupeds.
The generie characters of the Felin or Cat. kind, are easily enumerated in the concise
language of the naturalists. Their heads are round; their visages short : they have six cutting
teeth, and two eanine, in either jaw their tongues are aculeated, the prickles inclining backward
their claws sharp, hooked, and retractile ; their ears small and acuminated; they have five toes on
each of the fore-feet, and four only on those behind.
Of this genera of Cats, we here exhibit the four principal species, Lions, Tigers, Leopards,
and Pauthers, of which the Lion is justly placed at the hend-at lenst, the unanimous voice of ages
has pronounce hira to be the king of beasts, and we have enthroned him accordingly in our Title-
page, (No. I.) They form a tribe that is especially and properly Carnirorous, being the only
class of quadrupeds that are exclusively flesh-caters. Their jaws are very completely armed for
this purpose their canine teeth being very long and angular, with the edges of the angles turned
toward the inside of their mouths; 80 that when the animal has caused them to meet, or eross each
other in the flesh of its prey, these formidable teeth will cut or tear a way through, by drawing
them back without opening his mouth.
Their claws, and the formation of their feet, too, are eminently conducive to their predacious
