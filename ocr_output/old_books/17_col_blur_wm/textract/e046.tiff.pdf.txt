THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE
mother of Brutus, was presented with a pair by Julius Casur, the value
of which was L48,4572
Bracelets are also ornaments of high antiquity, as are ring and
brooches of various forms for fastening the dress.
Rich gold chains and jewelled fastenings were in common ure during
this period. The annexed illustration represents a Roman lady of
rank about the reign of Heliogabalus. Little alteration appeara to have
taken place in the general style of costumi for som very considerable
period of time, and the patrician ladies concealed beneath their flowing
draperies a kind of corset, which they tigistened ver) considerably, for a
slight and tapering waist was looked upon as great beauty in women,
and great attention was paid to the formation of the figure, in spite of
all that has been written about the purely natural and statuesque forms
of the Roman matrons. On the conquest of the Roman Empire by the
wild and savage Hunnis) trib frshiou, art, taste, literature, and civilisa-
tion were swep mithless away and a long, weird night of mental
darkness may be said to have reigned throughout the land from the
tenth to the middle of the Giteenth century, and we see little or nothing
of Koman leganci or magnificence of dress to distinguish it above other
nation froca that period.
