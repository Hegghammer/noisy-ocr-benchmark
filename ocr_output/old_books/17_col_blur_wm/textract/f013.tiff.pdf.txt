PREFACE

Most of NS like to keep a few of the illusious
ice belieted in then schoolbogs. Scientifie his-
torious have degraded many of our nucient heroes
and exalted the cillains, for tchow of old NO
mad ICUS too thick and slab. Beliefs are being
nasmiled on ecery side. To abolish the tradificial
courtesy of Clande Du Vall or the considerate
conduct of Captain Hind toold, thergfor
be
strokes of the makindest, and I huce here ittempled
no such iconocloam Even there / cassiof be-
liete, I hace fold the if has been
morth the telling-(18 il is found in criminal
trials, or in Smith or and other old
sources, decoroualy strippe / of mach cile laugunge.
For really, thère wich that seems incredible
mey be fully proved, and wehere the believable
tarus out aof ritirely to be fulse, 'tia your only toay.
To contrase the story of the hightaymen from
Smitk and Johnson doweu to the approneling end
of all such things in the beginning of the nine-
leend century, is like taking up and couelnding
a half-told tale. But it corth the doing.
Only in respeel of the great figure Turpin has
alwoys masle, has il beeu found really necessary
to seriously consider and re-state the eareer of
that unch-overrated sconndrel, and to put him
in his proper place : " cery much lower one
than he usnally occupies.
