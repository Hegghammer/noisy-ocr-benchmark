THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE
29
Oriental figure of speech, is said to have been *ravished by the beauty
of her sandals.' Like the belles of Egypt she did not disdain, in retting
off her charms, to have recourse to perfumes and cosmetics, and
previously to setting out she 'anointed herself with precious ON atment.'
In another place Jezebel is said to 'paint her eyelids;' and Solomen,
in
the Proverbs, in describing the deceitful woman, adjures his see not 10
be taken with her cyclids,' evidently alluding to the use of colly.ium.
The Jewish beauty owed no slight obligation to her luxuriant tresses,
which were decorated with waving plumes and string. of pearls; and
in allusion to this custom, followed among the tribes from time imme-
morial, St. Paul affirms that 'a woman's ernament is her hair.' Judith
braided the hair of her head and pot a tire upon it;' and the headdress
of Pharaoh's daughter, in the Canticles, is cocapared by Solomon to
Carmel, No mention is made of Judith's mérror, but it was undoubtedly
made of brass, like those described in Exodus xxxviii. 8 as "the
looking-glasses of the vomen which assembled at the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation.**
