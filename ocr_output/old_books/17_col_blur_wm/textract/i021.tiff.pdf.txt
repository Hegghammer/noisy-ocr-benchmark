THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
paredness towards emergency. I was keenly
interested in all that was done aboard ship as
we approached the Irish Coast, and in fact all
through the voyage I kept my eyes unusual!
wide open.
At night the shades in the salont were
closely drawn, and I noticed that my bed/nom
steward left a note for the night W atehman
stating just which ports were of 0 w! en he
(the steward) went off duty.
Friday noon ben the sun was posted I
was surprised, for I certainly thought that
this was the the to put on speed. The sea
was smooth as pancake, an ideal chance for
a dash up the const. When I heard the fog
horn early Friday morning I turned over and
took another snooze, for there was no use in
getting up if it was foggy and disagreeable
weather. The fog did not last long and was
nothing more than a morning mist.
I got up at noon and had time for a stroll
