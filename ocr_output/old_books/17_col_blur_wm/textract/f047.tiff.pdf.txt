ROBIN HOOD
19
more plensant to consider the romantie spirit that
evolved him and gave him his exquisite setting
of mossy glades and giant oaks, where the sun
comes in golden-green shafts through the em-
bowering foliage, and you hear the winding of
the hunters' horns in chase of the deer. There
is a springtime gladness in the old verses, of
which this is typical
Whan shaws bene shoene and shroddes full fayre
And leaves both large and longe,
Itt's merry walking in the fayre forrini
To hear the small birdes songe.
To se the dere draw to the dale,
And leve the hilles hee,
And shadow hem in the grea
Under the grene-wode Lre.
It is the springtime of the year and of the
English nation that you glimpse in these lines :
a pieture of that larger ruma England of possible
adventure, and unconitaminated skies that is now
a thing of the past.
Nature is portrayed in these ballads with a
vividnes and certainty that more ambitious poets
cannot ni tch:
The woodweele sang and wold not cense,
Sitting upon the apraye,
Soe lowde, he wakened Robin Hood,
In the greenwood where he lay.
It is versification of the simplest and the most
sincere kind.
Robin Hood, real or imaginary character, has
himself no criminal taint, but he is one of the
VOL. 1.
