DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE
I have thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested witnesses.
- Weare having a perfeetly hideons time here. Thousands have been noo
in this province they ray : but the number is probalily greater, for every Christion village
wiped ont In Adana about 5000 have perishod After Turks and Armeniase hail
made pettor, the Turks came in the night with hose and kerovene. and set fire to viliat
ofthe Armenian quarter. Next day the French and Armenian schools were fired, Nenrly
one in the Armenian school perished, anyloody trying to cicape being shot down by thesoldies
-
The Turkish Authorities do mothing except arrest unoffending Armenians, from whon
by torture they extort the moit fanciful confersions. Even the are not ma from
their injustice. A man was being earried in to the yesterday when be war and taken
off to gaol. 1 dare not think what his fate may be.
For fiends incaruate commend me to the Turks Nobody is sal from loom. They
murder babies in front of their mothers : they half morder and violate the wives while
the husbands are lying there dying in pools of blood."
-
The authorities did mothing, and the soldiers were than the cround, for they were
better One homs in our quarter was burned witi. 115 peopli inside. We counted
the bodics. The soldiers set fire to the door, and/as the . lows had iron bars, mobody
could get out. Everybody in the house was alive. They were all women and
children and old from letter of Mrs. n ylic, wife of British Consul
at Adana : published in the London - Daily
IN THIS HOUSE 115 WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ROASTED ALIVE
History repents itwelf. In 1895 Turkish soldiera fell upon seventy to eighty young
women and girls in a chureh, where they had fled for refuge, and after outraging
them, barricaded them in, setting fire to the building at the time, and derisively abouting
to their victims as they were being roasted alive, to call upon their Christ to rave them now
