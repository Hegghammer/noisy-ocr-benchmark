CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

au opposite theory, in which instinctive agency is rejected, and the appearances are explained from
a consideration of the necessities and voluntary exertions of the animal. With regard to the
observer, it has been asserted, that it is by experience alone that he distinguishes the signs of the
passions; that we learn, while infants, to consider smiles as expressions of kindness, because they
are accompanied by acts of beneficence and by endearmeuts; and frowns as the coutrary, because
we find them followed by blows; that the expression of anger in a brute, is only that which has
been observed to precede his biting ; and that of foudness, his fawning and licking of the hand.
With regard to the creature itself, it is said, what has been called the external signs of passion, are
merely the concomitants of those voluntary movements, which the passions or habits suggest; that
the glare of the Lion's eye, for example, is the consequence of a voluntary exertion to see his prey
more clearly-his grin, or snarl, the natural motion of uneasing his faug before he uses them.
This, however, is not quite true of all animals and of all expression of passion
" Attendiug merely to the evideuce furnished by auatomical investigation all that I shall
venture to affirm is this : that a remarkable difference is to be found etween the anatomy and
range of expression, in mau and in animals : that in the former there seeins to be a systematic
provision for that mode of communication and that natural langung which is to be read in
the
changes of the countenance that there is no emotion in the mind of man which has not its
appropriate signs; and that there are even muscles in the hum face to which 110 other use can be
assigned than to serve as the organs of this language that, on the other hand, there is in the lower
animals no range of expression which is not fairli referable as a mere accessary to the voluntary
or needful actions of the animal; and that this necessary expression does not appear to be in any
degree commensurate to the variety and stent of the animal's passious."
" There appears to me (contintie Mu. BELL) to beno expression in the face of any animal
lower in the scale of being than quadrupe and in them the strongest and most marked
expression is that of rage ; the object of which is opposition, resistance, and defence. But on
examination it will be found (consisteuth: with the position, that this is merely an accessary of
the motions natural to the accom plishment of the object which the animal has in view) that the
streugth of the expression is in exact proportion to the strength of the principal action in the
creature when thas excited.
" The gramnivorous animals, which seek their subsistence, not by preying upon others, nor by
the ferocity, contest, and victory which supply the earnivorous with food, have in their features no
strori expression of rage. Their expression is chiefly confined indeed to the effect produced on the
general system. Thus the iuflamed eye and the breathing nostrils of the Bull, are induced ouly
by the general excitement. His only proper expression of rage, is in the position of the head,
with the borns turned obliquely to the ground, ready to strike: and indeed it may be observed
in general that animals which strike with the horns, shew little indication of fear or rage, except in
