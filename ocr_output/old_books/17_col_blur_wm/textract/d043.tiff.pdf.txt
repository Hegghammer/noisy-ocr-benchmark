CHAPTER III
HATE AND LOVE
A
LINE certainly did not belong to any os dinary
type and she would have puzzled the paye ol-
ogist to elassify. She was so many aided as to
be in a class by herself. She had plents of common
sense and intelligenee for he: yhar nad an outlook
essentially fair minded and But the also had a
quiet hauteur, euriously coupled wich humility, and at
the same time a winnleg anno that was irresistible;
so that the strange thi 1 var that had only to ask
and most people mount. rily aitted to her desires.
This unusual pow or have been very dangerous
to her chan and spoile her, had it not been that
what
she wanted almost always just and reason-
able and moreover she never used her power for her
own benefit. Further, her humble estimate of her own
eapacity for judgment caused her but rarely to exercise
the power at all. In practice it was almost confined
to those cases where a sweet minded child's natural in-
stinet for fair play sees further than the sophistries of
the adult.
She was practically unaware of this power, which
was destined to bring her into conflict with Eleanor
Mowbray: nor did she take the least delight, as she might
easily have done, in exercising power for power's sake.
