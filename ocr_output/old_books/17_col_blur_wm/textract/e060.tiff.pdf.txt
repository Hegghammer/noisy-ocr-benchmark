THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE
often very richly ornamented with furs and costly need! work. As
fashion changed, dresses were made with open fronts, so as to be wom
over the surcoat without altogether concealing it. A portrail of Marie
d' Anjou, Queen of France, shows this arrangement of costunte Thewair
appears very tightly laced, and the body of the surcoat much res mbles the
modern bodice, but is made by stiffening and cut to pertion the part of
a very strong and efficient corset. Until the termina on the fourteenth
century very little change appears to have been nede either in costume or

by the gentlemen, whilst the long trains again stirred the ire of royalty.
We find Albert of Saxony issuing the following laws: No wives
