PREFACE
from Smith, icho himself toas prone to include
the most extraragent myths in his pages, calls
his folio A GENERAL AND TRUE HISTORY OF
THE LIVES AND ACTIONS OF THE MOST FAMOUS
HIGHWAYMEN. Both of thew include pirates and
murderers. Of the "truth" of much in Smith
and Johnson, the less said the better.
No one has ever reprinted those millions in
their original extraeagance, or their
Il toould be impossible; and, if possible, if sould
not be enterlaining. Nor has any ON ever édited
them, or ecen scritteu an inde endent history of
the hightenymen. When ice consid how astoniah-
ingly popular those romelices have eper beeu
thich have hand Clunde Der all, and Turpin,
and their like for heroes, this is not " little
surprising Perhap the mak has been abondoned because
of the difliculty the almost insuperable difficully
of fling filet from fiction, and becmise of "
chilling seuse that it would be " thankless toak
to present the (18 he really tons: a
fellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
ernel, and often cowardly. No noveliat could
be likely to thank the frank historiau for this dis-
service; and I do not think the historian scho came
to the subject in this cold scientific spiril of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely rend.
