CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
the position of the head. In all gramnivorous animals, the skin of the head is closely attached to
the skull, and capable only of very limited motion : the eye is almost uniformly mild, and the lips
unmoved by passion.
" It is in carnivorous animals, with whose habits and manner of life, ferocity is instinetively
connected, as the great means of their subsistence, that rage is distinguished by the most
remarkable strength of expression. The eye-ball is terrible, and the retraction of the flesh of the
lips indicates the most savage fury. But the first, is merely the exerted attention of the animal
and the other a preparatory exposure of the canine teeth. The great animals of prey-the Lion
and the Tiger-are quite incapable of any other expression of featuré, than this particular display
of ferociousness. When they fawn upon their keeper, there is no motion in their features that
indicates affection."
In this assertion, that the countenances of the of prey incapable of any
other than ferocious expression, we do not quite coincille with our learned physiologist. When
they fawn upon their keeper, we think that indications of affection are exhibited; and find
ourselves ready to ask what else than kindly expression is that " licking of the hand" which our
author has before mentioned. If, however, we should arrant that they may not be capable of
affectionate expression toward their keeper, we ean searce doubt that-toward their young-if
we could observe them in their wild state, as in their moments of playful intercourse and
enjoyment among each other-thes are: at least, wè think there are motions in their fentures that
indiente affection, as well as fear, enquiry, surprise, gratitude, pleasurable wantonness, and some
other sentiments, or emotions. This is our conviction : at the same time, we perceive that the
range of their ferocious expression for exceeds the savage circle of their domestic charities. Are
not even the least of these observable in the habits and manners of the domestic Cat, who belongs
to
the Tiger general But we have even seen a Tiger in his den, who looked good-natured enough
to
be stroked and patted: and of the Lion, of whom Mr. GRIFFITH relates the following aneedote,

" Hearing some moise under his enge, the Lion passed his paw between the bars, and actually
hauled up his keeper ho was cleaning benenth; but as soon as he perceived that be had thus ill

Or what cau be said of the circumstance mentioned by SENECA (of which he was personally
vitness) of n Lion, to whom a man, who had formerly been his keeper, was exposed for destruction
in the amplutheatre at Rome and who was not only instantly recognised, but defended and
protected by the grateful benst?-Or of the story related by Du. SOUTHEY, of the Lion who had
brokien loose, submitting to the Cid, and allowing himself to be led back peaceably to his place of
confinement?
