mised to steal for you." The delighted recipient
thought how exquisitely his customer's kindness
and humour blended.
There is nothing neater in all the history of
highwaymen than this ancedote, twinkling brightly
amid the matter-of-fact records of a degenerate
day.
There is plentiful evidence that when Captain
Alexander Smith in 1719-20 wrote and publishe
his work upon the highwaymen and other evil-
doers, he based his book upon the many cha
books and broadsides then in existence. Many
of them may even now be found by those who
do not mind searching for them, but whether
they will repay the trouble is quite another
matter. He includes in his gallery even Robin
Hood and Sir John Falstaft : and, not concerned
to point out their leg indary or merely literary
character, gives an xact (though necessarily not
a truthful biograplity of each.
Several litions of Smith exist; some in three,
others in tiro volumes. The title-pages vary
!argely but all are extremely lengthy, and so

one as on the next page.
Captain Alexander Smith took an immense
delight in his villains. You cannot fail to per-
ceive, if you read his book, that his only contempt
was for a bungler in the art. Royalist to the
heart's core of him, he expends his most loving
labours upon the freebooters who displayed his
own political bias, and there can be little doubt
