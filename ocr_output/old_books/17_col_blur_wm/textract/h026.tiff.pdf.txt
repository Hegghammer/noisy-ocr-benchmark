Profact.--Introduction:
This book is mainly what those who have kindly furnished records
and sketches have made it. The whole has been carefully compiled
But genealogical works, almost of necessity, contain many efrors.
Doubtless this small work has its full share. But when errors are di
covered, notice thereof should be given, so that a second edition may
be made entirely truthful. Thankful to all who have generously givel
their assistance, this work is sent out as a small contribution
genealogical literature of the day, and in the hope that a more fell
and extensive book of Horton chronicles may be issued at no
very
distant day.
to Jan., 1876.
