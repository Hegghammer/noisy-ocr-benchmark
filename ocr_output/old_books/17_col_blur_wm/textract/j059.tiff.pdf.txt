CHAPTER VI
AND SPUNT WEAVING
Rends which are used extensively for bg
in general are procured from the sprcies of pu in Chap-
ber I. These abould mot be comfuind with the end
applied to several distince species of wate grases
Such rends are usually designated unde the of grases There
are a thousand species of palm diss buted the tropical regions
of the entire wurld, but om few are maine am the United States,
and these are of no distinct valur. The rattam or cume
of India and the Malay Talands grow to am height,
and are imported inito this country in great quantities These
tams and the trailing palm of de species Colomas have as main
export ombers Singagione and Calcutta, These are stripped
of leaves and bark and split into round and fat strips of different
diammeters and The outer bark, whan stripged into proger
sines, is an chair came: the entire palim with
is commercially as rattam and the far rends are frequently
sold an fat rattam and gûth came. to these flat and round
stript, split from the plant and exported under the insurme of
rattum are called rends, we shall refer to them under that marme in
all discussions to follow. There are qualities of reed on the
marker sold under the nume of Chima end and Germam rend. The
former is inferior in quality and the latter in sugerior, bring strong,
sough and durable. The Philiggime Islands give promise of pro
ducing a Liberal supply of reed of gond quality that is claimed to
ingual the German product. The problem, hownver, is eme of gath-
ering and markerting the product, The government has made a
partial survey of the ruitam supply, and this justifies the belief that
the Islands will eventually compete with the world market.
