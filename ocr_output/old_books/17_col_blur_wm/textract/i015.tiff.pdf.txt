Remember that they know not what they do
Who strike in deadly fear and ghastly hate;
Remember that somehow, and at some time,
Each crime exacts its human penalty.
Remember that man's conscience and man's mind
Are agents of Thy purpose and Tb plan.
Which work within a deadlire reve uge
Than any shrapnel shot or sobre thrust.
Remember that ge N COUL
Upon whom fall the burder and the eurse,
The anguish of old A tred and past wrongs,
The crushing debi, the truggle and despair.
Restrain, O God the sweep of this vast hate;
Recall the nation. Lo their sense of shame:
To those in blinding war, to us at peace,
Reveal anew the message of the Christ.
