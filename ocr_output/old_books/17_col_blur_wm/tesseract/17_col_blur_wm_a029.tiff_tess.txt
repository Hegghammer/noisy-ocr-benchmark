PART L
THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN.

Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe at t)e fo nous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the still more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel in history.

In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the Qemorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the cre Goyermuents of Europe,
bat in the iataceats of Humanity there should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlina written in leiters of blood
(Armenian blood).

It was a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of “ the
terrible streagheld of Kars,” universally admitted > be one of the greatest
and most difficult military exploits ever achieved, and the crowning success
of the Russian arms in Asiatic Turkey, shoul’ have becn accomplished by
an Armenian General; that although Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest, ai Armemay soldiers fought, conquered and
died, yet by these successes not oaly was no amelioration attained of the
hard fate of their uniipgy nation under Turkish rule, but that fate, hard
before, was made a tnlredfold and even a thousandfold harder.
