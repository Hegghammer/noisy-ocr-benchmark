It is wakd that Marnalas Horton I. was large in statere, and of a
ruddy complexion, amd of fine social qualities.

Ilis tomlmtone is of English blac marble, five feet long and about
three fect wile. It is placed horizontally over the grave. ‘The stone
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It bs clevated about cighteen inches from the grouml, on a good stone
base. ‘The original tase was of brick, bet it had! all crambled
many years ago. The present base was pot ander the Mone
time it was re-letterad by Jonathan G. Horton.

‘The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and
follows :

“Ihewe Beth barbed the teely of Ma. Mamxanse How whe
Moaety, Letcetershane, hd Mingfamd, amd decd at the a
July, 1680, aged So years.”

It is this epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with the imeripsion, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only ome of the original _
thirteen who brought his tomiatone with him, and this Gct seems to
indicate a commendable devre to wc that his name and memory
shouk! not perish from the carth.
