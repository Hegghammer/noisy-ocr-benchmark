16 HALFHOURS WITH THE HIGHWAYMEN
entrusted to her keeping by a farmer attending
the market. To convince Ratsey how trusted
@ person she was, she foolishly showed where she
had placed the bag; and as soon as her back was
turned he had taken it from the cupboard where
it lay, and made off.

When the farmer returned and wanted bis \
money, there was the very deuce to pay. He ond
the landlady went off to the nearest justior an’
swore an information against Gamalicl, who was
arrested and thrown into prison, but sot before he
had found time to return home end bury the bag
in the garden. In confidence }« told his mother
where it was hid, his mother told his sister, his
sister told her husband, her husiand told his
friends, and so at last the coufession reached the
ears of the justices. Gamliel would undoubtedly
have been hanged on tit occasion, only he broke
prison and escaped, clad only in his shirt.

His forther ,advertures with Snell and
Shorthose, $vo companions of like inclination,
are in themselves amusing when reduced to less
stilted Janguies than that of the Life. Curiously
excugh, one of these incidents is concerned with
the robbing of an actor, whom Ratsey bids deliver
his money first, and a scene from Hamlet after-
wards. So it was not from any want of acquaint-
ance with the best models that the unnamed
author of Ratsey’s life failed to put life into
his narrative. The incident is treated in as dead
and wooden a manner as the rest.
