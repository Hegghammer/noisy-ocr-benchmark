PREFACE

Tue subject which we have here treated ix a sor’ of ‘gurative
battle-ficld, where fierce contests have for ages bees from (uae to time
waged; and, notwithstanding the determinci «aults of the attacking
hosts, the contention and its cause remain pretty much as they were at the
commencement of the war. We ir the moter remain strictly neutral,

: merely performing the part of the pul '-’s “owu correspondent,” making
it our duty to gather together aach «traci from despatches, both ancient
and modern, as may prove interesumg or important, to take note of the
vicissitudes of war, mzrk its yorso phases, and, in fine, to do our best
to lay clearly befrre cur reoders the historical facts—experiences and
argument: .rela\ ng t <)> mucn-discussed “ Corset question.”

As mos of our rewlers are aware, the leading journals especially
inten lo! for the peren! of ladies have been for many years the media
for the exiuoye of a vast aumber of letters and papers touching
uve use of the Corset. The questions relating to the history of
this apporcatly indispenmble article of ladies’ attire, its construction,
application, and influence on the figure have become so numerous of late
that we have thought, by embodying all that we can glean and garner
relating to Corsets, their wearers, and the various costumes worn by
ladies at different periods, arranging the subject-matter in its due order
as to dates, and at the same time availing ourselves of careful illustration |
when needed, that an interesting volume would result. |
