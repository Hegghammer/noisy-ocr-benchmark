DUN 19
as the town was named, ic. the “ hill-staple”
or market, and his successors were often there.
The wool market was the most important at
Dunstable; the monks long maintaining great
flocks of sheep on the adjacent downs.

The robbers became only a memory, but a
memory that never faded. It merely took oa
another form, and in the course of time the nome
of the town itself was twisted into an s)iusion
to them and to their leader. It needed the ool-
lusion of gross ignorance and wild legend to effect
so much, but the thing was done; and fop cen-
turies Dunstable was, and perhaps even now is,
locally said to owe its name to “ Dun’s Stable,”
a hollow in the chalk dowys, pointed out as having
been the place where “ Dun,” the entirely ima-
ginary leader of the outlows, «tabled his hore.
If you doubt this ther® is the town seal to con-
vince the sceptical, showipg as it does what is
said to be » horseshoe (@ shoe of Dun’s horse!),
but is really intended for a staple or hasp.

The legendary Dun was a kind of bogey to
the children of the neighbourhood, and in John-
sou’) pores is a most bloodthirsty creature.
There we read that his first exploit was on the
highway to Bedford, where he met a waggon full
of corn, going to market, drawn by a fine team
of horses. He accosted the waggoner, and in the
midst of conversation stabbed him to the heart
withadagger. He buried the body, and drove the
waggon off to the town, where he sold the corn
and the waggon as well, and then disappeared |
