JSrom Smith, who himself was prone to inelude
” the most extravagant myths in his pages, calls
hia folio A Gexewat axp True Ilisrony or
the Lives axp Acrions or tae Mosr Pamous
Hicuwayrmes. Both of them inelude pirates and
murderers. Of the “trath” of much in
and Johnson, the less said the better.

of almost insuperable difficully
JSrom fiction, and beoanse of «a
i that it would be a thankless task
to the highwayman aa he really waa: a
Sellow rarely heroic, generally foul-mouthed and
ernel, and oflen cowardly. No novelist would
be likely to thank the frank historian for this dis-
sercice ; and I do nol think the historian who came
to the subject in this cold scientific apiril of a
demonstrator in surgery would be widely read.
