mother of Brutus, was presented with a pair by Julius Caxor, the value
of which was £48,457,
Bracelets are also ornaments of high antiquity, as are ring) and
brooches of various forms for fastening the dress.
Rich gold chains and jewelled fastenings were ip common wre during
this period. The annexed illustration represen's a floman lady of
rank about the reign of Heliogabalus. Little alteration appeors to have
taken place in the general style of costume for some very comiderable

all that has been written aboui (he purely aatural and statuesque forms
of the Roman matroas. Ov the conquest of the Roman Empire by the
wild and savage Hunnis): trib, feshiow, art, taste, literature, and civilisa-
tion were swepx rochlee’y away, and a long, weird night of mental
darkness may be wid to bere seigned throughoup the land from the
tenth to the midile ot he Gfteenth century, and we see little or nothing
of Koman clegance or magnificence of dress to distinguish it above other
