6 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

and carnivorous habits. They walk on their toes: yet not so much from that habitual stealthiness
of pace, by which they advance unpereeived till within a spring of their prey ; as because it is also
the means of that celerity of motion which is necessary to the very existence of animals that can
fleed only on flesh.

Their claws are exceedingly powerful ; and they are enabled to draw them up into sheaths
between their toes, so as to prevent their points from touching the ground; whence they are
called retractile ; and those claws are, in consequence, always kept sharp, unworn, and ready for
active service.

The eyes of the Feline tribe—of every face in nature a striking and important feature—vary
in the different species, and are capable of much alteration in the/same animal ; as instinctive
impulse, or internal emotion, changes the expression i 3 and also from the
degrees of light which act upon their pupils. Of Lions are circular, and
not of a yellow colour, as has been stated in the ions on the
Carnivora, but black. It is the iris of the Lion's is They appear to be best
suited to nocturnal, or twilight, vision; and hence the rarely his prey while the sun
is above the horizon—perbaps never, but w! in an extraordinary degree.
The Tiger, on the contrary, will seek his l night ; and during twilight the
colour of his eyes is that of a blue-green near a Tiger in a menagerie,
the colour of the animal's eyes will time ly, from yellow-green to blue-green ;
not from any alteration in the deg: them, but from mental excitement, and
from a certain natural facilit pansion am@contraction of the eye-pupils.

Hence a characteristic differene)) betwee » the Lion and the Tiger. The habits of the latter
are diurnal, and he di ht-firegs the Lion, on the contrary, whose eyes are not calculated
for the glare of day,/eunno to encounter fire-light at night. Yet these physical conforma-
tious are someti ercome b rage of hunger; and hence, in Mn. Epwin Lanpsuxn’s
contending group jon is represented as attacking the Tiger although it be day.
