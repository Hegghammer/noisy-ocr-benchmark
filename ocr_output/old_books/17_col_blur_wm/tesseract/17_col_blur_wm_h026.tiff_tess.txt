xIV Preface. â€”latrntuction,

This book ix mainly what tho who have kindly farnished records
amd sketches have made it. The whole has been carefully compiled.
Ret genealogical works, almomt of necewity, contain many errors.
Doubslow this small work has its fell share. Dat when errors are
covered, notice thereof showk! be given, so that a second edition
he made entirely truthfal. Thankfel to all who have gencroudy
thelr amistance, this work is sent out as a small contribution
genealogical literature of the day, and in the hope that a more
amd extensive book of Horton chronicles may be
distant day.
