Before weaving, the butt ends of the leaves are cut off about a
foot from the base. These are too course and stiff to weave proper

make a strand. Three leaves make a coarse strand, two a medium,
and one a fine strand. A long, tight twist is necessary to produce
an even, smooth strand. The twisting is always done in one direc-
tion. One leaf is recommended for beginners in rush seating, for
adding to one is much simpler than adding to several. The under
side of the seat need not be as smooth and as well woven as the top
In fact, twisting need not be done underneath at all unless the
individual worker so desires.
Raffia is easy to manipulate because of its pliability, even when
dry. Several lengths will need to be twisted together to produce a
