DISINTERESTED EVIDENCE.
I have thought it advisable to insert a few extracts from accounts of
the Massacres of April, 1909, given by disinterested witnesses.
"We are having a perfectly hideons time here. Thousands have been murdered-2000
in this province they say; but the number is probably greater, for every Christian village
was wiped out In Adans about 5000 have perishel. After Turks and Armenian
made pence, the Turks came in the night with hose and kerosene, and set fire to what reminol
of the Armenian quarter. Next day the French and Armenian schools were fired, Nearly every
one in the Armenian school perished, anybody trying to cacape being shot down by thesoldies
"The Turkish Authorities do nothing except arrest unoffending Armenians, from whom
by torture they extort the most fanciful conferions. Even the woondol are not afe from
their injustice. A man was being carried in to me yesterday when he was tol and taken
off to gaol. I dare not think what his fate may be.
For fiends incarnate commend me to the Turks. Nobody is safe from them. They
murder babies in front of their mothers; they half murder on, and violate the wives while
the husbands are lying there dying in pools of blood."
"The authorities did nothing, and the soldiers were worse than the crowd, for they were
better armed. One house in our quarter was burned with 115 people inside. We counted
the bodies. The soldiers set fire to the door, and the windows had iron bars, nobody
could get out. Everybody in the house was roaste alive. They were all women and
children and old people."-Extract from letter of Mrs. Doughty-Wylie, wife of British Consul
at Adana; published in the London “Daily Mail."
IN THIS HOUSE 115 WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ROASTED ALIVE.
History repeats itself. In 1895 Turkish soldiers fell upon seventy to eighty young
women and girls in a church, where they had fled for refuge, and after hikously outraging
them, barricaded them in, setting fire to the building at the same time, and derisively shouting
to their victims as they were being roasted alive, to call upon their Christ to save them now
