THE CHILD OF THE MOAT

erally allowed to go out after dinner and amuse them-
selves, but it was a wet day and Aline was looking
disconsolately out of the window wondering whether
she should go into the library or what she should de
when the angry dame thought that the child offered
an object for the further exereise of her power "WAY
are you idling there!" she said. "They are ali hort-

Aline gave a little gasp of surprise, but ran off at

drinking and offering a tenkand te one of the other
servants, and she heard him sugh oudly as he pointed
to a row of goblets, four of the elean and the rest of
them dirty, while be sa Edward cleaned those, and

a dozen of these goblets, bring me the others."
"Yes, Mistress," said Thomas, triumphantly, "but
they were all dirty and I have just cleaned these."
Mistress Mowbray saw that she could not catch him
