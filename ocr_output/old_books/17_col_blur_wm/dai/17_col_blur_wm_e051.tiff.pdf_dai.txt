THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.
45
Fairies, and attendant ladies are described. Of two of the latter it
is said
"Their kirtles were of rede cendel,
I laced smalle, jollyf, and well,
There might none gayer go.”
In the French version of the same poem it is, we read more fully
expressed. It says, "They were richly habited and very tightly laced."
The Lady Triamore is thus described :---
"The lady was in a purple pall,
With gentill bodye and mile small."
Wharton quotes from an ancient poem, which he believes to date as
far back as 1200, in which a lover, speaking of the object of his
admiration, thus throws down the gunlet of challenge, and exclaims-—
"Middle her ab ath menik small."
The word menik or waist being used instead of very or much. Some
differences of opinion have existed among writers as to the origin of the
word corset. Some are of opinion that the French words corps, the
body, and jerrer (to tightly inclose or incase), led to the adoption of
the term. Madame La Sante gives it as her opinion, however, that it is
move probably a corruption of the single word corps, which was formerly
written cor and may be taken as a diminutive form of it. Another
view of the matter has been that the name of a rich material called
cors, which was at one time extensively used in the manufacture of
corsets, may have been thus corrupted. This is scarcely probable, as
the word corset was in use at too early a period to admit of that origin,
Perhaps as early an instance of the use of the term corset as any in
existence may be found as a portion of an entry in the household register
of Eleanor, Countess of Leicester, which bears the date May 24, 1265:-
