THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
And that is the way that the story of The Boy
Apprenticed to an Enchanter used to begin.
But first I shall have to tell you about Kg
Manus and his three horses.
King Manus ruled over the Western Isl , und
he had a castle that was neither higher no wia ›
than any other King's castle. But head atable
that was more strongly built than any oth King's
stable. It had double walls on it had oak
beams; it had an irop doo waour locks to it.

swords in their han tayed right and day.
In those days, ont before a King and
asked him for a rift the King might not refuse to
give what
wed of him. But King Manus
was hard to come to by those with requests. For
before the chamber where he sat or slept there
stood a servant to take the request, and if it were
one that might not be brought to him, to make an
excuse for the King.
It was all because of the King's three horses —
a white horse, a red horse, and a black horse.
The white horse was as swift as the plunging wave
