arms from around my neck, and my brothers
kissed me farewell. Then the man from the
strange boat opened the door of our wattled me
and went out, and I followed him.
We did not go back to the place where e
left his boat of brass. We went to other place
where there was a harbor with ships. There we
found a ship ready to sail for Uth.
My master sent me on ord to ask the cap-
tain if he would take us on aoyage beyond Urth.
The captain said the if master would guide
them past the Mamether he would give him the
ship to sail where held after the cargo had been
landed. My master sid he would do this, and we
went on the ship. It was evening now, and
a breeze came p, and the ship sailed away,
bringing from the place where I was born and
reared and toward the strange countries that were
beyond the rim of the sea. I asked one of the
sailors what was the Magnetberg, and he told me
that it was a mountain of loadstone that drew the
iron out of ships that came near it and left them
loosened timbers upon the water.
