THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
story-teller's place and fresh candles were lighted
and set upon the table.
“Your danger is great," said the King, “
will be hard for you to show us that you ATC
ever in such danger before. Begins
And if it is not a story of a narrow and a close
escape there will be little time let for you to pre-
pare for your death by the sword.”
Thereupon the youth in the foreign dress looked
long into the wine cup that as handed him, and
he drank a draughs of the wine, and he saluted
the King and the lord who sat by the King, and
he said:
“Once I was greater danger, for its mouth
was
come, and no hope whatever was given
of Lay saving my life. I will tell the story,
and you all judge whether my danger then was
greater than is my danger now.'
And thereupon the youth in the foreign dress,
who had tried to steal the white horse that King
Manus owned, began the story which is set down
here in the very words in which he told it.
