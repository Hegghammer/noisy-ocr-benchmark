CHAPTER III
HATE AND LOVE
A
LINE certainly did not belong to any oinary
type and she would have puzzled the psychol-
ogist to classify. She was so many sed as to
be in a class by herself. She had plenty of common
sense and intelligence for he years ad an outlook
essentially fair minded and ju. But also had a
quiet hauteur, curiously coupled with humility, and at
the same time a win ng manner that was irresistible;
so that the strange thing was that she had only to ask
and most people voluntarily aitted to her desires.
This unusual power t have been very dangerous
to her character and spoiled her, had it not been that
what she wanted almost always just and reason-
able and moreover she never used her power for her
own benefit. Further, her humble estimate of her own
capacity for judgment caused her but rarely to exercise
the power at all. In practice it was almost confined
to those cases where a sweet minded child's natural in-
stinet for fair play sees further than the sophistries of
the adult.
She was practically unaware of this power, which
was destined to bring her into conflict with Eleanor
Mowbray; nor did she take the least delight, as she might
easily have done, in exercising power for power's sake.
