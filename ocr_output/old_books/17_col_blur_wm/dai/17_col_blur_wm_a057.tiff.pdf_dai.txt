Church, but was also a fearless patriot-a distinguished linguist, an eloquent preacher, and a
thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the fearol fanatical uprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the wind and took
a step that will long be remembered in the anuals of Armenian history,
At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were the bestuck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constantinople, a
by Monseigneur Nerces, the Patriarch, their object being to request the signatory Powers of
the Berlin Treaty to force a guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.
Abdul Hamid and his advisers were furious at this affront, and Monseigneur Nerces was
summoned to the Palace. It is said that when he received the son be simply smiled
and asked one of of his curates to read the Barial Service to
return alive. However, he went. No one has ever heard what passed between the Sultan
and himself at the interview; suffice it to say that he immediately summoned the Armenian
General Assembly and tendered his resignation. This wi not accepted by the Assembly,
and, amidst enthusiastic cheers, he was carried back to his apartments at the Patriarchate.
Meanwhile a peremptory order reached him, signed by the Sultan, to recall the Armenian
delegation from Berlin. This Monseigneur Varjabétian paint-blank refused to do, and retired
to his private residence at Haskeuy, a village on the Golden Horn. The success of the dele
gation, however, did not come up to his expectations. The Arscians, as it happened, could
not be heard, hat they were so far successful to have an article inserted in the treaty.
The Sultan and his advisers never forgave the Patiarch this, though they could not
openly do anything to him on account of his errous popularity. Time passed on, and to
all appearance the incident was fortion, but it was not so. One summer afternoon a most
cordial invitation was sent by a very high dignitary of the Palace, requesting the Archbishop
to dine with him informally. An invitation of this kind could not very well be refusol, so
the Archbishop, accompaniel only bodyervant named Vartan, repaired to the Pasha's
house. The Fasha received him at the door and escorted the visitor with much ceremony and
extreme courtesy to a private apartment of the salamlik of his house (the men's quarters),
where dinner was served. The geniality displayel by his host dispelled any fears that the
Archbishop sight have had as to his personal safety.
After dier, usual, colle as served. Now, this serving of the coffee is rather a

of his coffee. The Archbishop was presented with a "tehooboak" (pipe) fille
and lighted for smoking, and a servant followed with coffee. The Archbishop accepted both
with due compliments to his host, and took a sip at his coffee. Just at that moment the
heavy curtains over the doorway were thrown apart, revealing the glastly pale face of his
servant Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, in a voice trembling with emotion, “Monseigneur,
I did not brew the coffee!"
This was enough for the Archbishop; he pretended to be startled and spilt the coffee, but,
alas! he had already drunk a small quantity of it. Meanwhile a seulle was going on behind
the portière, where his poor servant Vartan was paying the penalty of his devotion to his
master. Concerning Vartan's whereabouts or his ultimate end nothing was ever made public
-the poor fellow simply vanished. Monseigneur Varjabétian, after a short interval thanked
the Pooha for his generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily summoned. The Patriarch took to his bed,
and lost all his hair through the effects of the poison. Then, one morning, when a servant
