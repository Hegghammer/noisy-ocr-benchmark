THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER

came on without sails or oars. It was a shining
boat, a boat of brass. I called to my father and
my father straightened himself up and watched it
In the boat that came toward us of its own accor
there was Ã  man standing.
The boat came into the full water between the
rocks, and then it sank down, this best of bess, un-
til its rim touched the water. It remed still as
if anchored. The man who was in the prow of the
boat stepped out on the sind etwe n my father
and me.
He looked a man of high degree
- like a prince
or a potentare. a tark face and a dark,
curly beard, and heades that were like hawks'
eyes. Nad on straight coat of a blue
material were all over with curious figures,
and in hand he held a long polished staff
that had the shape of two serpents twisting to-
gether. He looked at me and I was frightened of
him, and I turned to my father. But my father
was standing there, holding the fishing pole in
his hands, his mouth open, gasping like one of the
fishes upon the rocks.
