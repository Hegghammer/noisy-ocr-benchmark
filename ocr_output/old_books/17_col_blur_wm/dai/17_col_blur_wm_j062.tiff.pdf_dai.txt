BEAT WEAVING
4 hours. Remove it from the tub and wash thoroly in running
water. The best way to do this is to lay the reed on an inclined
surface and turn a forceful stream of water upon it. Chloc of
lime has a bad effect upon the hands in that it makes them
tender, so care must be taken to properly rinse the reed. A little
talow rubbed over the hands will materially offer the namry to
tenderness, and generally keep them in good condition
Staining-Bleached reed takes stain
readily and
evenly than does the natural or unbleached. It may
color with prepared stains, but endily the brave the reed
muddy in appearance due primely
rulty in brushing in
or wiping off the stain in the reces waving leaves, Per-
haps the best agent for oing revan east a very desirable
ene, especially after it has be is naptha. The preparation
coloring is as follows: Obtain the
necessary amount and variety colors ground in oil; mix the re-
quired colors with a little maps them to determine the shade of
coler test with a reed. Reed absorbs a given amount of color,
therefore the shade will prove out practically the same when tested
with a small quantity of mapcha, as when tried out with a greater
amount. Add the required amount of naptha to the solution, avoid-
ing thinning too much; otherwise the color produced will be "sickly"
in appearance. Five pounds of color to about 3 gallons of nageha
will prove about the right ratio. For instance, to obtain a rich nut
brown mix 1 pound of chrome yellow and 5 pounds of burnt umber
with a small amount of naptha. Stir until the colors are liquid,
them gradually add & gallons or so of nageha, and stir well. The
intensity of the brown may be varied by using more or less chrome
yellow
Coiled hanks of reed may be immersed in the solution, immedi-
ately withdrawn and hung to drain dry above the receptacle, thes
permitting surplus stain to drain back into it. The stain may be
used repeatedly, and as it is very volatile it should be kept in a
tightly corked red can when not in use. It is also highly inflam-
