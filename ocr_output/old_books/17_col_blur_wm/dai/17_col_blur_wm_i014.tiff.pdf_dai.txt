THE ZONE
a
Avert Thy gaze, O God, close tight Thine eyes!
Glance down no longer on the ocean foam,
Lest Thou behold such horrors as can turn
Men's burning hearts to ice, and chill tir soul
Keep Thine heart warm and full of charity
That Thou mayst yet be able to forgive
And pity feel for those who know not when
To pause in deeds of rushless rifio
Restrain Thy wrth, and keep Thine hand in
check;
Smite pot, nor Cercely that without the pale
Those who can due to strew the ocean waste
With fellow creatures, innocent of wrong.
Forget the studied purpose to destroy;
The launching of the missile through the deep;
The shattered hull; the crushed and bleeding forms;
The seething swirl of wreckage, women, men.
