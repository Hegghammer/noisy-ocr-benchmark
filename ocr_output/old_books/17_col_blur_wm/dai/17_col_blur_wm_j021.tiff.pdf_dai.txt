CANING SUGGESTIONS
U.
boles are bored and utilized in the cane weaving. These are not
abolutely necessary; in fact caned areas on many pieces of period
and modern furniture do not utilize corner holes. In such instances
two diagonal strands are run in each hole on either side of
corner. A comparison of the areas, the one employing
hole, and the other not, will lead the observer to conclude
former appears complete while the latter appears
from
It is frequently necessary or desirable
to cover up the cane on the back or inside
of an article. This is true of places es
posed to view, and is especially anal
on such pieces of furniture as

of William and Mary desigwa
in a school shop, is hand canel, and of mahogany. The exposed
cane is covered with strips of
in which a groove 36 in, deep and in, wide has been run. This
groove may be made with saw, chisel, or combination plane. Fig. 8
shows a sketch of such a strip. It makes a neat, pleasing cover.
Many pieces of so-called expensive furniture have ragged, exposed
caning. This is unsightly and is not to be commended
Wherever it is found desirable to leave cine natural, it is neces
sary that the frame be stained before caning is begun. Box feming
will not permanently color cane. Oil stains make no appreciable
impression if rubbed off at once. But water, acid, and alcohol
stains produce decided colors. If the worker desires to color the
cane approximately the same shade as the article, the caning may
be done on the white wood and the entire article stained at the one
operation. Cane may be shellacked or varnished or left natural,
as desired
Irregular Areas-Fig. 9 shows a close view of the back of the
chair illustrated in Fig. 7. This is a typical example of an irregular-
shaped area for caning. The principles of weaving remain the
