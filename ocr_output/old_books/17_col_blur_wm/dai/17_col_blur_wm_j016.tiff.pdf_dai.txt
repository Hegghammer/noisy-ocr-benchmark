Stop The actual weaving begins with this step. It may by
done entirely by hand, without resort to the needle, but it is slow
work. The needle should be used. Start at a hole next to a corner
on either rail that has been used but se, working from caned side
toward the open frame. Go over and under the strands necessary
to form the weave, turning the needle from side to side in order to
catch the canes behind the point. When across thread the needle
with the strand and pull thru, being careful to avoid a twist. Pull
the end down thru the hole, pairing the canes. Pall the came up
thru the next bole; then start the needle from the opposite side of
the frame and repeat the first operation, thus pairing another set
of canes. Continue until all canes are paired and all holes used.
Soak the woven came with a wet sponge, and with two pegs
