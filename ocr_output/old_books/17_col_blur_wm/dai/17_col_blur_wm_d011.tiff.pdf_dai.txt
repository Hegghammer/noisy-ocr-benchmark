PREFACE
On the analogy of the famous apple, "there ar
going to be no" preface, "not nohow." Children do
not read prefaces, so anything of a prefatory nature
that might interest them is put at the beginning of chap-
ter one.
As for the grown-ups the story is not written for grown-
ups, and if they want to know why it begs with such a
gruesome first chapter, let the the children. Chil-
dren like the horrors first and the end all right. Many
grown-ups like the tragedy at the end. But perhaps the
children are right and the groups are standing on
their heads. Besides they can skip the first chapter; it is
only a prologue
