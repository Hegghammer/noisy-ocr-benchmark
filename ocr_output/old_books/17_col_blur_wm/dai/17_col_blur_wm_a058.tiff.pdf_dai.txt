took his breakfast upstairs he found, to his horror, that both the bedroom door and the
window were wide open and his beloved master lay dead in his bed, which was covered with
blood! There are no such things as coroners and juries in Turkey to ascertain the causes of
mysterious deaths of this kind, but the news that the Patriarch was dead spread like wildfire
through Constantinople. The Saltan himself thought it advisable to show some concern in
the matter, and aides-de-camp from the Palace were sent to the Patriarchate to learn the fall
details of this "sal catastrophe," as they termol it. The official statement was that the
Archbishop died of dysentery. Only a very few know how the Archbishop ad diol, and
they wisely kept their mouths shut.
I was told the details of this story by a high official of the Armenian Patriarchate. It
seans that as the poison did not act as quickly as the Patriarch's enemies and anticipatel,
owing to his having been cautioned in the nick of time, they had to resort to other means
The funeral was the largest ever witnessed in Constantinople, with an escort of Turkish
cavalry sent specially by the Saltan, and representatives of all the religi den minations
and the Diplomatic Corps. I was myself present, representing a reiz Government.
