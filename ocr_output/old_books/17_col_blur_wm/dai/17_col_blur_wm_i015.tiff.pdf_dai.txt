Remember that they know not what they do
Who strike in deadly fear and ghastly hate;
Remember that somehow, and at some time,
Each crime exacts its human penalty.
Remember that man's conscience and man's mind
Are agents of Thy purpose and The pian,
Which work within a deadlice revenge
Than any shrapnel shot or sobre thrust.
Remember that w geration COM
Upon whom fall the burden and the curse,
The anguisk of old hatred past wrongs,
The crushing debs, the struggle and despair.
Restrain, O God, the sweep of this vast hate;
Recall the nations to their sense of shame:
To those in blinding war, to us at peace,
Reveal anew the message of the Christ.
