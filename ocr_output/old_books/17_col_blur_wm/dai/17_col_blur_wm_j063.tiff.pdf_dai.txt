ERED AND SPLINT WEAVING

right consistency, the reed will dry rapidly and the color ili

A woven article such as a basket or woven top footstool be
dipped, or the color poured over and allowed to dri dry. In
instances it is good policy to wipe surplus sexin off light. Then,
in the case of the footstool or similar proti
desires he may stain the wood a darker shode than the top with a
prepared stain. Reed is very effective without stas many of the
stools shown herewith are left natural, ed my be shellacked or

Other Materials-Reed the only good medium adapted
to weaving, either in correlation with wood or when used alone.
On the stools illustrated several other materials have been used,
as inner hickory bark and Indian splints and fiber. Binding cane,
ope, and even willow may be stilined with success. Paper Sher

Sufficient to say that this her adages itself admirably to almost
all work where reed is commonly employed, and in many instances
is, commercially, supplanting reed.
Inner hickory bark may be obtained of manufacturers of rustic
furniture either directly or indirectly. They may be obtained first
hand if hickory trees grow in the locality, thus enhancing the edu-
cational value of weaving. In the spring or early summer when
the sap is up and the bark slips easily, a hickory tree may be cut
down, and the rough outer bark shaved with a draw knife from
the top of the log the full length of the trunk, leaving a surface
from 8 in. to 10 in, wide. With a heavy knife split the inner bark
on either side of the shaved strip; then beginning at one end peel
