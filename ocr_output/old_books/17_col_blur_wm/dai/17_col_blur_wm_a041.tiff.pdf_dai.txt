like a round how, a great brown eye revealed the inward spirit's intelligence and zeal un-
quenched. On his head was a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.
Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest men--M grditeh
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armeniz people slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or "The Oly-Begotten
is Descended." From the window of a neighboring room he might have looked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now all cut close and haviol for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling snow and hur kane that hid the
cone of Ararat. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last podle of the Deluge. On the
shore of that lake, eighty-seven years ago, Khrimian was born. In 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land; the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Greece from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the genes champs of freedom-a
reputation which still rather pathetically survives throughout the Near East. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos now looked back, bet not unhappy, for
from first to last it had been inspired by one alsorbing and selfisk aithe freedom and
regeneration of his people. It is true he had failed
From his earliest years, when he had witnessed the terrors of Turkish oppresion in the
homes of Armenians round Ararat, he was posed by the spirit of nationality-sach a
spirit as only kindles in oppressed racos, but des ay into aygoing tolerance among the
prosperous and contented of the world. He began poet, wandering far and wide through
the Turkish, Persian, and Rassian sections Armenia, visiting Constantinople and Jerusalem,
and recalling to his people by his poems scenes and glories of their national history,
Entering the monastic order after his wife's death, he devoted himself to the building of schools,
which be generously threw open to Kurd, the beveitary assassins of Armenians. For many
years, while Europe was recupied with Crimu wars, Austrian wars, or French and German
wars, we see hita ceasele journeying from Van to Constantinople and through the
cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though continually defeated, his schools burned, his
printing-presses broken up, his sacred emlems of the Host hung in mockery round the necks
of dogs. When elected Armenian patriarch of Constantinople (1869), he was driven from
his office after four years
But the cup of Turkish insity was filling. The pitiless slaughter of Bulgations and
Armenians alike was ore than even the European Powers could stand. With varied motives,
Rels sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himmed to lead his people's cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Europe
beforand, them to create an autonomous neutral state for Armenia, as they had
home with success for the Lebanon. In London he became acquainted with Gladstone; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and,
in the Chagress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 6 dolging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kunds in chock and
enforce Turkey's definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observol. Beaconsfield returned to London amid shouts of "Pence with Honor,"
and Armenia was left to stew.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake
