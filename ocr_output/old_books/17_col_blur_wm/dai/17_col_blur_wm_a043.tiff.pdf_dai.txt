distinctly
called a powerful nation. For almost as long they have possessed no independent country of
their own. For six hundred years their ancient capital city of Ani has stood a splendid bat
empty rain in the desert between Kars and the great mountain of Alagi, which confronts
Ararat, with nearly equal height. They have been rent asunder and tormented by Penis,
Tarks, Tartars, and Russians in turn. Even their religion is not nationalistic
separate from other forms of religion, like the Jewish. Except for metaphysical
difference, hardly comprehensible to the modern world, there is little to distinguish it from the
orthodox Christianity of the Near East. Yet, through innumerable disasters and accepts
at extermination, the race persists, like the Jews, with astonishing vitality, istakable in
characteristics which may not be exactly heroic, but lead to a certain enterial success. After
all, it is only in harassed and persecuted nationalities that trae patrictions ever survives.
