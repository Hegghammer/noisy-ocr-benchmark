CANING: THE SEVEN STEPS

necewary for marking. Several wood pegs are needed. These

or the equivalent. Cut them about 4 in. long and point shem

of pegs. Four should prove amply sufficient

However, any rectangular

It is assumed that the sides
of the rest have been fitted. The
rails and stiles are then assembled
with glue, without the posts. When the glue has set the proper
length of time, and the frame is cleaned and sanded, the rails and
stiles are ready to dimension,
Draw pencil lines entirely around the inner sides of the rails and
stiles, in from the edges. This distance remains constant,
usually, on all areas and with canes the various widths. With a
pair of dividers set at Â½ in space off points on the pencil lines,
starting from the intersection of the extended lines on each rail.

It will make clearer the directions. It is fundamental that the
spacing be done in the same direction on parallel rails, for at times
