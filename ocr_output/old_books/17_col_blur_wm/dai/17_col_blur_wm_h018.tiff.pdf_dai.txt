Preface-Introduction
It is said that Barnabas Horton I. was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities
His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It is elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. The original base was of brick, but it had all crumbled down
many years ago. The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Horton.
The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads
follows:
"Here lieth buried the body of MR. BARNABAS HORTON
Mousely, Leicestershire, Old England, and died at South on the day of
July, 1680, aged So years."
In the centre of the stone we find the Epitaph, as follows:
Here lies my body tombed in dat
"Till Christ shall com it with the just;
My soul ascended
ke abode:
Then hasten er dear wife,
To be partaker
children, all follow the Lord,
His sacred word;
upon
have bivised you to the same
bless you with your children all,
And to this blessed place He will you call."
Hels, xixHe being dead, yet speaketh."
It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the original
thirteen who brought his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and memory
should not perish from the earth.
