PREFACE

Most of NS like to keep a few of the illusious
ICE belieced in when schoolboys. Scientifie his-
torious have degraded wany of our aucient heroes
and exalted the cillains, for tchow of old NO
mad ICUS too thick and slab. Beliefs are being
on ecery side. To abolish the traditional
courtesy of Clande Du Vall or the qusiderate
conduct of Coptoin Hind mould, the
are,
be
strokes of the makindest, and I huce here at
afed
no such iconoclasm Even there I caus
liete, I hace told the tale-icheneeer il has
morth the telling-(18 il is found in crim
trials, or in Smith or and other
sources, decoroualy stripped of much cile loy
For really, shère mesch that seems
mory be fully proced, and achere
tarus out not rarely to be false,
To continue the story of the high
Smith and Johnson dowe to the approit
of all such things in the beginning of the
leenth century, is like taking up and
a half-told tale. But it the doing.
Only in respeel of the great figure Turpin has
alwoys maile, has it been found really necessary
to seriously consider and re-state the career of
that much-overrated sconndrel, and to put him
in his proper place : ( cery much lower one
than he usnally occupies.
