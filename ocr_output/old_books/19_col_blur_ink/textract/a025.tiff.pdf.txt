Further in answer to Ahmed Riza Bey's account of the Armenian
"prétendus patriotards' in connection with the Ottoman Bank : I cannot do
better than quote from Mr. Bryce's version of the story, and the massacre
that followed :

some sort of

pancy of the

many inno
was with difficulty brought to an end by
the intervent
gul. A little later the Armenian revolu-
tionary party,
in Crete, where the Christians, being
well armed and
tims, held their ground successfully,
issued appeals to
Turkish Government to introduce
reforms, threatenir
of repression and massacre
was persisted in.

on August 26, a band

suburbs. On the afternoon of the 27th the British Chargê d'Affaires (whose
action throughout won general approval) told the Sultan he would land
British sailors, and the Ambassadors telegraphed to the Sultan. Then the
general massacre was stopped, though sporadic slaughter went on round the
city during the next few days. The Ambassadors, who did not hesitate
