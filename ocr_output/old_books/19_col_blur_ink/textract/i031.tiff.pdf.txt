THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
I mean those in the staterooms. I cannot
speak with certainty in regard to the port-
holes on deck E. I believe that the first list
the ship took brought her down to these
open ports on the starboard side and that
she sank much more quickly from filling
through hem.
On my return to the deck I felt that the
steamer m st make her final plunge any mo-
ment now,
d as there was nothing more that
could be doi
n the port side-forthere - was
no discipline
order with which to do it-I
passed throu
the starboard side. Men
were striving
rer the boats and were
putting womel
iren int to them, but it
seemed to me
ded horror to
the whole situ
into a
boat that you
cleared
and which w
ne steamer;
better leave
K to let them
take their e
of wreckage.
