The efforts of the Armenians, and the entreaties of their Patriarch
Nerses had procured the insertion of Article 16 in the Treaty of San
Stefano signed between Russia and Turkey in March 1878. In fact the
wording of the Article had been suggested by the Patriarch himself. It
provided the following stipulation for the protection of the Armenians -

As the evacuation by the Rus in troops of the territory which they
now occupy in Armenia, and which
to be restored to Turkey, might give
rise to conflicts and complications
trimental to the maintenance of good
relations between the two countries
e Sublime Porte engages to carry into
effect without further delay the i
ovements and reforms demanded by
local requirements in the provine
ahabited by the Armenians, and to
guarantee their security against il
rds and Circassians."
What followed has passed it
tory. The British Government of
which Lord Beaconsfield (then 1
(sraeli) was Premier, and Lord Salis-

** It will perioditally make the steps taken to this efject to the

could furnish food for laughter were it not for the terrible tragedy involved
in it.
The insertion of Article 61 in the Treaty of Berlin, granted, or rather
scemingly granted, by the six Powers of Europe, proved in reality, as sub-
sequent events bore out, an instrument of death and torture. It was as if
the reversal of the figures had reversed the possibilities of succour and
protection, and with the death of the Czar Liberator, the last chance of the
Armenians died.
The Turkish Massacres of 1875 and 1876 which led up to the Russo-
Turkish War of 1877 are historical facts too well known to need further
