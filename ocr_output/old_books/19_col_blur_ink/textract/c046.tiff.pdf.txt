THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
pents twisting together. The end of the staff
lifted itself as though the serpents were rising
up. The dwarf covered his eyes, and cried out,
o Magus!"
"Remind me of the second dream that was
considered remarkable," said the King. And the
dwarf said, "The second dream was the Dream of
the Laden Ass."
"It is even so," said the King. "Idreamed that
I looked down the Way of the Lions, and there
came along the way a laden ass. Of that dream
also those skilled in the signification of dreams
could tell me nothing."
"And yet the dream is plain," said the En-
chanter, looking full into the eyes of the King.
"A laden ass signifies casure found - your
dream is of a treasure
ught into your
palace."
"It is so," said the ane
warf with the crown
of scarlet fenthers upon 1 lead. "In dreams an
ass is always laden with reasure."
"And what was my third dream?" said the
King.
