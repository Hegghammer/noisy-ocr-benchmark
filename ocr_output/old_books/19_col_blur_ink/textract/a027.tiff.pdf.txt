was a zace un to that time among non-Moilem peoples which with and doep freling
homored the Ottoman fatherland that was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most mearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognixe the
Ottoman country as their fatherland Besides this it is the Armeniani who engrage in
commence and agriculture, and thus, by demoustrating ite fruitfulness, increase the value of
the Ottoman Empire. Becnuse a fow asong them justly started an agitation, these our moble
and industrions brethren were being What a terrible seene! When we
left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodice of our Armenian compatriota being
removed in masure carts: lege and arms were hanging down outride. This bloody socue will
ever impressed on my mind.
- This shocking crime of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a cursed absolutism, up to the lasi moment, sprew wider. Exen during the
post nine monthe of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feeling which had been shown,
the awful events in Adana took place and the souls of all true Osmanlie melted into tears,
Up to the present time the deep connom enused by this event has not disappearod, because this
bloody wound in our social body ennuot easily be eured While we 61 our with
choice morsels, while we rest selfishly in our comfortable beds, these fotherless and brotherless
orphans, wádows hungry, maked, and harefoot wander hither and and thousande of
families are fleeing from the fatherland. Vie convinced than government is doing its
work, but what has happened is so great a alamity that le keep a government hasy for
years. However much sacrifice we nus
unko, all be inadoquate, because the
happiners of the fatherland depends on
a wounds as theie as soon as passible.
I'e are convineed that the government
with it are persuaded of this au well as
Wo naust now wipe out th
the misfortune brought by a carsol period.
We must now comfort weeping hear
must understand and teach those who do not
understand that patriotism and ben
do not differ from each other. The responsibility
of the government for the Arment
ery great and very weiglity. The whole Ottoman
mation is under obligations to pry
suffering nace, becnuso the liberty we enjoy to-day
is in large part due to the b
sod by the Armeniaus We thought that thaie truths
were 60 obvious that we prefer
keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
from time to time
all the greatnoss of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people yesterday has endured only harbarism, and for twelve years
has been constantly oppres and ground to the earth, and has given thousands of victims
Hereafter we must work awsure them that the ena of has passed, and with all our
strength
of
mind
and
we must quiet them. The obligation of the goverament to protect
them
is also very heav hecause our Armenian conntrymen live among wandering tribes,
We must all assist the government and point out its obligation. It must be declared in
pablic and periodically that the one of the most important duties of the Ottoman nation is to
protect, together with those of other naces, the interesta, the life, and property of the
Armenians as well, since those are their sacrol rights. Let investigations be and let
whatever is necossary be done in order to reach this aim."
This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare disclose
his identity : and the account given by an authority like Mr. James Bryce
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as "les Massacres occasionnés par les aventuriers Arméniens."
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
