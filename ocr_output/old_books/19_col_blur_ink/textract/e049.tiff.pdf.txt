Hersvingian and Carlovingian dresses paid any attention to the
formation of the waist or its display. But during the ninth century we
find the dresses worn extremely tight, and so made as to define the waist
and render it as slim as possible; and although the art of making the
description of corsets worn by the ladies of Rome was no doubt at that
time lost, the revived taste for slender figures led to the peculiar form of
corsage known as cottes barditt, which were much stiffened and worn
extremely tight. These took the place of the quaint, oddly-formed
robes we see draping the figures of Childeric's and Pepin's queens, The
" cotter hardits" were, moreover, clasped at the waist by a broad belt, and
seem pretty well to have merited their martial name, Very soon after
this period it is probable that a much more complete description of
corset was invented, although we do not find any marked representation
of
its form until 1043. A manuscript of that date at present in the
