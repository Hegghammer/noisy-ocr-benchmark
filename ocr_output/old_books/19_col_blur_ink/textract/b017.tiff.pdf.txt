CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
3
Every artist does best, that which he is best qualified and best disposed to do. In com-
pleting the number of plates that has been found necessary for the Work, Mr. EDWIN LANDSEER
has chosen to proceed toward the same purpose, upon a different principle. He has grone, without
any introductory medium, directly to the living animals, and has exhibited the savage manners and
habits of these quadrupeds, according to his own idens and observations.
On the distinction between CHARACTER and EXPRESSION, we shall now deliver our opinion.
By the Character of an animal, we those permanencies of his look and features which he
always offers to view when in a placid, or
janed state by bie Expression, the variations
of muscular action superinduced on character,
as the storms of passion sweep
by, and his mind becomes agitated by extery
ardours of his instinet.
The former, seems to hold its court
arts: the latter, agitates, oft-
times rebelliously, the nerves and
er present, both in the animal coun-
tenance, and in the human fag
violent expression does not proscribe, or
obliterate, character. Individ
as far as concerns external appearauce ; and it
forms the system of vowels
of Nature, without which no Expression could be.
Whoever regards
nock of Sheep, will see in them an infinite variety of Character,
with very little Exy
and that little withont diversity : and if we descend a step lower in
the
scale
of
bein
a contemplate the finuy tribe, where Character is not wanting, we find no
Expression Even Trees and inanimate objects, possess Character. We recollect a poetical
friend of ours, now in Italy, saying that every tree and every rock had a free-but of this we are
not 80 certain; though very certain, that there is enough of Character in rocks and trees, to make
a poet think 80.
Character and Expression, in the carnivorous class of animals, to which we here solicit
attention, are always co-existeut - their proportions varying with the existing occasions--
pietorial exhibitions of such subjects.
No. II.
THERE is much Character, and little Expression, in the reposing Leopard with his sheathed
claws, which is shewn in the present engraving, copied by Mr. SPILSBURY from RIDINGEH, and
corrected from Nature. RIDINGER was an artist of great power, who studied wild animals in
their sequestered haunts, as is shewn in his grand forest back-grounds; and who, generally
speaking, left little or no room for others to improve, except on some few of his inferior works.
The present is an interesting and beautiful animal, yet there is a latent capability of mischief
characterised in his countenance, and we might ask, in the language of Job, " Who shall dare to
rouse him up ?"
