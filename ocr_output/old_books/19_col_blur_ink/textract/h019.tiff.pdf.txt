MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE
It will be seen by the engraving that the old house is double. The
western part is that which was built by Barnalas in 1659-60. The
cast or two-story part was built by Jonathan 1., about 1682. The upper
room of this part was used for a court-house for nearly twenty years,
as we learn from Thompson's History of Long Island, and some of
the old benches used when it was a court-house are still preserved.
The old "castle," as Jonathan G. Horton, its last Horton occupant,
used to call invis in all probability the oldest wood house in America.
I know of no elling-house of any kind, stone or brick, now stand-
ing, that can da
as far as this venerable old mansion. There
were a few huts o
east of Long Island previons to 1640-two or
three it is said on
Island. Bot these, as well as those built by
the Puritans, immed
in their settlement in Southold, soon all
passed away. Not a
of any of the first generation buildings
can be found except th
remained for the house that Barnabas
built to survive the WY
and to stand to-day as a noble
representative of the dwn
o hundred and Gitteen years ago.
But the old house stands t
as peering above all others
by its age, but also by its or
not very often that we find
two generations of the same n
ing in the same house=
rarely find three. But here w
in succession, all
bearing the Horton name, livi
me house, and
all born in it except Barnabas I.
We may go
to the castles and palaces of the
search long and dili-
gently, and fail to find a parallel e
With a few repairs, the old castle may yet stand for generations far
in the future.
It requires some thought and reflection to realize the lapse of time
since the old house was built. See the old Puritan himself there
twenty years; then his son Jonathan, twenty-eight years; and then
Jonathan, Jr., about sixty years; and next Lawrence and hir son Jona-
