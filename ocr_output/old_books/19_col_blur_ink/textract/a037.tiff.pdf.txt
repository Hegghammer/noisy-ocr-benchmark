No one doubts that a great forward movement is reaching its culminat-
ing point in the destiny of Asia. The West has learnt its all of religion (the
moral and guiding principle of mankind) from the East, and now the East
would fain learn the law of restraint and the law of freedom (the protecting
principles of mankind) from the West Inspired by this feeling the liberal
Turks decidedly mean well, and they are animated with a sincere desire to
ensure peace and security of life and property for the heterogeneous peoples
under the Turkish sway but they themselves have had to contend and still
have to conten with a A atical populace.
To the Mahommeda
jorld at large the Caliph of Islam is the envoy of
God, the sacredness of on
person must be inviolate. Abdul Hamid, the
astute politician, knew the
security of his sovereignty depended on his
Caliphal rights, and his n
licy during the long period of his execrable
reign had been directed
Is preserving and asserting the same: thus
we can see how his dethre
which the liberal Turks would gladly have
accomplished simultaneou

of a hostile religion, with

hostilities: and when we

to us that horrible and atrocious cruelties have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other religionists, but on fellow Christians of different
denominations, how then can we expect better things from the Turk unless
some power or force restrain him ?
Christianity has now partly emancipated herself from the ferocities
which darkened and poured the red stream of blood on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at large, religion is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite.
