THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE
often very richly ornamented with furs and costly needlework. As
fashion changed, dresses were made with open fronts, so as to be worn
over the surcout without altogether concealing it. A portrait of Marie
d' Anjou, Queen of France, shows this arrangement of costume. The waist
appears very tightly laced, and the body of the surcoat much resembles the
modern bodice, but is made by stiffening and cut to perform the part of
a very strong and efficient corset. Until the termination of the fourteenth
century very little change appears to have been
de either in costume or
the treatment of the figure, but at the con

century, when such noble families as the
and Visconti

Germany a great may strange freaks of fashion appear to have been
practised about this time. The tight, harlequin-like dress was adopted
by the gentlemen, whilst the long trains again stirred the ire of royalty.
We find Albert of Saxony issuing the following laws: No wives or
daughters of knights are to wear dresses exceeding one yard and a-half
