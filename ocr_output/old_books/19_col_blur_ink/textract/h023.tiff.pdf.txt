Jeremiah also settled in Massachusetts There was a John Horton in
New York, in 1645, but no one has been found claiming descent from
him. He probably returned to England.
It is not known from what place in England either Thomas or Jere-
miah came, nor is there any certain evidence that they were brothers
of Barnabos, bet the tluree coming over about the same time would
favor the tradition that they were brothers
The Head Quarters of Coesar's army was near the present
the principal town of that county, and the Horton name has been
known there to the remotest period of any authentic cords This
fact, together with the name itself, favors the idea that

It is held that this Joseph settled in Mousely, Leicester Co., and
