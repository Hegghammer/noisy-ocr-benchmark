THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
I went in and stood on the floor of our house my
heart was thumping within me at the thought of
what was before.

And there was the pot boiling over the fire with
a few green herbs in it. There was Saba, my
mother, stirring the last handful of meal amongst
the green herbs. And there were my brothers,
all older than I, sitting by the fire, waiting for
the herbs and the meal to be ready.

When my mother looked toward us she saw t
man from the strange boat. She thought tha
some crime had been committed by me or my fa
to bring a man of such high degree amon
She and my brothers were greatly afraid,
were poor, and those who were high
to them. But the stranger spoke
“Good fortune has come to yo
to-day.” And when they all t oward him
he said, “I who am very knowledgeable will take
your son with me as an apprentice, and I shall
instruct him in arts and crafts and mysteries.”

My mother said, “The boy is young, sir, and we
thought he would be with us for a time longer.”
