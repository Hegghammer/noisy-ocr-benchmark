THE LUSITANIA’SS LAST VOYAGE

I mean those in the staterooms. I cannot
speak with certainty in regard to the port-
holes on deck E. I believe that the first list
the ship took brought her down to these
open ports on the starboard side and that
she sank much more quickly from filling
through Yhem.

On myketurn to the deck I felt that the
steamer mut make her final plunge any mo-
ment now, Wiad as there was nothing more that
could be dk n the port side —for there was
no disciplir rder with which to do it—lI
passed throw the starboard side. Men
were striving er the boats and were
putting wome om into them, but it
seemed to me ied horror to
the whole situ into a
boat that you cleared
and which w ec steamer;
better leave cto let them
take their wreckage.
