THE ZONE
Avert Thy gaze, O God, close tight Thine cyes!
Glance down no longer on the ocean foam,
Lest Thou behold such horrors as can turn
Men's burning hearts to ice, and chill their souls.
Keep Thine heart warm and full of charity
That Thou mayst yet be able to forgive,
And pity feel for those who know not whe
To pause in deeds of ruthless sacrifice
Restrain Thy wrath, an
check,
Smite not, nor Geroely Us
Those who can dare to strew
With fellow creatures, innocent Â¢
Forget the studied purpose to destroy;
The launching of the missile through the
The shattered bull; the crushed and bleeding
The seething swirl of wreckage, women, men.
