of the Porte have been unreasonably forgotten or neglected. They are fully
as wretched as the Slavs or Cretans have been ; and in so far worse oft
that in Europe there exists no large body of tribes making murder and
robbery its regular and daily occupation as the Kurds, and nny,
Circassians also, have done in Armenia. If anyone will take the trouble to
read the complaints of oppressions and cruclties presented to the Porte by
the Armenian Patriarchate \p 1872 (since reprinted in England) and some ot
the more recent statementsYyrinted by the Armenians in England on the
same topic, he will see that Ustate of Turkish Asia presents as grave and
pressing a problem as that o/ varia itself.”

In the 4th edition of the book. published in 1896, the following
note appears to the passage I ted :

‘Shortly after this was he Blue Books presented to Parlia-
ment, containing reports from | suls in Asiatic Turkey, showed
that things were really far worse han they had been in Bulgaria or

from their frightful grievances the A ns were hunted like wild beasts
and killed like rats and flies during the H¥iidian régime.

You will tell me, my christian friends, UN& with the rise of the reform

reform party first rose in power, and nine months after the inauguration of
the Constitution. I do not question the goodwill of the reform party, but
the reform party does not comprise the whole Turkish nation, and until the
Turk learns to become liberal, civilized and human, there may be no more
Armenians left, unless some Christian Power such as the United States
demands their protection and enforces it. No! my Christian friends, it can
be well for other Christians in the Turkish Empire with their powerful
Governments at their back; but alas! there is no security for a subject
people alien in race and religion.

The massacres in April last raged from Adana to Alexandretta, and
according to authenticated reports about fifty thousand men, women and
chikiren were hideously exterminated ; more than this, the last massacres
were especially characterized by the most hideous, the most loathsome, the
most revolting and ferocious cruelties perpetrated on women and children.
Now what other name can we find for the perpetrators of this diabolical
