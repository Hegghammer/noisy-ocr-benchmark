16 HALFHOURS WITH THE HIGHWAYMEN
entrusted to her keeping by a farmer attending
the market. To convince Ratsey how trusted
a person she was, she foolishly showed where she
had placed the bag; and as soon as her back was
turned he had taken it from the cupboard where
it lay, and made off.

When the farmer retdxned and wanted his
money, there was the very deyee to pay. He and
the landlady went off to the no justice and
swore an information against jel, who was
arrested and thrown into prison, but before he
had found time to return home and bi the bag
in the garden. In confidence he told h ther
where it was hid, his mother told his si
sister told her husband, her husband
friends, and so at last the confession
ears of the justices. Gamaliel would un
have been hanged on that occasion, only he broke
prison and escaped, clad only in his shirt.

His further adventures with Snell and
Shorthose, two companions of like inclination,
are in themselves amusing when reduced to less
stilted language than that of the Life. Ouriously
enough, one of these incidents is concerned with
the robbing of an actor, whom Ratsey bids deliver
his money first, and a scene from J/amlet after-
wards. So it was not from any want of acquaint-
ance with the best models that the unnamed
author of Ratseyâ€™s life failed to put life into
his narrative. The incident is treated in as dead
and wooden a manner as the rest.
