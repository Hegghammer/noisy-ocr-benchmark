story-teller’s place and fresh candles were lighted
and set upon the table.

“Your danger is great,”’ said the King, “and it
will be hard for you to show us that you were
ever in such danger before. Begin your story.
And if it is not a story of a narrow and a close
escape there will be little time left fpr you to
pare for your death by the sword.”

Thereupon the youth in the foreigr#dress
long into the wine cup that was handiid him,
he drank a draught of the wine, a re aa
the King and the lords who sat by t cin d
he said :

“Once I was in greater danger, for th
was close to me, and no hope whatever iven
me of my saving my life. I will tell t tory,
and you shall judge whether my danger was
greater than is my danger now.”

And thereupon the youth in the foreigf dress,
who had tried to steal the white horse tft King
Manus owned, began the story which is Het down
