2 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

the scene of which, by the way, he has not represented as a royal menagerie, but as a wild,
rocky cavern—bhis animals partake of the artificial character of which we cannot bring ourselves to
approve.

Of this fact, however, we purpose to exhibit proof with our assertion. Improved versions, to
the best abilities of our Artists, of some of these Lions of Runens and the Assyrian king, will here
be introduced, which the reader, who pleases, way compare with the originals. Our second, third,
and fourth Pla

The Lions of We do not intend to discuss at length whether the
ideality of allegorical is: we only state the fact: yet the opivions which we
felt at liberty to form on the at liberty to utter. So much in apology for using the
licence of asserting that the hea ny of the Lions of Runens rather resemble those of frowning
old gentlemen decorated with I wigs ; as if Nature's journeymen had made mancs, and not
made them well. There is a ion of flowing and curling hair, which seems rather to solicit
the unguents of the perfumerfMifn to have endured the torrid beats of the desert, or the rough
storms of the forest. The sh@ifof a Lion's mane is a very different sort of thing.

However such dressed Jfins may be thought to accord with Allegory, they are demonstrably
at variance with Nature. ‘> be sure, what might become a Lion in the procession of the Cardinal
Virtues, might be rather unsuitable in bis den, or within the precincts of those wild haunts, where be
is accustomed to roam in his natural state. We have often read of the fabled Men-bulls, or (Mino-
taurs,) and we find such on the coinage of Crete. These allegorical creatures of Runens, which,
alas! have sometimes been quoted by Artists without half his genius, and placed in savage con-
flicts, or beside their Britaunias—are a species of Men-lions. Placed among the Sabean sculp-
tures, they might poss for incarnations of Sol in Leo; but would very ill pass for Leo alone.

Among the observers of this poctic improvement, or this natural and unpoetical deficieucy, on
the port of Runens, Trriax, Jvtsio Romaxo, and other painters, both ancient and modern; and
of the cousequent desideratwm on the part of the public, of a cabinet or library collection of the
nobler wild animals in a state of Nature, so as to answer the purposes of reference, while they con-
duced to the pleasures of Taste, were Mr. Epcan Srirsnury and Mr. Tomas Lanpsren.
Whether or not the public “looked up to them for light” on that subject, (to use the language of
Stennr,) they thought the Public “deserved it ;” and they therefore, as the best practical means
of eliciting that light, first copied the general forms and attitudes of most of the wild animals that
appear in this book, from the old masters—geuerally speaking, from works that are well known
—and then, went to Noture and corrected the details. They carried with them what, in those
ancient masters, was meritorious in composition, attitude and chiaroscuro, and brought away,
to the best of their ability—superadding it to, and blending it with, the above—accuracy of
detail.
