THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER

And that is the way that the story of The Boy
Apprenticed to an Enchanter used to begin.

But first I shall have to tell you about King
Manus and his three horses.

King Manus ruled over the Western Island, and
he had a castle U mer nor wider
than any other Kis sad a stable
that was more stror her King’s
stable. It had dow t had oak
beams; it had an i “ks to it.
And before this dk drawn
swords in their hand ;

In those days, if o y and
asked him for a gift tl to
give what was asked ¢ 1s
was hard to come to by os
before the chamber wh
stood a servant to take t t,2
one that might not be bre him,
excuse for the King

It was all because of the 12's three hor
a white horse, a red ho and a black ho
The white horse was as swiff as the plunging wave
