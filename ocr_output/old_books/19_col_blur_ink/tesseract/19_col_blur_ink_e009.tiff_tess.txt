PREFACE
Tite subject which we have here treated is a sort of figurative

battle-fickd, where fierce contests have for ages been from time to time
waged; and, notwithstanding the determined assaults of the attacking
hosts, the content se remain pretty much as they were at the
| Commencement of th atter remain strictly neutral,
| merely performing the 2” making
| it our duty to gather togx
| and modern, as may prove f the

vicissitudes of war, mark its ne, to do our best
) to lay clearly before our readers the hustorical facts—experiences and

arguments—relating to the much.discussed “ Corset question.”

As most of our readers are aware, the leading journals especially

intended for the perusal of ladies have been for many years the media
) for the exchange of a vast number of letters and papers touching
the use of the Corset. The questions relating to the history of
this apparently indispensable article of ladies’ attire, its construction,
| application, and influence on the figure have become so numerous of late
| that we have thought, by embodying all that we can glean and gamer
| relating to Corsets, their wearers, and the various costumes worn by

ladies at different periods, arranging the subject-matter in its due order
| asto dates, and at the same time availing ourselves of careful illostration
| when needed, that an interesting volume would result.
