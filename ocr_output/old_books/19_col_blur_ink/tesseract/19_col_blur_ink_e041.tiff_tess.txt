Serutt informs us that the Roman women, married as well as
unmarried, used girdics, and besides them they sometimes wore a .
swath or bandage round their breasts, called strophium, whic to
have answered the purpose of the bodice or stays, kle or
bandage on the left shoulder, and that the mitra Greeks

dedicate the same to Venus. So it will be seen that the waist and its |
adornment were considered at that carly period of the world’s history
