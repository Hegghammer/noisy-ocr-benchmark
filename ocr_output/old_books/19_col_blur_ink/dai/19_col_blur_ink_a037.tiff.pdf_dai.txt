No one doubts that a great forward movement is reaching its culminat-
ing point in the destiny of Asia. The West has learnt its all of religion (the
moral and guiding principle of mankind) from the East, and now the East
would fain learn the law of restraint and the law of freedom (the protecting
principles of mankind) from the West. Inspired by this feeling the liberal
Turks decidedly mean well, and they are animated with a sincere desire to
ensure peace and security of life and property for the heterogeneous peoples
under the Turkish swa but they themselves have had to contend and still
have to conten! with a tical populace.
To the Mahommeda orld at large the Caliph of Islam is the envoy of
God, the sacredness of person must be inviolate. Abdul Hamid, the
astute politician, knew the security of his sovereignty depended on his
Caliphal rights, and his na
licy during the long period of his execrable
reign had been directed is preserving and asserting the same; thus
we can see how his dethre which the liberal Turks would gladly have
accomplished simultaneous e inauguration of the Constitution, had
to be deferred to a later
how it was necessary for the She k ul
Islam to pronounce the C
r to his sacred trust, a violator of the
holy law of the Prophet
dethronement could be dared or
accomplished. ?
The Christian Armen
live in the midst of the followers
of a hostile religion, with
ce behind them which makes for
protection. Who does not
eat numerical preponderance of
Hinduism keeps the balance
and restrains bloody religious
hostilities; and when we
religious history of Christian
Europe, and that terribly
mitted in the name of Him
who expounded His re
the Good Samaritan, and
the precept of loving
we cannot feel surprise at
the fanatical outbe
med, the founder of a
religion whose
all short of the humane principles
inculcated by the founder of Christianity. If authentic historical facts prove
to us that horrible and atrocious cruelties have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other religionists, but on fellow Christians of different
denominations, how then can we expect better things from the Turk unless
some power or force restrain him?
Christianity has now partly emancipated herself from the ferocities
which darkened and poured the red stream of blood on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at large, religion is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite.
