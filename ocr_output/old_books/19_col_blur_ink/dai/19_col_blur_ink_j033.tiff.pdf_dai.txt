to rule, and is necessary to keep strands equidistant and parallel.
At times respacing at several places will be necessary. When it is
simply redivide into as nearly the given dimensions as possible.
After the holes have been bored and cleaned the seat is ready
for caning Start at the center hole in the back. Pall the came up
thru this hole and across the
the front. Work both ways on
started in this manner. It is best that the

the work better. The caning operations on the seat to be
are the same as those described in the seven steps in caning
never vary. The only new thing involved here is the shape
seat. Fig. 20 is a photograph of a chair seat of an old shape,
irregular ellipse. It shows the first step half completed. Note here
that the last strand skips two holes, one at the front and one at
the back. This is necessary to keep strands as nearly the same
distance apart as possible. Fig. 21 shows the first step completed
