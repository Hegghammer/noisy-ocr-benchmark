Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
Turkish rule? To this question, we must answer an emphatic No!
The causes that must operate against any change are many and deep-
seated. In the first place it cannot be expected that a few Turks of liberal
ideas (or it may be French polished) at Constantinople, are going to change
the thought and character of the nation. The characteristics of a people
change very slowly, if they ever change at all, and the predominant national
traits of the many-blooded modern Turk have bee hown to the world to
be, cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a fie sensuality; and what is
more than all, and which has to be remembere ost, is, that they are a
people accustomed to the unbridled gratificate their worst passions.
The ethnographic traits of the Turk ich history bears out, are
wildness and fierceness, and it would no orrect to argue that with the
instincts of his primitive ancestors ha assimilated the many cross
currents that run in his veins, in
which has been infused the
doctrines of the religion of the sw
gion which does not make for
the peace or well being of man
gion, also, which assigning one of
the two sexes to the degrade
ing created solely for the gross
pleasure of the other, does
caltation of mankind.
To quote again the emine
reviously referred to: "No
Mahommedan race or dynasty has e
self able to govern well
even subjects of its own religion, while to qual rights to subjects of
a different creed is forbidden by the very law ing.
Not the Jewish conceit proclaiming itself God ct and chosen, and
originating the name "heathen" which it scorned. Noe Christian conceit
emanating from the Jewish source, and laying the flattering unction to its
soul of superiority over the "heathen" of its own time. Not the unbending
caste exclusiveness of the Brahman across whose path even the shadow of
the despised Sudra falling would be deemed defilement. Not any of these,
can equal the intolerant religious pride of the Mahommedan, or reach the
pinnacle of religious self-sufficiency on which he has seated himself. To be
a Mahommedan, is enough-Cela suffit.
To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans, and
intimate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahommedan is above all things a Mahommedan. His
religion is the paramount question in his life, and remains its predominating
feature above everything else. This should not be surprising, since to the
"faithful" Paradise is secured, and all crimes and transgressions against
"unbelievers" absolved.
