CHAPTER II
CANING SUGGESTIONS
As weaving progresses difficulty will be experienced in inserting
cane ends in the holes, due to their becoming filled. Force the
scratch awl thru and turn it several times. This will effectively
force an opening
In many instances long mds of cane remain from one series to
another. These generally, as previously mentioned, should be used
in succeeding steps. There is one limitation. They should be
used provided it is not necessary to carry them over more than four
holes on the under side of the frame. The fewer loose ends left,
the better, for the caning is thereby meater and better. It is gener
ally advisable to use a full length strand to avoid a number of
The amateur will find his greatest difficulty in properly weaving
the diagonals at the edges; that is, immediately upon entering or
leaving a hole. Many commendable pieces of caning are spoiled
by ragged, improperly woven edges. Care must be taken to see
that the cane goes sevr and ander the proper strand or strands at
these points. Fig. 6 clearly shows how the diagonals should run.
Study it carefully.
The addition of a binder is generally a matter of taste. Perhaps
so per one of modern hand caned furniture does not emple
binder of any description. The series of regularly
