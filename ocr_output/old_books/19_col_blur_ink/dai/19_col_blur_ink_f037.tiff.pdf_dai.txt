as the town was named, i.e. the "hill-staple'
or market, and his successors were often there.
The wool market was the most important at
Dunstable; the monks long maintaining great
flocks of sheep on the adjacent downs.
The robbers became only a memory, but a
memory that never faded. It merely took on
another form, and in the course of time the name
of the town itself was twisted in an allusion
to them and to their leader. ded the col-

The legendary Dun a kind of bogey to
the children of the neighbourhood, and in John-
son's pages is a most bloodthirsty creature.
There we read that his first exploit was on the
highway to Bedford, where he met a waggon full
of corn, going to market, drawn by a fine team
of horses. He accosted the waggoner, and in the
midst of conversation stabbed him to the heart
with a dagger. He buried the body, and drove the
waggon off to the town, where he sold the corn
and the waggon as well, and then disappeared!
