THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
I went in and stood on the floor of our house my
heart was thumping within me at the thought of
what was before.
And there was the pot boiling over the fire with
a few green herbs in it. There was Saba, my
mother, stirring the last handful of meal amongst
the green herbs. And there were my brothers,
all older than I, sitting by the fire, waiting for
the herbs and the meal to be ready.
When my mother looked toward us she saw the
man from the strange boat. She thought that
some crime had been committed by me or my fat
to bring a man of such high degree among
She and my brothers were greatly afraid,
were poor, and those who were high v
to them. But the stranger spoke se
"Good fortune has come to you
to-day." And when they all the toward him
he said, “I who am very knowledgeable will take
your son with me as an apprentice, and I shall
instruct him in arts and crafts and mysteries.”
My mother said, “The boy is young, sir, and we
thought he would be with us for a time longer."
