victims in thy Yildiz Kiosk, found its way to thy treacherous heart. No
poisoned cup of coffee like the countless cups brewed in thy palaces trickled
down thy throat to end thy vampire existence.
Thou hast lived! Protected from the Nemesis of thy crimes by the
jealousies and rivalries of great powers which thou artfully played one against
another; by the combined forces of religion and plunder which thou cunningly
wielded into one. Even so thou livest! Peerless living example in the
civilized twentieth century of the Triumph of Crime.
L'AVENIR.
In the foregoing pages I have directed my humble efforts to sketch out
what the Powers of Europe have done in the past, and how their actions
have reflected on my unfortunate race.
It is considered good policy now by
opean writers
to ascribe all the horrors
espot,
to represent him as a tyrant
unconquerable as he was
implacable, in short as a son
ng who swept everything
before him to the consummation of his
tic will. The reason for
this is not difficult to perceive. They wo isavow the part Europe
has played in the tragedy, and to do this su y it becomes necessary
also to present Turkey to the world now as dise (from whence the
tyrant once removed) peopled only by saints gels; so we have also
many roseate colored word pictures of Constitut Turkey.
The murders, deportations and imprisonment of the Turkish revolu-
tionaries, or more correctly reformers, were undoedly the sole work of
Abdul Hamid and his palace clique, but Abdul and minions could not
have carried out that hellish work of wholesale termination of the
Armenians without the perpetration and participation of the Turkish
people. It is true the massacres were originated and organized in the
Palace, the Palace clique stirred up religious fanaticism and race hatred, but
the co-operation of the people was necessary; and the people co-operated
in order to plunder and enrich themselves with the worldly goods that the
Armenians always knew how to acquire by their own industry and toil; the
appeal to their marauding and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover easy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about ten to one and who were practically unarmed.
