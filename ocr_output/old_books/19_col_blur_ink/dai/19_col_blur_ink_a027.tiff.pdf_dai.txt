was a race up to that time among non-Moslem peoples which with sincere and deep feeling
honored the Ottoman fatherland that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman country as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engage in
commerce and agriculture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase the value of
the Ottoman Empire. Because a few among them justly started an agitation, these our noble
and industrions brethren were being massserol. What a terrible scene! When we
left the school building we saw hundreds of the bodies of our Armenian compatrists being
removed in manure carts; legs and arms were hanging down outside. This bloody scene will
ever remain impressed on my mind.
"This shocking crime of Yildiz formed a deep lake of blood, and this lake, during the
whole course of a cursed absolutism, up to the last moment, grew wider. Even during the
past nine months of the Constitution, in spite of the brotherly feelings which had been shown,
the awful events in Adana took place and the souls of all true Osmanlis melted into tears.
Up to the present time the deep sorrow caused by this event has not disappearod, because this
bloody wound in our social body cannot easily be cured. While we fill our stomschs with
choice morsels, while we rest selfishly in our comfortable beds, these fatherless and brotherless
orphans, widows hungry, naked, and barefoot wander hither and this, and thousands of
families are fleeing from the fatherland. We are convinced the government is doing its
work, but what has happened is so great alamity that is keep a government basy for
years. However much" sacrifice we nay
make, si will be inadequate, because the
happiness of the fatherland depends on
wounds as there as soon as possible.
We are convinced that the government
ed with it are persuaded of this as well as
ourselves. We must now wipe out the the misfortune brought by a carsol period.
We must now comfort weeping bear must understand and teach those who do not
understand that patriotism and bro do not differ from each other. The responsibility
of the government for the Armeni ery great and very weighty. The whole Ottoman
nation is under obligations to pry s suffering race, because the liberty we enjoy to-day
is in large part due to the
bed by the Armenians. We thought that those truths
were so obvious that we prefer keep silence, whereas to-day we understand that it is
necessary from time to time all the greatness of our obligation. We must not forget
that this unhappy people yesterday has endured only barbarism, and for twelve years
has been constantly oppre and ground to the earth, and has given thousands of victims.
Hereafter we must worksure them that the era of massacres has passed, and with all our
strength of mind and so we must quiet them. The obligation of the government to protect
them is also very heav because our Armenian countrymen live among wandering tribes,
We must all assist the government and point out its obligation. It must be declared in
pablic and periodically that the one of the most important duties of the Ottoman nation is to
protect, together with those of other races, the interests, the life, and property of the
Armenians as well, since these are their sacrol rights. Let investigations be tasde and let
whatever is necessary be done in order to reach this aim.”
This article of the Turkish officer, who however does not dare disclose
his identity; and the account given by an authority like Mr. James Bryce
surely refute the facile explanation of Ahmed Riza Bey in alluding to the
Massacres as "les Massacres occasionnés par les aventuriers Arméniens."
Indeed it holds out poor hope for the furtherance of liberty and justice in
Turkey when the man who is the President of the Chamber of Deputies only
