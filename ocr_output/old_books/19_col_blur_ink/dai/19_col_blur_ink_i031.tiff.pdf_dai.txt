THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
I mean those in the staterooms. I cannot
speak with certainty in regard to the port-
holes on deck E. I believe that the first list
the ship took brought her down to these
open ports on the starboard side and that
she sank much more quickly from filling
through hem.
On my eturn to the deck I felt that the
steamer met make her final plunge any mo-
ment now, as there was nothing more that
could be don the port side-for there was
no disciplinerder with which to do it-I
passed throu the starboard side. Men
were striving ver the boats and were
putting wome
ren into them, but it
seemed to me
ded horror to
the whole situ
into a
boat that you
cleared
and which w
e steamer;
better leave
to let them
take their
of wreckage.
