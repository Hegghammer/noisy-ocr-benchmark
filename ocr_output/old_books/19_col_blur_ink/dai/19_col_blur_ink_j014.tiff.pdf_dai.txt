SEAT WEAVING
the last space will be a short Â½ in, or whatever dimension is used.
In such cases it is necessary to redivide the last several spaces into
divisions as near % in as possible. It thus becomes obvious why
spacing must be done in one direction as stated. This applies to
all rectangular frames
With a 3/16 in, wood bit bore holes thru the rails and stiles at
the points marked. Countersink the holes slightly on the underside
of the frame. This is not absolutely neces
sary but aids comiderably in locating the
holes, and in other ways. In shops when
power machinery is available a vertical bore
may be used for this purpose. It is best
carefully mark the points for boring with a center punch. The
twist bit will then start accurately and the danger for getting on
of line will be reduced to a minimum. The dimensions given her
are for fine-fine cane. Use sandpaper to remove pencil lines an
rough edges left from boring; then clamp the frame over the el
of a table or bench with a carriage clamp; sit while doing
weaving

Step 1. A bank of cane should be waked for a
warm water, or longer in cold. Do not soak it
strand by drawing one end thru a bole next to hole, and
let it project about 3 in below. Fasten with Then starting
