Van, and the lowest estimate counted the murdered dead at 100,000. Gladstone made the
last great speech of his heroic life, England attempted some kind of protest. But rather
than in the Liberal demand for action, Lond Rosebery left his party for private leisure, and
Rusia, France, and Germany combined to secure immunity for the "great assassin." It
was the lowest point of Europe's shame.
Blow followed blow. Hardly had the remnant of the Armenian people escaped from
massacre when their Church fell under the bratal domination of Russia. Pichve ordained its
destruction, and Golitzin was sent to Tiflis as governor eneral to carry it out. Church
property to the value of C6,000,000 was seized by violence Katholikos resolutely refusing
to give up the keys of the safe where the title deeds were (June, 1903). For two years
the Russian officials played with the revenues, retain ighty per cent, for their own
advantage. But in the mean time assassination had i earth of Plehre, and the over-
whelming defeats of Russia in Manchuria were attribate Armenian curse. Grudgingly
the Church property was restored, in utter chacs, and moment it is Russia's policy to
favor the Armenians as a balance against the Georgia the St. Petersbarg government
is now determined to destroy.

to concole all the frontier district from to Kars, where Armenian villages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Caucasus wins federal
autonomy. But the majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and industries. One cannot yet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolutionary parties of "The Hell" and "The Flag" Of these,
the Social Democratic "Bell" follows the usual impracticable and podantie creed of St. Marx.
The "Flag" or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a great
asembly held in Erivan last August (1906) they adopted a programme of land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected laymen. If the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.
Whatever may be the political fature of the Armenians, they seets likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
