THE ZONE
Avert Thy gaze, O God, close tight Thine eyes!
Glance down no longer on the ocean foam,
Lest Thou behold such horrors as can turn
Men's burning hearts to ice, and chill their souls.
Keep Thine heart warm and full of charity
That Thou mayst yet be able to forgive,
And pity feel for those who know not when
To pause in deeds of ruthless sacrifice
Restrain Thy wrath, and
check;
Smite not, nor fiercely the
Those who can dare to strew
With fellow creatures, innocent on
Forget the studied purpose to destroy;
The launching of the missile through the
The shattered hull; the crushed and bleeding
The seething swirl of wreckage, women, men.
