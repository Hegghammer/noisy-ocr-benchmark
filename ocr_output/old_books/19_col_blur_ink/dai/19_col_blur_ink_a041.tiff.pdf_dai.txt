like a round how, a great brown eye revealed the inward spirit's intelligence and real un-
quenched. On his head was a close-fitting cap of purple velvet.
Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest men-Mgrditch
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or "The Only-Begotten
is Descended." From the window of a neighboring room he might have looked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now all cut close and hariod for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling snow and hurricane that hid the
cone of Ararat. And just beyond Ararat lies Lake Van, last podle of the Deluge the
shore of that lake, eighty-seven years ago, Khrimian was born. In 1890
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land; the Sultan still counted
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byron set

From his earliest years, when he had with

Entering the monastic order after his wife's th, he devoted his
ikling of schools,
which be generously threw open to Kunds, the bereditary assassi
ans. For many
years, while Europe was occupied with Crimcan wars, Austrian
wars, we see hits ceaselessly journeying from Van to Con

cities of Asia, unyielding in the contest, though contionally de

But the cup of Turkish iniquity was filling. The pitik taughter of ations and
Armenians alike was more than even the European Power costand. Withed motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Continople, and Khian found
himself summoned to plead his people's cause before the engress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, be visite all the great courts of Europe
beforehand, urging them to create an autonomous neutr state for Armenia, as they had
done with success for the Lelanon. In London he became acquainted with Gladstone; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and,
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kunds in chock and
enforce Turkey's definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
plodges were observol. Beaconsfield returned to London amid shouts of Peace with Honor,"
and Armenia was left to stew.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake
