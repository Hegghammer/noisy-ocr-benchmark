WHY AND WHEREFORE.
In making a study of my race, I have found three marÄ· racteristics

The Armenians may be led again "as sheep to the slaughter
work of extermination may be completed-Jesus Christ was crucified
Calvary and the servant is not greater than his Lord-but the work of their
extermination can only be completed when the evil influences in the Turkish
Empire have reached their culminating point. Hitherto the Powers of
Europe have by their jealousies and rivalries cultivated these evil influences,
they have watered them and made them grow, but when their culminating
point is reached, they must re-act on Christendom and the natural
consequence must follow. Those who sow the wind, must reap the whirl-
wind. It is in the natural order of things.
I will allow that Liberty, Justice, Equality, Fraternity are the watchwords
of Young Turkey, but Young Turkey is only a small minority; the great
majority of the Turkish nation are not Young Turks.
The question therefore resolves itself into this critical point: "What will
Christendom do even now?"
