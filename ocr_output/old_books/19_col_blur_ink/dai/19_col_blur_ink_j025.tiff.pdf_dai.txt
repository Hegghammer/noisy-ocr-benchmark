In weaving the diagonals it is frequently necessary to run several
in one hole in order to keep the canes as straight as possible. Just

A diagonal should never be permitted to swing to any great degree
out of a straight line. A close observation of the photograph of

boles skipped entirely.
Five-Step Caning-Cane weaving of five steps is not come
It may be done in many cases where it will not be subject to
wear. It is neat in appearance and is much simpler than
step caning. The presumption should not be made that this
will in any way supplant the regular weave, but in instance
