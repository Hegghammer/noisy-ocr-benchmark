SEATS OF REEDS AND SPLINTS
The discussion of the weaving processes to follow is confined,
in the main, to stools or seats. Fig. 53 shows several stools different
in design both in wood construction and in weaving. In two in
stances it will be noted that weaving is done over a separate frame,
one being inserted between the rails, the other fastened on top,
leaving a little projection. Reference is made to several possible
weaving designs and the use of various mediums and combinations

designs of varying complexity may be worked out. An excellent
method for working out posible designs is that of using black and
