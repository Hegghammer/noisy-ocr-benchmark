otherwise the final weaving will prove difficult. The finished seat,
when dry, should ring when struck sharply with the fingers

is not fully understood in this discussion of chair seating
Note that many holes have been skipped in each series, especially
in the last two, and also that more than one diagonal of a given
series enters the same hole. In every case it will enter that hole
which leaves its course in as straight a line as possible. In rect
angular areas it is never necessary to run two diagonals into
same hole, except at the corners. This applies to two diagn
the same series.
