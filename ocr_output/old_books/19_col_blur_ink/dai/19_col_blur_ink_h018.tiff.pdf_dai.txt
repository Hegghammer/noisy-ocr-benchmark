Preface-Introduction
It is said that Barnabas Horton I. was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities
His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It is elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. The original base was of brick, but it had all crumbled down
many years ago. The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G. ton.
The inscription surrounds the be the stone, and reads as
follows:

Hear and obey His public sacred word;
And in your houses call upon His name,

Then God will bless you with your children all,
And to this Messed place He will you call."
Hels, xi : 4.” He being dead, yet speaketh.”
It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the original
thirteen who brought his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and memory
should not perish from the earth.
