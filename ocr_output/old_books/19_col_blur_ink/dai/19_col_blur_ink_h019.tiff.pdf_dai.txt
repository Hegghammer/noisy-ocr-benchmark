and genealogy of the early settlers of Southold-examining all the deeds and wills,
and other authentic documents to be found, and also copying the inscriptions from
every benchtone, not only in Southold, but over nearly the whole Island-makes it
very evident that some of those named were not there at so early a date, and be
also says that Peter Hallock, who is mamed as one of the thirteen, was the grandson
of the Puritan Hallock who settled at Southold, and whose Christian name was
William. Mr. Moore is one of the best genealogists of the country, and in relation
to Long Island, he is the best authority extant,
MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE.
It will be seen by the engraving that the old house is double. The
western part is that which was built by Barnabas in 1659-60. The
east or two-story part was built by Jonathan I., about 1682. The upper
room of this part was used for a court-house for nearly twenty years,
as we learn from Thompson's History of Long Island, and some of
the old benches used when it was a court-house are still preserved.
The old "castle," as Jonathan G. Horton, its last Horton occupant,
used to call it is in all probability the oldest wood house in America.
I know of noelling-house of any kind, stone or brick, now stand-
ing, that can dack as far as this venerable old mansion. There
were a few huts of east of Long Island previous to 1640-two or
three it is said on Island. But these, as well as those built by
the Puritans, imme on their settlement in Southold, soon all
passed away. Not a of any of the first generation buildings
can be found except the

built to survive the w

representative of the dw
hundred and fifteen years ago.

With a few repairs, the old castle may yet stand for generations far
in the future.
It requires some thought and reflection to realize the lapse of time
since the old house was built. See the old Puritan himself there
twenty years; then his son Jonathan, twenty-eight years; and then
Jonathan, Jr., about sixty years; and next Lawrence and his son Jona-
