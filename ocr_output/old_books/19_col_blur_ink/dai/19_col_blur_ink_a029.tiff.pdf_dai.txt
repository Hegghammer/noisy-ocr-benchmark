PART I.
THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN.
Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the still mor amous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nat stands without
its parallel in history.
In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of memorable scene
witnessed in that city on July the thirteenth 1878. inter has depicted
the proud array of representatives of the powerf mments of Europe,
but in the interests of Humanity there should ed to that painting
the wording of Article 61 of the Treaty of B
en in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).
It was a curious irony of Fate,
the taking of "the
terrible stronghold of Kars," universal
be one of the greatest
and most difficult military exploits e
and the crowning success
of the Russian arms in Asiatic T
ve been accomplished by
an Armenian General; that al
a Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest,
diers fought, conquered and
died, yet by these successe
amelioration attained of the
hard fate of their unhappion
h rule, but that fate, hard
before, was made a hu old and
andfold harder.
GENERAL FRINCE LOMIS MELIKOFF.
Commanded the Russian forces in Asiatic Turkey
during the Russo-Turkish war and captured the im-
pregnable fortress of Kars. Appointed Prime Minister
of Russia by Alexander II. The liberal policy which
characterizol the reign of that excellent monarch, and
the Constitution that he was on the eve of granting to
his people were influenced by Melike; but after the
death of Alexander II he was not allowed to continue in
his good work of reforming Russia, being overthrown
from office early in the reign of Alexander III.
