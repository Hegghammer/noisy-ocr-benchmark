SEAT WEAVING
Primitive Methods-Briefly the primitive process of convert
ing the rattan, or raw material, into cane and reeds, or the finished
product, is this: The rattan stems are thoroly dried or seasoned,
and the modules are pared off with a peculiar native knife. Then the
rattan is sorted into sires and selection made as to grade. The sort-
ing is based upon external color and diameter of the rattan. The
rattan is then immersed in water, and the stem is rubbed vigorously
with sand and coconut husks to remove dirt and foreign substances
It is then bleached by means of sulphur fumes, either in the stem or
after the peel and core have been prepared.
The method of preparing the peel and core is this: The peel, or
outer covering, is removed with a heavy knife; it is then stripped to
selected thicknesses and widths by drawing it by hand thru two
knives set at required distances apart. This peel is commercially
called cane. The core is then stripped into as many strands as
necessary, depending upon the diameter of the cores required.
These are rounded by drawing them thru a sheet of tin or iron
perforated with holes of different diameters. The rounded cores
are called reeds
