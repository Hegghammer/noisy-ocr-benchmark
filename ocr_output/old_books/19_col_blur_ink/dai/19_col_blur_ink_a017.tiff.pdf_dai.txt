of blackened ruins, the stark walls of the churches and houses rising up out of the ashes and
charred timbers heaped on every side. What must it mean to the five thousand men and
women and little children who have survivel a painful flight to the scoast and have now
returned to their mountain home, only to find their houses sacked and barnol! There were
nine Christi villages which clustered about Kessab in the valleys below. Several of these
have been
cely destroyed by fire. All have been plandered and the helpless people
driven out of
the feelings of the Kesab people as they climbed on foot the long trail
up the mount
as they canse over the ridge into full view of their charrel and
ruinel dwellin
of wheat, barley and rice had been burned; clothing, cooking
utensils, furnit
one; their goats, cows and males had been stolen; their silk
industries stam
churches reduced to smouldering heaps. The bodies of
their friends a
en killed had not been bariol. And yet the love of
home is so stron
led down there with the determination to clear up
the debris and
cts from "The Sack of Kesab," Stephen Van I.

As these
ress there comes news of famine
at Zeitoon. T
herican Missionary at Marash,
writes to the R
ssionary at Constantinople, that
12,000 souls in
of hunger; they are wandering
about in rags, m
oking and eating it, if they can
get even that. 1
same story comes to us from all
sides. As we for
on the distress will be greatest.
If 50,000 were
hose who have died and are dying
of homelessness andation willed 150,000. It is true; and the
numbers are not exaggated. Last ye the people reaped no harvest, and
this year there are no sowings.
The latest news is that Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the desolation of the massacres, has been plundered in a night attack
by armed Kurds, and the villagers are now reduced to extreme distress. Before
the outbreak the Armenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeatedly appealed
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec-
tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It is
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
