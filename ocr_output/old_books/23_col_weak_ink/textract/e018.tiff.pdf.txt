THE CORSET ANI) THE CRINOLINE.
bellus of the tribe were not slow in discovering that, when arrayed
in all the panoply of forest finery, a belt well drawn in, as shown in the
annexed illustration, served to display the figure to much greater adran-
tage than one carelessly or loosely adjusted. Here, then, we find the
first indication of the use of the corset as an article of becoming attire.
At the very first dawn of civilisation there are distinct evidences of the
use of contrivances for the reduction and formation of the female figure.
Researches among the ruins of Polenqui, one of the mysterious forest cities
of Sonth America, whose history is lost in remote antiquity, have brought
to light most singular evidences of the existence of a now forgotten
racc. Amongst the works of art discovered there is a bas-relief repre-
senting a female figure, which, in addition to a profusion of massive
ornaments, wears a complicated and elaborate waist-bundage, which,
by a system of circular and transverse folding and looping, confines the
waist from just below the ribs to the hips as firmly and compactly as
the most unyielding corset of the present day.
At the period of the discovery af some of the islands of the
Eastern Archipelago, it was found

made sufficiently broad to fit without undue friction, and stiff enough to
prevent folding together in the act of stooping, sitting, or moving
abont, at once became in effect corsets, and suggested to the minds
of the ingenious a system of cutting and fitting so as more perfectly to
adapt them to the figure of the wearer. The modes of fastening, as
we shall SCC, have been various, from the simple sewing together with
the lace to the costly buckle and jewelled loop and stud.
