ation of
Antiach and vieinity were practically wiped out and the Armenian villages
11
the
Alexandretta district destroyed with immense loss of life. Hadjim, Kessab and the
beigh-
bouring villages were burned Tle Armentan juarter in Tarsus was ruined and ill-omenel
Marash stained again with the blood of thousands of Armenians. Zeitoon was desolated.
The
entire population of Kirikon between Aleppo and Alexandretta were massacred to the last
babe. The moh and the soldiers burned what they coald not carry awny, SO that the material
loss has been enorrows. In place of the former abundance and thriving industries there are

homes, and the residue of those who escaped massaere are reduced to homelessness and
starvation.
