TILE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE,
mother of Brutus, was presented with a pair by Julius Caesar, the value
of which was L48,457
Bracelets are also ornaments of high antiquity, as are rings and
brooches of various forms for fastening the dress.
Rich gold chains and jewelled fastenings were in common use during
this period. The annexed illustration represents a Roman lady of
rank about the reig of Heliogabalus. Little alteration appears to have
taken place in the
1 style of costume for some very considerable
period of time, and thi
in ladies concealed beneath their flowing
draperies a kind of cors
tightened very considerably, for a
slight and tapering waist
on as a great beauty in women,
and great attention was p.
of the figure, in spite of
all that has been written at
t and statuesque forms
of the Roman matrons. On
me Roman Empire by the
wild and savage Hunnish tribes,
taste, literature, and civilisa-
tion were swept ruthlessly awa
long, weird night of mental
darkness may be said to have re
throughout the land from the
tenth to the middle of the fifteenth
tury, and we see little or nothing
of Roman elegance or magnificeng
it above other
nations from that period.
