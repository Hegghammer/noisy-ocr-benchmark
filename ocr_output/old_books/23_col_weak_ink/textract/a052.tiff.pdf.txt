THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND CIVILIZED
EUROPE.
"Hear then ye Senates ! hear this truth sublime,
They who allow Oppression share the crime."
A voice was heard in Ramab, lamentation, and bitter weeping Rahel
weeping for ber children refused to be comforted for her childrey ccause

In the twentieth century of the christian era, in the
impeted
