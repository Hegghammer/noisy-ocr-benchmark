often very richly ornamented with furs and costly needlework. As
fashion changed, dresses were made with open fronts, so as to be worn
over the surcoat without altogether concealing it. A portrait of Marie

by the gentlemen, whilst the long trains again stirred the ire of royalty.
We find Albert of Saxony issuing the following laws: :- "No wives or
daughters of knights are to wear dresses exceeding one yard and a-half

During the reign of the Dauphin in France many changes in dress were
