PREFACE.

writing in praise of the moderate use of Corsets take their facts,
experiences, and grounds of argument from the every-day life and
general custom of the present period.
The Crinoline is too closely associated with the Corset and with the
mutable modes affected by ladies, from season to geason, to be omitted
from any volume which treats of Fashion. The sam facts, indeed, may be
stated of both the Crinoline and the Corset. Bot appear to be equally
indispensable to the woman of the present PE d. To make them
serve the purposes of increased cleanliness, comt
and grace, not only
without injury to the health, but with positive
indmitted advantage
to the plysique-these are the problems to be
dived by those whose
business it is to minister to the ever-changi taste and fashion of
D
the day.
