CANING; THE SEVEN STEPS

open squares are thus formed over the area being caned. Unless
the cane is soaked it will prove rather difficult to pair the canes.
Step 5. This step is the weaving of one set of diagonals. Start

CO give the cane a slight curve and work with both hands on the
upper surface. Use an end of cane
long enough tor convenient hand-

thru the length of the frame, pro-

Care must he taken to avoid twist-

easily, and partially under a cane
