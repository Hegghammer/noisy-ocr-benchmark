WHY AND WILEREFORE
In making a study of my race, I hay found three marked characteristics
Intelligence-Energylndustry. with these three characteristics
is an intense Love of Nationality. live in a complex world. In an
independent people these characte ICS and this sentiment are laudable
Virtues. In a subject people they
Crimes.
After I had laid this bitter Tr to heart, I did not have to seek for the
Why and Wherefore of the Arn
n Massacres.
The Armenian Massacres
without their parallel in history. The
buman mind staggers to conte
e the fiendish orgies of which they have
been the victims, and 00 per
escribe their horrors : and this helpless
christian people are to-day
fame deadly peril as they have been since
the famous Treaty of Ber
Ioned them bound hand and foot to the
mercy of their execution
The Armenians 111,
" as sheep to the slaughter' and the
work of extermination
Jesus Christ was crucified on
Calvary and the sery IS not gre.
is Lord-but the work of their
extermination can be completed whe
il influences in the Turkish
Empire have reached their culminating points
Titherto the Powers of
Europe have by their jealousies and rivalries cultivatos these evil influences,
they have watered them and made them grow, but when their culminating
point is reached, they must re-act on Christendom and the natural
consequence must follow. Those who sow the wind, must reap the whirl-
wind. It is in the natural order of things.
1 will allow that Liberty, Justice, Equality, Fraternity are the watchwords
of Young Turkey, but Young Turkey is only a small minority ; the great
majority of the Turkish nation are not Young Turks.
The question therefore resolves itselfinto this critical point: "What will
Christendom do even now?'
