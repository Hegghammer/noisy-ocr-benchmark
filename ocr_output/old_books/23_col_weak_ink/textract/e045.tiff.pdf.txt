perform for them the oflices of the toilet. They held the mirror in
their hand themselves and gave directions, and Martial tells us that, if the

the revenue of a large estate, and that some women would wear at their
ears the price of two or three patrimonies." We read that the earrings
worn by Cleopatra were valued at L161,458, and that Servilia, the
