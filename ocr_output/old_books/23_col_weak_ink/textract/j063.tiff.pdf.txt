A woven article such as a basket or woven top footstool may
dipped, or the color poured over and allowed to drip dry. In sor
instances it is good policy to wipe surplus stain off lightly. The

varnished. Because of its porosity it soils very casily unless sor
finishing agent is used, and a good grade of elastic varnish is TCCO
mended as a finish, especially when the woven article is subject
severe use.
Other Materials.--Reed is not the only good medium adapi
in weaving, either in correlation with wood or when used alo
On the stools illustrated several other materials have been us
as inner hickory bark and Indian splints and fiber. Binding a
rope, and even willow may be utilized with success. Paper

Sufficient to say that this fiber adapts itself admirably to a

is, commercially, supplanting reed.
Inner hickory bark may be obtained of manufacturers of
furniture either directly or indirectly. They may be obtain
hand if hickory trees grow in the locality, thus enhancing t
cational value of weaving. In the spring or early summe
