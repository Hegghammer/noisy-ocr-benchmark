CHAPTER VII
SEATS OF REEDS AND SPLINTS
The discussion of the weaving processes to follow is confined,
in the main, to stools or seats. Fig. 53 shows several stools different
in design both in wood construction and in weaving. In two in-
stances it will be noted that weaving is done over a separate frame.
une being inserted between the rails, the other fastened on top,
leaving a little projection. Reference is made to several possible.
weaving designs and the use of various mediums and combinations.
The possible combinations of materials are merely suggestive of
possible other onnes, and the individual worker will find that many
designs of varying comple ity may be worked out. An excellent
method for working out posst i designs is that of using black and
white paper strips 1/2 in. in widb (I The design will show up very
clearly because of the contrast of
alack and white. Experi-
menting with the weave on the seat

unsatisfactory. The paper strips are an ext

frame opening to the opposite rail, under this rail, across under-.

pletes the process once around. Repeat three times ; then wrap the
strand around the two rails, without running it across the top.
Thus every fourth strand across the top is omitted. It is not
necessary to cut the strand: the wrapping is continuous, Repeat
