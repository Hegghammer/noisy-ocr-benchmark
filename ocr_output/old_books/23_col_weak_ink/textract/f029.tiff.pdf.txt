thought how exquisitely his customer's kindness
and humour blended.
There is nothing neater in all the history of
highwaymen than this ancedote, twinkling brightly
amid the matter-of-fact records of a degenerate
day.
There is plentiful evidence that when Captain
Alexandor Smith in 1719-20 wrote and published
his work upon the highwaymen and other ovil-
doers, he Dased his book upon the many chap-
books and broudsides then in existence. Many
of them may even now be found by those who
do not mind scarouing for them, but whether
they will repay the trouble is quite another
matter. He includes in his gallery even Robin
Hood and Sir John Falst. Y; and, not concerned
to point out their legendar or merely literary
character, gives aun exact (tho h necessarily not
a truthful) biography of each.
Several clitions of Smith ey
others in two volumes. TY
largely, but all are extreri
SO
curious that it is well wor
roduce
one as on the next page.
Captain Alexander
Immense
delight in his villains
cannot fail to per-
ceive, if you read his book, that his only contempt
was for at bungler in the art. Royalist to the
heart's core of him, he expends his most loving
labours upon the freebooters who displayed his
own political bias, and there can be little doubt
