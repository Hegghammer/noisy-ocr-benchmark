On the field the ever victorious army of little Japan undermined Russia's
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
deleated and ever retreating ammy of colossal Russia. At sea the ever
victorious Japanese Fleet succeeded in completely annibilating the Russian
Fleet. It was war such as the world had never yet seen. The secret of
such astounding successes should be investigated, and here I beg leave to
quote from one of a series of articles in which I gave view to my opinions
during the Russo- manese War. "Japan may be likened to the bundle of
aggots in the fable 111 tied together ; one favernt of larger dimensions in
the centre, the sovereig
] whom the whole nation clusters, and all,
ruler and people tied toge
mantine bands of patriotism.
These remarks of mine
observations of actual facts. In
national unity Japan stands as
the world ; she furnishes
an example which the world needs
h a nation so politically
forlorn as ourselves more than any
O
by.
From the astounding success of lay
to the position the
Great Republic of the United States of
S in the world, and
take the lesson to heart of what
contrast their
present position with the position that
ms occupied
when they first landed on American soil not
years ago.
National Unity is our greatest need it is
ch we must
raise up over our national life. National Unity must engr en on the
tablets of our minds and throb in the pulses of our ficarts. There
are
mountains of difficulties before us, and if ever we must reach the goal we
can only do SO by being bound together like the bundle of faggots in the
fable, with no weakening or loosening of the bands. Then perhaps
we
might once more be able to get an independent footing on the historical soil
of our fathers, and perhaps once more rally round our own flag. A Japan-
ese lives for the State, not for himself; we have no State for which to live,
but let US live for our communities whilst we keep the hope in our hearts
that communities grow into States.
We have grit and endurance in an unparalleled degree, but these
characteristics will profit us nothing il we are wanting in unity.
Let us remember that utterance of the Founder of our faith. In our
loyalty and allegiance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents of
a
cataract, but we must remember lis warning utterance :-
'What shall it profit a man." What shall it profit a nation. Unity is
the soul of a nation. Let us keep our soul and not lose it.
