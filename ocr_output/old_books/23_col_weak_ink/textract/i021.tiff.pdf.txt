THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
paredness towards emergency. I was keenly
interested in all that was done aboard ship as
we approached the Irish Coast, and in fact all
through the voyage I kept my cyes unusually
wide open.
At night the shades in the
loon were
closely drawn, and I noticed that L.
steward left a note for the night W
stating just which ports were open Wh
(the steward) went off duty.
Friday noon when the run was posted
was surprised, for I certainly thought that
this was the time to put on speed. The sea
was smooth as a pancake, an ideal chance for
a dash up the coast. When I heard the fog
horn early Friday morning I turned over and
took another snooze, for there was no use in
getting up if it was foggy and disagreeable
weather. The fog did not last long and was
nothing more than a morning mist.
I got up at noon and had time for a stroll
