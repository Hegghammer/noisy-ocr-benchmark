TITE CATHEDRAL OF KICHMUAT%IN,
(Only Begotten D. scended).
Seat of the Supreme Patriarch. The foundation stame was laid by St. Gregory the
Illuminator who built the Church in the third century of the Christian era.
The cathedral of Etchmiatzin is identified with Gregory ; its name
'Etchmiatzin" means in the Armenian language "the only begotten is
descended," and the story attached to it is, that in a vision Christ appeared
to
Gregory descended in light; Gregory built his church on the spot where
the vision had appeared to him, giving it the name of "Etchmiatzin" (only
begotten descended). The cathedral also gives its name to the town
Etchmiatzin, the ecclesiastical metropolis of Armenia.
