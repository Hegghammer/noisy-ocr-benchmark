THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
raised by a small swell of the ocean and I
was impressed by the nearness of the davit
by getting a blow on the back which nearly
knocked me overboard.
Then I admit that I saw the hopeless-
ness of ever clearing the for'ard davit in time
to get the boat away, so I stepped out and
made a try for it by swimming. I spoke to
several and urged them to come; but truly
they were petrified, and only my training
from boyhood up, in the water and under it,
gave me the courage to jump. I swam about
100 feet away from the ship and then turned
around to see if anyone was following to
whom I could lend a hand, and found
who needed encouragement
to see when the fir
mer
came, that I might
eady to
fight against the vort.
n the others.
The Lusitania did no
own anything
like head first: sb mad, r.
settled along
