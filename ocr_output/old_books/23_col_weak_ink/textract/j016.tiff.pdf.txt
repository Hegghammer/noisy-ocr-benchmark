second peg. This operation is repeated until all holes have been
utilized on the two parallel rails, except those on the corners,
Thruout the seven operations it is necessary that the cane be kei
from twisting by drawing the remaining part of the strand ch
thumb and forefinger.
Step 2. The second step is identical with the first, with the dif-
ference that the other two parallel rails are used, and that the
canes run over the first set of paralle)
canes. If the first strand of cane ha

step, the remainder is used to begi
the second step.
Step 3. This step is a repetition of the first two. The canes o
this series run over the first and second series and parallel with th
first. As each strand is used up bind the end by pulling it under
a cane, crossing from one hole to another underneath the frame
and cutting oft about 1/4 in. from the cane. Fig. 5 shows how this
binding is done. The loose end at the starting point is tied in thi
way, and all subsequent ones should be tied as they come, thu
avoiding interference by many pegs, and insuring neat binding.
Step 4. The actual weaving begins with this step. It may b
done entirely by hand, without resort to the needle, but it is slov
work. The needle should be used. Start at a hole next to a corner
on either rail that has been used but unre, working from caned side
toward the open frame. Go over and under the strands necessary
to form the weave, turning the needle from side to side in order to
catch the canes behind the point. When across thread the needle
with the strand and pull thru, being careful to avoid a twist. Pull
the end down thrn the hole, liring the canes. Pull the cane up
thru the next hole; then star he needle from the opposite side of
the frame and repeat the fi
operation, thus pairing another set
of canes. Continue
