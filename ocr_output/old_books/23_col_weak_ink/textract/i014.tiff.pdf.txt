THE ZONE
Avert Thy gaze, O God, close tight Thine eyes!
Glance down no longer on the ocean foam,
Lest Thou behold such horrors as can turn
Men's burning hearts to ice, and chill their souls.
Keep Thine heart warm and full of charity
That Thou mayst yet be able to forgive,
And pity feel for those who know not when
To pause in deeds of ruthless sacrifice.
Restrain Thy wrath, and keep
check;
Smite not, nor fiercely thrust
Those who can dare to stry
With fellow creatures, it
Forget the studied
The launching o,
Theshattered hull; the
The seething swirl of wree
