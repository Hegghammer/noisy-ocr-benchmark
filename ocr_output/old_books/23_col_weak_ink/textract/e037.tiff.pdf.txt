TILE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE,
29
Oriental figure of speech, is said to have been "ravished by the beauty
of her sandals.' Like the belles of Egypt she did not disdain, in setting
off her charms, to have recourse to perfumes and cosmetics, and
previously to setting out she 'anointed herself with precious ointment.'
In another place Jezebel is said to 'paint her eyelids; and Solomon, in
the Proverbs, in describing the deceitful woman, adjures his son not to
be "taken with her cyclids,' evidently alluding to the
of collyrium.
The Jewish beauty owed no slight obligation to
friant tresses,
which were decorated with waving plume
of pearls; and
in allusion to this custom, followed
om time imme-
morial, St. Paul affirms that
'
er hair.' Judith
braided the hair of hort
and the headdress
of Pharaoli's daughiter,

ed by Solomon to
Carmel. No mention is made of Judith's
wabtedly
made of brass, like those described in Exod
MATIII. 8 as "the
looking-glasses of the women which assemb 4 at the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation."
