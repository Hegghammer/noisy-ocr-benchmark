THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE.

Investigation proves to US that the taste for slender waists prevailed
even more in the Eastern nations than in those of Europe, and we find
that other means besides that of compression have been extensively
taken advantage of. Humboldt, in his personal narrative, describes the
women of Java, and informs us that the reddish clay called "ampo" is
eaten by them in order that they may become slim, want of plumpness
being a kind of beanty in that country. Though the use of this
earth is fatal to health, those desirous of profiting by its reducing
qualities persevere in its consumption. Loss of appetite and inability to
partake of more than most minute portions of food are not slow in
bringing the wished-for consummation about. The inhabitants of
Ceylon make a perfect study of the training of the figure to the most
slender proportions. Books on the S pject are on in that country,
and no young lady is considered the erfection ashionable elegance
unless a great number of qualities

possessed; not the
least of these is a waist which can

two hands; and, as we proceed wit
will be seen that this
standard for the perfection of
nt has been almost
world-wide. From the coral-frin
ecked islands of the
Pacific and Indian Ocean we have

of Crim Tartary and the rock-cro

of Circassia, to see the
same tastes prevailing, and even
e pote
laans in force for the
obtainment of a taper form. Ar marks fr us as to the beauty of
the ladies of Circassia would be redless, the claim to that enviable
endowment being too well est dished to cal for confirmation at our
hands, and that no pains are cared in the formation of their figures
will be best seen by a quotation from a recent traveller who writes on
the
"What would" (he says) "our ladies think of this fashion on the part
of the far-famed beauties of Circassia? The women wear a corset made of
"morocco,' and furnished with two plates of wood placed on the chest,
