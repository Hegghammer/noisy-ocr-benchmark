The first and second parts of this little bo

in pamphlet form for circulation in the Unite lates, shortly after the
Adana Massacres of April, 1009. I have now rught it advisable to add

Introduction and Revival of Christianity in Armenia.
The illustrations and the extracts from the periodicals "Harper's
Monthly,' "The Wide World" and the 'Cosmopolitan' have been added
to the and printing.
