British Museum bears on it the strange and anomalous figure represented
in
the annexed illustration. Opinions vary somewhat as to whether
its origin might not have been Italian, but we see no reason for adopting
this view, and consider it as of decidedly home production. It will be

be proved that the tight lacing and compressing of the body was
