4 hours. Remove it from the tub and wash thoroly in running
water. The best way to do this is to lay the reed on an inclined
surface and turn a forceful stream of water upon it. Chloride of
lime has a bad effect upon the hands in that it makes them sore and
tender, so care must be taken to properly rinse the reed. A little
tallow rubbed over the hands will materially offset the tendency to
tenderness, and generally keep them in good condition.
Staining.-Bleached reed takes stain much more readily and
evenly than does the natural or unbleached. It may be stained any
color with prepared stains, but ordinarily these leave the reed
muddy in appearance due primarily to the difficulty in brushing in
or wiping off the stain in the recesses which weaving leaves. Per-
haps the best agent for coloring reed, and at least a very desirable
one, especially after it has been woven, is naptha. The preparation
of the stain and the pro
is as follows: Obtain the
necessary amount and varie
quired colors with a little nap
color test with a reed. Reed au
therefore the shade will prove out pra
with a small quantity of naptha, as whe
amount. Add the required amount of napth
ingthinning too much; otherwise the color proa
in appearance. Five pounds of color to about 3 A
will prove about the right ratio. For instance, to ob
brown mix ] pound of chrome yellow and 5 pounds of b.
with a small amount of naptha. Stir until the colors are
then gradually add 4 gallons or so of naptha, and stir well.
intensity of the brown may be varied by using more or less chrome
vellow.
Coiled hanks of reed may be immersed in the solution, immedi-
withdrawn and hung to drain dry above the receptacle, thus
permitting atcly surplus stain to drain back into it. The stain may be a
