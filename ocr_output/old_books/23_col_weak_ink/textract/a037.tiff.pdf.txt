No one doubts that a great forward movement is reaching its culminat-
ing point in the destiny of Asia. The West has learnt its all of religion (the
moral and guiding principle of mankind) from the East, and now the East
would fain learn the law of restraint and the law of freedom (the protecting
principles of mankind) from the West. Inspired by this feeling the liberal
Turks decidedly mean well, and they are animated with a sincere desire to
ensure peace and security of life and property for the heterogeneous peoples
under the Turkish suay, but they themselves have had to contend and still
have to contend with fanatical populace.
To the Mahomme an world at large the Caliph of Islam is the envor of
God, the sacredness O whose person must be inviolate. Abdul Hamid, the
astute politician, knew Dat the security of his sovercignty depended on his
Caliphal rights, and hi an policy during the long period of his execrable
reign had been dired
owards preserving and asserting the same; thus
we can sec bow his de
ent, which the liberal Turks would gladly have
accomplished simultan
the inauguration of the Constitution, had
to be deferred to a 1.
and how it was necessary for the She k ul
Islam to pronounce th
tor to bis sacred trust, a violator of the
holy law of the Pro
dethronement could be dared or
accomplished.
The Christian A
live in the midst of the followers
of a hostile religion, in
or force behind them which makes for
protection. 11 ho doe
the great nomerical preponderance 01
Hinduism keeps the Dis
CO
in India, and restrains bloody religious
hostilities ; and when
rev
whole religious history of Christian
Europe, and that long
crimes committed in the name of 11im
who expounded 1 lis religion wit
parable of the Good Samaritan, and
the precept of Toving ones neigh
as one's self, we cannot feel surprise at
the fanatical outbursts of the of Mahommed, the founder of a
religion whose doctrines fall short of the homane principles
inculcated by the Founder of Christianity 1f authentic historical facts prove
to us that horrible and atrocious cruclties have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other religionists, but on fellow Christians of different
denominations, how then can we expect better things from the Turk unless
some power or force restrain him ?
Christianity has now partly emancipated herself from the ferocities
which darkened and poured the red stream of bicod on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at large, religion is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite.
