THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER

And that is the way that the story of The Boy
Apprenticed to an Enchanter used to begin.

But first I shall have to tell you about King
Manus and his three horses.

King Manus ruled over the Western Island, and
he had a castle that was neither higher nor wider
than any other Wing’s castle. But he had a stable
that was more strongly built than any other King’s
stable. It had double walls of stone; it had oak
beams; it had an iron door with four Jocks to it.
And before this door two soldiers with drawn
swords in their hands stayed night and day.

In those days, if one went before a King ;
asked him for a gift the King might not re
give what was asked of him. But Ty
was hard to come to by those wil
before the chamber where
stood a servant to tak
one that might neg
exense for the Ning.

Tt was all because of the King’s three horses —
a white horse, a red horse, and a black horse.
The white horse was as swift as the plunging wave
