2 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
the scene of which, by the way, he has not represented as a royal menagerie, but as a wild,
ocky covern—bis anunals p : ortificial character of which we cannot bring ourselves to
xhibit proof with our assertion. Improved versions, to

The Bianized. We do not intend to discuss at length whether the
ideality of hh cuired this: we only state the fact: yet the opinions which we
felt at 4 bject, we feel at liberty to utter. So much im apology for usmg the
licence o heads of many of the Lions of Rusens rather resemble those of frowning
old gentler ‘ith Ramillies wigs ; as if Nature’s journeymen had made manes, and not
made them wi is a profusion of flowing and curling hair, which seems rather to solicit
the unguents o umer, than to have endured the torrid heats of the desert, or the rough
storms of the fore’ ce shag of a Lion’s mane is a very different sort of thing.

However such l Lions may be thought to accord with Aliegory, they are demonstrably
at variance with Natu To be sure, what might become a Lion in the procession of the Cardinal
Virtues, might be rather Mpitable in Iris den, or within the precincts of those wild haunts, where he
is accustomed to roam in hNpatural state. We have often read of the fabled Men-bulls, or (Mino-
taurs,) and we find such on tM coinage of Crete. These allegorical creatures of Rurens, which,
alas! have sometimes been quo¥ed by Artists without half his genius, and placed in savage con-
flicts, or beside their Britaunias—are a species of Men-lions. Placed among the Sabeean sculp-
tures, they might pass for incarnations of Sol in Leo; but would very ill pass for Leo alone.

Among the observers of this poetic improvement, or this natural and unpoetical deficiency, on
the part of Rupes, Trrian, J utio Romano, and other painters, both ancient and modern; and
of the consequent desideratum on the part of the public, of a cabinet or library collection of the
nobler wild animals in a state of Nature, so as to auswer the purposes of reference, while they con-
duced to the pleasures of Taste, were Mr. Epcar Spmsnury and Mr. Tuomas LAnpsEER.
Whether or not the public “looked up to them for light” on that subject, (to use the language of
STERNE,) they thought the Public “deserved it;” and they therefore, as the best practical means
of eliciting that light, first copied the general forms and attitudes of most of the wild animals that
appear im this book, from the old masters—geuerally speaking, from works that are well known
—and then, went to Nature and corrected the details. They carried with them what, in those
ancient masters, was meritorious in composition, attitude and chiaroscuro, and brought away,
to the best of their ability—superadding it to, and blending it with, the above—accuracy of
detail.
