since the time of Gregory, Christianity has been the national relizion
of the Armenians, and they have cluag to their christian faith vhrough un-
remitting persecutions and martyrdoms such as no other christian people
have been called upon to endure.

The cathedral of Ntchmiatain builfoy Grevory still stands to-day; it has

I read the other Ine of the forcign papers published in Japan,
the following piece o : ;

“Aa Armenian inch pronounced by experts to date from the second

Perhaps the excavations in Armenia which Professor Marr is now
conducting might lead to throwing more light en Armenian history.
