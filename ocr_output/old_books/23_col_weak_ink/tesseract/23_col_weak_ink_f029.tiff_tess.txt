CAPTAIN ALEXANDER SMITH tr
mised to steal for you.” The delighted recipient:
thought how exquisitely his customer’s kindness
and humour blended.

There is nothing neater in all the history of
highwaymen than this ancedote, twinkling brightly
amid the matter-of-fact records of a degenerate
day.

There is plentiful evidence that when Captain
Alexander Smith in 1719-20 wrote and published
his work\upon the highwaymen and other evil-
doers, he Daged his book upon the many chap-
books and brOwdsidcs then in existence. Many
of them may eWe now be found by those who
do not mind searing for them, but whether
they will repay theX trouble is quite another
matter. dle meludes i®ghis gallery even Robin
Hood and Sir John FalstQp; and, not concerned
to point out their legendaNQor merely Hterary
character, gives an exact (th 1 necessarily not
a truthful) biography of each.

Several editions of Smith e¢
others in two volumes. 'f
largely, but all are extrer SO
curious that it is well wo ‘oduce
one as on the next page.

Captain Alexander Pe immense
delight in his villains, annot fail to per-
ceive, if you read his book, that his only contempt
was for a bungler in the art. Royalist to the
heart’s core of him, he expends his most loving
labours upon the freebooters who displayed his
own political bias, and there can be little doubt
