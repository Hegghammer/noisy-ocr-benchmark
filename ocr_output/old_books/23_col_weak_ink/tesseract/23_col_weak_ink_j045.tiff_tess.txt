CHAPTER V
Rus SEATING

Rush seating, employing either genuine rush or substitutes, may
be done to good advantage and with excelleat results in manual
training shops. No equipment is needed to maintain such work.
The addition of a woven seat to a chair or stool constructed in the
shops will necessarily employ a new, interesting medium in con-
junction with woodwork; and materially increase the pupils’ know]-
edge of materials and pos@igle combinations. And, as with caning,
the resultant interest in work at hand more than justifies its
introduction in manual tr ops. Ruslht seating employs a very
simple weave. Different empleyed in weaving naturally
require different degrees d the difficulties encountered

complexity of the weave ry readily undertake the
