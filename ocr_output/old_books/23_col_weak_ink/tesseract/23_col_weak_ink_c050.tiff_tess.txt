THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
city and toward the great market place. Throngs
of people would be there, gathered together for
buying or selling, or for talk of the happenings
of the day before. My master would take me to
a shady place, and we would sit there, resting or
refreshing ourselves with draughts of the wine of
the palm.

And Zabulun would tell me that thg we
had spoken with was the most foolis rho
had ever ruled over Babylon. “Grea 1-
ble he seems when he sits upon his thr 1s
palace,” Zabulun would say, “but for a
is foolish, and he delights more to come
market and hear the talk of giganeers th:
in his council chamber.”

Again and agam Zabulun woule
King, and he would say: “Often he ¢
and he sits in the market place and talks
comers, which is against the customs of the K
of Babylon. We will see him come here, and we
will watch him do what is reported of him.”

Seated in the market in a shady place I would
watch the throngs that moved about there. TI
