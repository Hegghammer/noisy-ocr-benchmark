PREFACE, |
_——

Tite subject which we have here treated is a sort of figure
battle-ficld, where fierce contests have for ages been from time €
waged; and, notwithstanding the determined assaults of the ing

| hosts, the contention and its cause remain pretty much as they at the
| commencement of the war. Fe in the matter remain y neutral, |
| merely performing the part of ¢ own corre ? making
it our duty to gather together suc oth ancient
| and modern, ag may prove interestin note of the
vicissitudes of war, mark its various | o do our best
| to lay clearly before our readers the h oxperiences and
arguments—rclating to the much-discussed [stion.?

As most of our readers are aware, the journals especially

mteuded for the perusal of Jadics have been fo ny years the media
| for the exchange of a vast number of Setters WM papers touching
the use of the Corset. The questions relating Yo the history of
| this apparently indispensable article of Jadies’ attire, its construction,
| application, and influence on the figure have become so numerons of late
that we have thought, by embodying all that we can glean and garner
relating to Corscts, their wearers, and the various costumes worn by
| ladies at different periods, arranging the subjcct-matter in its due order
| as to dates, and at the same time availing ourselves of careful illustration |
| when needed, that an intercsting yolume would result.
