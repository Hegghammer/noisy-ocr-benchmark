THE ARMIENTIAN MASSACRES ANT) VILE
TREATY OO BERTIN,

Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of nrope at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, andgthe signing of the still more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of th fortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel tn history.

In the Guildhall at B anes a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on J irteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of repre fthe powerful Governments of Europe,
but inthe taterests of ere should be attached to that painting
the wordiny of Article pty of Berlin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).

Te was a curious , that although the taking of “the
terrible stronghold of Nz Hy admitted to be one of the vreatest
aud most difficult milttary r achieved, and the crowning success
of the Russian arms ia Ast Should have been accomplished by
an Armeman General; tha Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest, a renian soldiers foucht, conquered and
died, yet by these successes u ly was no amcloration attained of the
hard fate of their unhappy nati ander Turkish rule, but that fate, hard
before, was made a huudredfold aW even a taousandfold harder.
