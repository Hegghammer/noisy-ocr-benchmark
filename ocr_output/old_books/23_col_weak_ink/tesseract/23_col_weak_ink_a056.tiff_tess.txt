Vhus it became the fate of the unfortunate Armenians to be the bruised

and manled shuttle cock of powerful bats.
Much has been written and much has been said by creat authorities,
(far more comprehensively and by pens much more forcible than my humble
"efforts could aspire to reach) against the selfishness and callousness, the
inhumanity and cynicism of those great powers which have coldly looked on
and permitted the hellish atrocities and horrors of the Armenian Massacres.
The name of William Iowart Gladstone ts loved and revered by Armenians
all over the world; but theythunderines of that veteran statesman and the
denouncing protests of thd& thoughtful men whose feelings of revolted
humanity have made themsis heard in sounding language, have fallen on
stony ground; they have be Bithe voices of men crying out in the wilder-
ness. Europe has turned 4 ar io the condemnations of justice and
truth, even as she has tar yi ear to the voice of Rahel weeping for

her slaughtered children.
