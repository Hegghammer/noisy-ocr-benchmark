4 hours. Remove it from the tub and wash thoroly in running
water, The best way to do this is to lay the reed on an inclined
surface and turn a forceful stream of water upon it. Chloride of
lime has a bad effect upon the hands in that i: makes them sore and
tender, so care must be taken to properly rinse the reed. A little
tallow rubbed over the hands will materially offsee the tendency to
tenderness, and generally keep them in good condition.

Staining.—Bleached reed takes stain much more readily and
evenly than does the natural or unbleached. It may be stained any
color with prepared stains, but ordinarily these leave the reed
muddy in appearance due primarily to the difficulty in brushing in
or wiping off the stain tn the recesses which weaving Jeaves. Per-
haps the best agent for coloring reed, and at least a very desirable
one, especially after ityags keen woven, is naptha. The preparation
of the stain and the pr tee follows: Obtain the
necessary amount and vari
quired colors with a littl: ng
color test with a reed. Reed a’

intensity of the browa may be varied by using more or less chro:

Coiled hanks of reed may be immersed in the solution, immedi-
ately withdrawn and hung to drain dry above the receptacle, thus
permitting surplus stain to drain back inte it. The stain may be
used repeatedly, and as it is very volatile it should be kepr in a
tightly corked red can when not in use. It is also highly inflam-
