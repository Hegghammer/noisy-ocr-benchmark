SEATS OF REEDS AND SPLINTS

weaving designs and the use of various mediums and combinations.
The possible combinations of materials are merely suggestive of

method for warking out poss designs is that of using black and
white paper strips 14 ino in wid Phe design will show up very
clearly because of the contrast of ack and whire. Experi-
