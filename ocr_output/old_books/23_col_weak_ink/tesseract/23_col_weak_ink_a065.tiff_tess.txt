Added to these important factors of racial charactenstcs, tnfluences of
religion, and long crown habits of the Vurk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this sjper-added evil, is, the

Armenian peasant under Turkish rule‘even a modicum of that comfort,
happiness, and security of life and property, which the law of all civilized
countrics wuarantees to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil,
