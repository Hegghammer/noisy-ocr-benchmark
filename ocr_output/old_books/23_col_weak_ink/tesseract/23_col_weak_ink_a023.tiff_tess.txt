orgy, except to call them frends incarnate; and who is the bold man who
can guarantee that these same fiends incarnate have become metamorphosed
and changed all of a sudden; or that the handful of liberal ‘Purks at Con-
stantinople are capable of controlling and restraining them, We have not
even heard that the leaders and participators of the last massacrcs have
been punished as they deserved ; and whatis the reason they are left un-
punished ? because the Government is afraxl to punish Mahonmnedans for
killine Chrisuans; because the liberal Turks dare not punish the “ true
believers ‘’ for killing “ Naftirs.”

The relivion of Mahommed, the religion of Ye sword, has been infesed
into the Turk, and to understand the effect offthe religion of Mahommed
upon the Turk, itis necessary to regard it frgfn four aspects, or from four
points of analysis. Tivst, the fundamental dogirme anc law of the religion,
Second, the character of the founder as an efample to his follawers, “Third,
the racial and ethnographic characteristics Pf the Turk. Pourth, the effect
which this particular religion would be likeg te have on this particular race.
When we have viewed the Turk and his JZoverament from these four points
of anatysis, we have the explanation of the woe and desolation which
have Jain over the countries under Tu le,

have made a great slaughter of thei Napter of the Woran which the
Turk has religiously and steadfasy P his creed.

In conclusion, | will ask my rors to compare one point of dilterence
between the two races, the oppg#or and the oppressed. Thousands upon
thousands of Armenian womé#, thousands upon thousands of Armentan
children, have been hounded to death, or savagely, feroctousiy, horribly and
loathsomely maltreated by the Turk, and yer in all the agonizing years when
Massacre has succeeded upon Massacre, has there been one known case or
one stagle instance of a Turkish weman or child maltreated by Armenians ?

Vhe last massacres thouch especially organized from the Palace at
Constantinople, were officially announced to originate from an affray
between one Armenian and three Vurks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed ene of the threc:
given equal numbers and arms, the Armenian is always a match tor the
Turk, but alas for him that unequal numbers and want of arms have always
made him the victim of his oppressor.

Almed Riza Bey in the first part (Ses Causes) of his book “ La Crise de
L’Orient’’ published in Paris in 1907 holds a brief for his natton which
through tts own fallacious arguments falls to the ground. Twul quote one
passage as an example. /
