Again, amongst savages, we should expect to
find in the name of a place an indication of a
natural object, the name being expressive of the
object, and hence as lasting. But, that the

tribal name, as a designation that should sur-
vive not only the encampment, but the very
existence of the tribe, 1s incredible. An exty

sand, is the fortified little seaport of Peniscola.
