In simple narrative the author carries the reader through appNling
scenes of horror, and as we read we are made to realize the slaughter of
the enemy’s machine guns, of their ground-mincs, clectric-wire entanyle-
ments, and cxploding shells; we are made to hear the roar of the artillery
tire dealing deatn and destruction, and there rises before us the mental vision
of the fierce hand to hand couitlict, and the dead and dying Jying thickly in
the dark ravine,

Por hill and bate plain,
With dyine men and slain,
Grew mountain heights of pain,
And mine is boundless woe.”

Vhe grim warrior who stormed and took the most impreynable fortress
in the world gives expression to his feclings on his own great achievement,
in saddest words.

“And mince is boundless woe,”

Vor the erin warrior’s heart is elett in twain for the human builets that

under his command hurled themselves to dicir death.
