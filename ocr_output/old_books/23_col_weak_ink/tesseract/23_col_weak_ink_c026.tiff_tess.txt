THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
T went in and stood on the floor of our house my
heart was thumping within me at the thought of
what was before.

And there was the pot boiling over the fire with
a few green herbs in it. There was Saba, my
mother, stirring the last handful of meal amongst
the green herbs. And there were my brothers,
al older than I, sitting by the fire, waiting for
the herbs and the meal to be ready.

When my mother looked towurd us she saw the
man from the strange boat. She thought that
some cri ad been committed by me or my father
to bring aT sorce amongst us.
She and my bro , for they
were poor, and thos® were harsh
to them. But the stran¥ saying,
“Good fortune has come t sea
to-day.” And when they all tur
he said, “I who am very knowledgea
your son with me as an apprentice, anc
instruet him in arts and crafts and mysteries.

My mother said, “The boy is young, sir, and we
thought he would be with us for a time longer.”
