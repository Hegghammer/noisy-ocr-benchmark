28 THE CHILD OF THE MOAT

They were almost too excited to sleep and Aline, as
her eustom was, when she lay awake, amused herself
by building castles in the air. Sometimes she would
imagine herself as a great lady, sought after by all the
noble knights of the land, but holding herself aloof with
reserved dignity until one, by some deed of unusual
distinction, should win her favour. As a rule, however,
this seemed rather a dull part to play, though there was
something naturally queenly in her nature, and she
would therefore prefer something more active, She
would take the old Seots romance of Burd Helen, or
Burd Aline, as her own inspiration, and follow her
knight in the disguise of a page over mountain and
torrent and through every hardship. This better suited
the romantic self-sacrifice of her usual moods and, by
its imaginary deeds of heroism, ginistered just as much
to her sense of exaltation. T ht had opened vistas
of new suggestion; and she pi her knight and her-
self fleeing before a host o es and miraculously
disappearing at the critical into the segfet room.
But at last she fell into mber phd did not
wake till it was nearly ornyag meal.
