The efforts of the Armenians, and the cntreaties of their Patriareh
Nerses had procured the insertion of Article 16 in the ‘Treaty of San
Stefano signed between Russia and ‘Vurkey in March 1878. In fact the
wording of the Article had been suggested by the Patriarch himself Te
provided the following stipulation for the protection of the Armenians :-—

‘As the evacuation by the Russian troops of the territory which they
