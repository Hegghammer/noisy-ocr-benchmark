THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE, Ss
Fairies, and attendant ladies are described. OF two of the latter it
1s Said—
«Their kirtles were of rede cendel,*
| J Jaced smalle, jolly#, and well;
| Phere might none gayer go.”

The word mensk of y or much. Some
diferences of opinion have exis Sas to the origin of the
word corset. Some are of opinion 1¢ French words corps, the
body, and serrer (to tightly ime] r incase), led to the adoption of

written cers, and may bg#aken as a diminutive form of it. Another
view of the matter lyf been that the name of a rich material called
corse, Which was afWone time extensively used in the manufacture of
| corsets, may have? been thus corrupted. This is scarcely prcbable, as
| the word corset was in use at too early a period to admit of that omgin.
| Perhaps as carly an instance of the use of the term corset as any im
| existence may be found as a portion of an entry in the houschold register
| of Eleanor, Countess of Leicester, which bears the date May 24, 1265 :—-
