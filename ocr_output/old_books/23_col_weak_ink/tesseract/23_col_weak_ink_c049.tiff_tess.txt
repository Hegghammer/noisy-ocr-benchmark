THE STORY OF EEAN THE FISHERMAN'’S SON
when we were far outside the palace my master
said to me:

“Tt will come about that the King will search
for the treasure that I have put into his dreams.
Moreover, he will speak to others of this treasure,
and they, too, will search for it. It will come
about that these many searchers, digging for
the treasure, will break upon the foundations of
the Tower of Babylon. Thereupon I will take the
Magic Mirror and make mysclf the master of the
Babylonians.”

This he said to me as I went with him from the
King’s palace along the Way of the Lions. I we
affrighted, and it seemed to me that the lions
were in stone looked ragefully down on us
passed.
