PRED AND SPLINT WEAVING 59

tion of air. Hf colors have been mixed properly and thinned to the
right consistency, the reed will dry rapidly und the color will be
sharp and clear, free from muddy effects.

A woven article such as a basket or woven top footstool may be
dipped, or the calor poured over and allowed to drip dry. In some
instances it is goad policy to wipe surplus stain off lightly. “Then,
in the case of the footstool or similar project, if the worker sa
desires he may stain the wood a darker shade than the top with a
prepared stain. Reed is very effective without stain; many of the
stools shown herewith are left natural. Reed may be shellacked or
varnished. Because of its porosity it soils very casily unless som
finishing agent is used, and a good grade of elastic varnish is recor
mended as a finish, especially when the woven article is subject
severe use,

Other Materials,~—Reed is not the only good medium adap

Sufficient to say that this fiber adapts itself admirably to z
all work where reed ts commonly employed, and in many ins
is, commercially, supplanting reed.

Taner hickory bark may be obtained of manufacturers o'
