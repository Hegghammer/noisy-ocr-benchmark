CANING SUGGESTIONS 47
holes are bored and ‘utilized in rhe cane weaving, These are not
absolutely necessary; in fact caned areas on many pieces of period
and modern furniture do not utilize corner holes. In such instances
two diagonal strands are run in each hole on either side of the
corner. A comparison of the areas, the one employing a corner
hole, and the other not, will lead the observer to conclude that the
former appears complete while the latter appears unfinished.

Te is frequently necessary or desirable
to cover up che vane on the back or inside ae
of an aracle. This is true of places ex- LE
posed to view, and is especially advisable ie Zou
on such pieces of furniture as the wing- I

in which a groove [4 in. deep and 34 in. wide has been run. “This
groove may be made with saw, chisel, or combination plane. Fig. 8
shows a sketch of such a strip. It makes a neat, pleasing cover.
Many pieces of so-called expensive furniture have ragged, exposed
caning. This is unsightly and is not to be commended.

Wherever it is found desirable to leave cane natural, it is neces-
sary that the frame be stained before caning is begun. Box fuming
will not permanently color cane. On! stains make no appreciable
impression if rubbed off at once. But water, acid, and alcohol
stains produce decided colors. Ef the worker desires to color the
cane approximately the same shade as the article, rhe caning may
be done on the white wood and the entire article stained at the one
operation, Cane may be shellacked or varnished or Jefe natural, |
as desired.

Irregular Areas.—Fiz. 9 shows a close view of the back of the

shaped area for caning, The principles of weaving remain the
