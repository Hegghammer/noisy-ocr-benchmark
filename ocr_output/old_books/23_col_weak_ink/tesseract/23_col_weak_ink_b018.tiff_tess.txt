4 . CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
No. III.
Two CoucHant Lions, arrER RuBeEns, taken from his celebrated picture before alluded
. to, of the Prophet Daniel incarcerated in the den. The Lions are here supposed to be miraculously
held in a state of tranquillity. Here, too, is not much Expression, but an extraordinary grandeur
of Character, suited to the greatness of an occasion where the Deity himself especially interferes
to seal up the voracious energies of the most terrible of his creatures, in calm submission. There
is a character of royal dignity mingled with this submission, which is very impressive, and even
sublime.

The writer estcems this to be a successful restoration of the Nature that was wanting in the
prints of tINgsubject, (which has often been engraved by Picarr and others,) after Rubens. The
original pict¥it bas been our ill-fortune never to have seen. ‘The shaggy manes, and the latent
terror that si nily enthroned in the open eyes of the superior Lion—suited to the darkness of
the de ce of this animal’s sense of vision,—are as well thought of, as they are

vith much address from the closed eyes of the couching Lion beyond,
is most happily marked. A powerful and divine spell possesses
them both.
No. LY.

Tne TIGER WHICH MARCHES IN OUR PROCESSION, without an object before him to call
forth emotion, possesses a calm character, combined with the resistless strength of that dreadful
quadruped ; whose very tranquillity, in his leisure sauntering, when no excitement is acting on his
nerves, las an appalling effect.— His brow is clouded, though his claws are sheathed. ‘There is a
possibility of a dreadful storm which may uot be far distant, and that is enough to stamp the
Tiger’s character. None shall dare to arouse his energies, nor to encounter them when aroused.

No. V. :

Tius GROUP OF PLAYFUL LEoParDs, arvER RvuBENS, must be supposed to belong to the
Jocund train of Bacchus, since they are luxuriating at their case, among grapes and vine branches.
These Leopards are doubtless intended to have a degree of playful expression—induced perhaps by
the exhilarating juice of the grape: and we should “ guess” (as Jonathan says) that this group

was studied from a litter of half-grown kittens. Few, however, except the sailors who were
accustomed to gambol with the Tiger-cub on board the Pitt East-Indiaman, would like to venture
to frolic nith them.
