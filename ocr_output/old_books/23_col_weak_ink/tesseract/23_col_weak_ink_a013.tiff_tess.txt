WHY AND WHIITIERERORE.

In making a study of my race, [hayf: found three marked characteristics
Intellheence—lTnergy—Industry. Confined with these three characteristics
is an intense Love of Nationality. “e live in a complex world. In an
independent people these characteflilMfics and this sentiment are laudable
Virtues. Ina subject people they Crimes.

After Thad Jaid this bitter L to heart, I did not have to scek for the
Why and Wherefore of the An 1 Massacres.

The Armenian \lassacres without their parallel in history. The
iiuman mind stageers to conty >the fiendish orgies of which they have
been the victims, and no pet sserihe their horrors: and this helpless
christian people are to-day, ame deadly peril as they have been since
the famous ‘Treaty of Bey ened them bound hand and foot to the
mercy of their execution

The Armenians m Sas sheep to the slaughter ” and the
work of extermination p s—fesus Christ was crucfied on
Calvary and the ser 1s not ores is Tord—but the work of their
extermination can gy be completed wht slintuences in the Turkish
lnapire have reathed their culminating pon litherto the Powers of
L’urope have by their jealousies and rivalries cultivat& these cvil influences,
they have watered them and made them vrow, but when their culminating
point is reached, they must re-act on Christendom and the natural
consequence must follow. Vhose who sow the wind, must reap the whirl-
wind. Tris in the natural order of things.

Lwill allow that Liberty, Justice, Equality, Mraternity are the watchwords
of Young Turkey, but Young Turkey is only a small minority; the creat
majority of the Turkish nation are not Young Turks.

The question therefore resolves itself into this critcal point: “What will
Christendom do even now?”
