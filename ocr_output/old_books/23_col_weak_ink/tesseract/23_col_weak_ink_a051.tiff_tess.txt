On the field the ever victorious army of little Japan undermined Russia's
stronchold, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
defeated and ever retreatine army of colossal Russia. At sea the ever
victorious Japanese leet succeeded tn completely annilulating the Russian
Vleet. It was war such as the world had never yet seen. The secret of
such astounding successes should be investigated, and here I bee leave to
quote from one of a series of articles in which | gave view to my opinions
during the Kusso-fwganese War.“ fapan may be likened to the bundle of
facvots in the fable ied together ; one fayeot of larger dimensions tn
the centre, the sovererd Soawwhom the whole nation clusters, and all,
ruler and people tied toge yantine bands of patriotism.”

‘These remarks of mine servations of actual facts. In
national unity Japan stands as he world; she furnishes
an example which the werld need: ha nation so politically
forlorn as ourselves mere than any >".

From the astounding success of fa to the position the
Great Republic of the United States of J ss in the world, and
take the lesson to heart of what Unior we contrast their
present posigon with the position that the Hmis occupted
when they first landed on American soil not years aco.

National Unity ts our greatest need; it is rT ch we must
raise up over our national life. National Unity must ener@men on the
tablets of our minds and throb in the pulses of eur Rearts. Where are
mountains af dithculties before us, and if ever we must reach te goal we
can only do so by bemg bound together like the bundle of faggots in the
fable, with no weakening or loosening of the bands. Then perhaps we
might once more be able to get an independent footing on the historical soil
of our fathers, and perhaps once more rally round our own flag. A Japan-
ese hves for the State, not for himself; we have no State for which to live,
but let us lve for our communities whilst we keep the hope in our hearts
that communities crow into States.

We have crit and endurance in an unparallcled degree, but these
characteristics will profit us nothing if we are wanting in unity.

Let us remember that utterance of the Founder of our faith, In our
loyalty and alleciance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents of a
cataract, but we must remember Ilis warning utterance :-—

“AWhat shall it profit a man.” What shall it profit a nation. Unity is
the soul of a nation. Let us keep our seul and not lose it.
