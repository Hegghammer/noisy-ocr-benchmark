CARNIVOROUS DS.
DESC LATES.

Tuar there has hitherto existed eravines of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the progress of the student in t Art, is to be regretted. The talents
of Mr. Jonny Scorr, brought into action IN, Cooper, and the REINAGLEs,
have presented the public with excellent repr the distinguished ornaments of the
turf: the sports of the field, and the habits an f the canine race, were also duly
honoured: but of the ferocious TiGEeR tribe, and t LION, we have nothing extant that
would bear critical inspection, beyond a few detach :—nothing like a collection of
figures, whose justness and accuracy of form, action, acter, and expression, might be
relied on,

Does any reader imagine that the various Etchings with have been performed—chiefly
abroad—by Artists of no mean ability, may be considered as exceptions? They are not exceptions:
or at best, the number which might be so regarded is but small, and those, for the most part, of
dimensions not accommodated to the drawer of the cabinet, or the shelf of the library.

But they are not objectionable on this ground alone. Speaking of them in the ageregate, the
heavier charge lies against them of being insufficient to those purposes of taste and information
which are the ends of Art. Even those after Trrran and after RUBENS (the latter of whom has
perhaps painted a greater number than any other of the old masters) are far more deficient in
form, character, and expression, than is generally supposed, or than will be easily believed, by
those who have not actually compared them with the Lions, Leopards, and ‘Tigers of Nature.
They have been taken too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
—Nor is this intended to impugn the merits, as historical or poctical painters, of those distinguished
Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth. It 1s possible, that as a painter of allegory, RuBENs
might consider that strong infusion of Auman form, character, and expression, by which his Lions,
for example, are distinguished, as necessary, or conducive, to his allegorical purposes; or, it is pos-
sible that his knowledge of this animal may not haye been thoroughly well-grounded, and that he
may have laboured under early prejudice of mind, or of vision, in this part of his education as a
Painter, and may not have seen Lions as they really are. This is what the writer is most inclined
to believe, (though not to insist); for even in treating the subject of Daniel in the den of Lions—
