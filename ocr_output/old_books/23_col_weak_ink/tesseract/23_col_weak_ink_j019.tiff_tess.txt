CHAPTER II
CANING SUGGESTIONS

As weaving progresses difficulty will be experienced in inserting
cane ends in the holes, due to their becoming filled. Force the
seratch awl thra and turn it several times. “This will effectively
force an opening. :

In many instances long ends of cane remain from one series to
another. These generally, as previously mentioned, should be used
in succeeding steps. Yhere is one limitation. They should be
used provided it is not necessary to carry them over more than fo:
holes on the under side of the frame. The fewer loose end J
the better, for the caning is thereby neater and better. +
ally advisable te use a full length strand to avoig af
loose ends. :

Vhe amateur will find his greatest difficu ;
the diagonals at the edges; that is, ir
leaving a hole. Many commendag
by ragged, improperly woveng
that the cane goes over az
these points. Fig. 6 g
