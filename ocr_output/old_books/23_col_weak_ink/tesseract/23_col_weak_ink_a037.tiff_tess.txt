No one doubts that a creat forward movement ts reaching its culminat-
Ing point inthe destiny of Asia. “The West has learnt its allot relicion (the
moral and euiding principle of mankind) from the East, and now the Jast
would fain learn the law of restraint and the law of treedom (the protecting
principles of mankind) fromthe West. Inspired by this feeling the liberal
Turks decidedly meap well, and they are animated with a sincere desire to
ensure peace and secgrity of life and property tor the hcteroveneous peoples
under the Turkish s¥fay, but they themselves have had to contend and still
have to contend with Bp tanaucal populace.

‘Yo the Mahonundffan world at large the Caliph of Islam is the envoy otf
God, the sacredness offvhose person must be inviolate. Abdul Hamid, the

the precept of loving one’s neighW® as one's self, we cannot feel surprise at
the fanatical outbursts of the f] \ wers of Mahommed, the founder of a
religion whose doctrines certaiMf fall short of the humane principles

®nculcatcd by the Founder of Chriftianity. If authentic historical facts prove
to us that horrible and atrocious crucitics have been perpetrated by Christian
nations, not only on other rclivionists, but on fellow Christians of different
denominations, how then can we expect better thines from the Turk unless
some power or force restrain him °?

Christianity has now partly cmancipated herself from the ferocities
which darkened and poured the red stream of bleod on her white banner :
but to the Mahommedan world at larce, religion is still the powder magazine
which a spark can ignite. :
