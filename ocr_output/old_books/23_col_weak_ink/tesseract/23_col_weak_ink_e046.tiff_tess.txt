38 THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE,
mother of Brutus, was presented with a pair by Julius Cesar, the value |
of which was £48,457, |
| Bracclets are also ornaments of high antiquity, as are rings and
brooches of various forms for fastening the dress.
| Rich gold chains and jewelled fastenings were in common use during
| this period. The annexed illustration represents a Roman lady of |
rank about the reigygof Heliogabalus. Little alteration appears to have
taken place in the Q 4] style of castume for some very considerable |
period of time, and tl gon ladies concealed beneath their flowing |
draperies a kind of cors vy tichtened very considerably, for a |
| slight and tapering waist nasa great beauty in women,
| and great attention was p ben of the figure, in spite of |
| all that has been written a 1 and statuesque forms
of the Roman matrons. On 1¢ Roman Empire by the
| wild and savage Hunnish tribest aste, literature, and civilisa- |
' tion were swept ruthlessly awa long, weird night of mental |
| darkness may be said to have rd throughout the land from the |
| tenth to the middle of the fiftcenth¥Muury, and we see little or nothing
: of Roman elegance or magnificeng meeish it above other
| nations from that period.
