Can the Armenians hope now for any change tin their condition under
‘Turkish rule? To this question, we must answer an emphatic No!

Vhe causes that must operate against any change are many and deep-
seated. In the first place it cannot be expected that a few Turks of liberal
ideas (or it may be Prench polished) at Constantinople, are going to change
the thonght and character of the nation. The characteristics of a people
change very slowly, # they ever chanve at all, and the predominant national
traits of the many-blooded modern Turk have been shown to the world to
be, cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a fierce sensuality ; and what ts
more than all, and which has to be remembered most, is, that they are a
people accustomed to the unbridled gratification of thetr worst passions.

Phe ethnographic traits of the “Turkiman which history bears out, are
wildness and fierceness, and it would not be incerreet to argue that with the
instincts of lis prinutive ancestors have been assimilated the many cross
currents that run in his veins, into all of which has been infused the
doctrines of the religion of the sword, a religion which Cocs not make for
the peace or well bene of mankind; a religion, also, which asstrning one of
the two sexes to the degraded position of being created solely for the cross
pleasure of the other, does not make for the exaltation of inankind.

To cnote again the eminent authority previously referred to: “No
Mahominedan race or dynasty mechown itscly able to covern weil
even subjects of its own rely meccual richts to subjects of
a difterent creed is forbid _—o. ——

Not the Jewis] mM. proclaimine itself God's elect and chosen, and
originating the rveathen " which it scorned. Not the Christian conceit
emanating fr fewish source, and Jaying the flateering unction to its
soul of supe Rover the ‘heathen 7 atits own time. Not the mnbending
caste exch ress of the Brahman across whose path even the shadow of
the despt Sudra falling would be deemed defilement. Not any of these,
can equa the intolerant religions pride of the Mahommedan, or reach the
pinnacle of religious selfsufticiency on which he has seated himself. “Vo be
a Mahommedan, is enough—Ce/a sifjit.

‘To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahommedans, and
intimate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahenimedan is above all things a Mahommedan. His
reheion is the paramount question in his life, and remains its predominating
feature above everything else. ‘This should not be surprising, since to the
faithful” Paradise is secured, and all crimes and transeressions against
‘unbelievers absolved.
