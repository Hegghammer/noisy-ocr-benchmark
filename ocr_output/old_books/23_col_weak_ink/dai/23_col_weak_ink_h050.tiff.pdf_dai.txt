occasionally amuses himself in hunting and fishing. His integrity,

of his life :
I was born in Yorktown, Westchester County, New York, 15
September, 1806. My parents were farmers, in moderate circum-
stances. I remained with them until I was seventeen, working on the
farm in the summer, and going to school in the winter, thus acquiring
merely a common-school education. When I was seventeen years old,
at the sugation of my parents, I decided to learn the blacksmith
trade, and

“In 1862 we all sold ont to a stock company, formed for that pur-

In the spring of 1855 I was elected Supervisor of the town of Cort-

years in succession.
"In the winter of 1858, I was a member of the Legislature from

our village, but of late have declined official stations, preferring the
enjoyments of private life."
Mr. Horton is not a public professor of Christianity, but is a gen-
tleman of correct moral deportment, and very temperate in his habits.
