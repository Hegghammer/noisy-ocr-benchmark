THE CORSET AND THE CRINOLINE,
13
Investigation proves to us that the taste for slender waists prevailed
even more in the Eastern nations than in those of Europe, and we find
that other means besides that of compression have been extensively
taken advantage of. Humboldt, in his personal narrative, describes the
women of Java, and informs us that the reddish clay called "ampo” is
eaten by them in order that they may become slim, want of plumpness
being a kind of beauty in that country. Though the use of this
earth is fatal to health, those desirous of profiting by its reducing

and no young lady is considered the erfection ashionable elegance

will be seen that this
standard for the perfection of

Pacific and Indian Ocean we have

of Crim Tartary and the rock-cro
of Circassia, to see the
same tastes prevailing, and ever e pote
eans in force for the
obtainment of a taper form. A marks fr us as to the beauty of
the ladies of Circassia would be edless, the claim to that enviable
endowment being too well est ished to call for confirmation at our
hands, and that no pains are ared in the formation of their figures
will be best seen by a quotation from a recent traveller who writes on
the subject :—
"What would” (he says) "our ladies think of this fashion on the part
of the far-famed beauties of Circassia? The women wear a corset made of
‘morocco,' and furnished with two plates of wood placed on the chest,
