AND WHEREFORE.
In making a study of my race, I have found three marked characteristics
Intelligence Energy-Industry. Contined with these three characteristics
is an intense Love of Nationality. We live in a complex world. In an
independent people these characte ics and this sentiment are laudable
Virtues. In a subject people they Crimes.
After I had laid this bitter T- to heart, I did not have to seek for the
Why and Wherefore of the Arpa Massacres.
The Armenian Massacres without their parallel in history. The
inuman mind staggers to conte
e the fiendish orgies of which they have
been the victims, and no per escribe their horrors and this helpless
christian people are to-day ame deadly peril as they have been since
the famous Treaty of Ber gned them bound hand and foot to the
mercy of their execution
The Armenians my
as sheep to the slaughter" and the
work of extermination
-Jesus Christ was crucified on
Calvary and the serve is not gree
is Lord-but the work of their
extermination can only be completed when vil influences in the Turkish
Empire have reached their culminating point Witherto the Powers of
Europe have by their jealousies and rivalries cultivated these evil influences,
they have watered them and made them grow, but when their culminating
point is reached, they must re-act on Christendom and the natural
consequence must follow. Those who sow the wind, must reap the whirl-
wind. It is in the natural order of things.
I will allow that Liberty, Justice, Equality, Fraternity are the watchwords
of Young Turkey, but Young Turkey is only a small minority; the great
majority of the Turkish nation are not Young Turks.
The question therefore resolves itself into this critical point: "What will
Christendom do even now?‚Äù
