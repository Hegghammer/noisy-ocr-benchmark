Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt; this super-added evil, is, the
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, greater marauders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation of whose lives comprises
murder and robbery, and who have through w centuries unremittingly
quartered themselves upon the industrious chan peasants, and lived on
the fruits of their labour and toil. Indeed e Hamidich cavalry which
was established expressly for the Hami massacres was composed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of si on what outlet these warriors,
trained and practised in organized my an now find for those habits in
which they were encouraged an A to indulge by the Hamidian
régime.
Under all such conditions
better days can be forthcoming,
no prospect of better times,

Armenian race whom,

Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfort,

countries guarantees to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil.
