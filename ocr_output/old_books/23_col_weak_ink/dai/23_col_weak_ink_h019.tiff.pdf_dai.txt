MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE.
It will be seen by the engraving that the old house is double. The
western part is that which was built by Barnabas in 1659-60. The
enst or two story part was built by Jonathan I., about 1682. The upper
room of this part was used for a court-house for nearly twenty years,
as we learn from Thompson's History of Long Island, and some of
the old benches used when it was a court-house are still preserved.

With a few repairs, the old castle may yet stand for generations far
in the future.
It requires some thought and reflection to realize the lapse of time
since the old house was built. See the old Puritan himself there
