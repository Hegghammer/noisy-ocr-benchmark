SCENE OF THE MASSACRES IN ASTA MIÑO
The trouble began in Adana. ` An armed mob strengthened and augmen. soldiers
fell in overwhelming numbers upon the marmed Christians. The Armenian pention of
Antioch and vicinity were practically wiped out and the Armenian villages in the
Alexandretta district destroyed with immense loss of life. Hadjin, Kessab and the neigh-
bouring villages were burnel. The Armenian quarter in Tursus was ruined and ill-omeñed
Marash stained again with the blood of thousands of Armenians, Zeitoon was desolated. The
entire population of Kirikon between Aleppo and Alexandretta were massacred to the last
babe. The mob and the soldiers burned what they could not carry away, so that the material
loss has been enormous. In place of the former abundance and thriving industries there are
instead desolated provinces and the charred and blackened remains of pillaged and ruined
homes, and the residue of those who escaped massacre are reduced to homelessness and
starvation.
