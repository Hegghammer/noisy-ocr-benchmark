CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
3
Every artist does best, that which he is best qualified and best disposed to do. In com-
pleting the number of plates that has been found necessary for the Work, Mr. Edwin LandSEER
has chosen to proceed toward the same purpose, y a different principle. He has gone, without
any inductory medium, directly to the living a s, and has exhibited the savage manners and
habits o
madrupeds, according to his ow and observations.
On the
between CHARACTER
ESSION, we shall now deliver our opinion.
By the Cha
mal, we mean t
encies of his look and features which he
always offers
cid, or
state by his Expression, the variations
of muscular act
is liable, as the storms of passion sweep
by, and his mind
es acting on the ardours of his instinct.
The former, see
massy parts: the latter, agitates, oft-
times rebelliously, the
ever present, both in the animal coun-
tenance, and in the "
ce divine
at expression does not proscribe, or
obliterate, character. In duality consists
oncerns external appearance; and it
forms the system of vowels of the language of Na
which no Expression could be.
Whoever regards the faces of a flock of Sheep, wh em an infinite variety of Character,
with very little Expression, and that little without divers d if we descend a step lower in
the scale of being, and contemplate the finny tribe, where acter is not wanting, we find no
Expression at all. Even Trees and inanimate objects, possess Caracter. We recollect a poetical
friend of ours, now in Italy, saying that every tree and every rock had a face-but of this we are
not so certain; though very certain, that there is enough of Character in rocks and trees, to make
a poet think so.
Character and Expression, in the carnivorous class of animals, to which we here solicit
attention, are always co-existent - their proportions varying with the existing occasions — in
pictorial exhibitions of such subjects.
No. II.
THERE is much Character, and little Expression, in the reposing Leopard with his sheathed
claws, which is shewn in the present engraving, copied by Mr. SPILSBURY from RIDINGER, and
corrected from Nature. RIDINGER was an artist of great power, who studied wild animals in
their sequestered baunts, as is shewn in his grand forest back-grounds; and who, generally
speaking, left little or no room for others to improve, except on some few of his inferiór works.
The present is an interesting and beautiful animal, yet there is a latent capability of mischief
characterised in his countenance, and we might ask, in the language of Job, "Who shall dare to
rouse him up ?"
