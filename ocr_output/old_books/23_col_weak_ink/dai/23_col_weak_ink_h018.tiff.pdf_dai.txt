It is said that Barnabas Horton 1. was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities.
His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It is elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. The original base was of brick, but it had all crambled down
many years ago. The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Horton.
The inscription surrounds the border of the

follows:
“Here Heth buried the body of Mr. Barnany
Monsuly, Leicestershire, Old England, and died
July, 1680, ngut. So yunts.”
In the centre of the stone we find

It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it, to-
gether with the inscription, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the original
thirteen who bronght his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and memory
should not perish from the earth.
