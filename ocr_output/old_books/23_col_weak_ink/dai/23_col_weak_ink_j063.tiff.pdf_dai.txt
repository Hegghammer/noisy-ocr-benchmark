REED AND SPLINT WEAVING

mable, and should be used in a room in which there is free circula-
tion of air. If colors have been mixed properly and thinned to the
right consistency, the reed will dry rapidly and the color will be
sharp and clear, free from muddy effects.
A woven article such as a basket or woven top footstool may be
dipped, or the color poured over and allowed to drip dry. In some
instances it is good policy to wipe surplus stain off lightly. Then,
in the case of the footstool or similar project, if the worker so
desires he may stain the wood a darker shade than the top with a
prepared stain. Reed is very effective without stain; many of the
stools shown herewith are left natural. Reed may be shellacked or
varnished. Because of its porosity it soils very casily unless som
finishing agent is used, and a good grade of elastic varnish is recom
mended as a finish, especially when the woven article is subject
severe use.
Other Materials.-Reed is not the only good medium adapt
to weaving, either in correlation with wood or when used alo
On the stools illustrated several other materials have been us
as inner hickory bark and Indian splints and fiber. Binding c
rope, and even willow may be utilized with success. Paper

Sufficient to say that this fiber adapts itself admirably to a
all work where reed is commonly employed, and in many
ins
is, commercially, supplanting reed.
Inner hickory bark may be obtained of manufacturers of
furniture either directly or indirectly. They may be obtain
hand if hickory trees grow in the locality, thus enhancing
cational value of weaving. In the spring or early summ
the sap is up and the bark slips easily, a hickory tree ma
down, and the rough outer bark shaved with a draw kn
