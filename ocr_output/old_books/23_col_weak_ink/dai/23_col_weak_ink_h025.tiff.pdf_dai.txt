NOTE.
The reader will see at a glance
mence with the Christian nan
logical dain, &c., and then the Christiaan
order of births. In many of the early families the exact order of
births cannot be ascertained; but it has been approximated as nearly
as possible. The lineage is given in connection with the first member
of the family. The Roman numerals indicate the order of births.
The sons and daughters of the old Puritan, Barnahas, constitue the
second generation, but they are spoken by way of eminence as Joseph
I., Hannah I., &c. The book contains much repetition, but none
too much to make it plain and easy to study.
This litle book contains the chronicles of only about one-half of
the Horton families looked up. Those whose genealogical data are
given only in a small part, and those whose correct lineage has not
been satisfactorily ascertained, are not included in this book.
