PREFACE.

"
THE subject which we have here treated is a sort of figura
battle-field, where fierce contests have for ages been from time ne
waged; and, notwithstanding the determined assaults of the
hosts, the contention and its cause remain pretty much as they at the
commencement of the war. We in the matter remain neutral,
merely performing the part of to
own corres
making
it our duty to gather together such
oth ancient
and modern, as may prove interesting
note of the
vicissitudes of war, mark its various
to do our best
to lay clearly before our readers the hi
experiences and
arguments relating to the much-discussed
stion."
As most of our readers are aware, the journals especially
intended for the perusal of ladies have been for
ny years the media
for the exchange of a vast number of letters papers touching
the use of the Corset. The questions relating to the history of
this apparently indispensable article of ladies' attire, its construction,
application, and influence on the figure have become so numerous of late
that we have thought, by embodying all that we can glean and garner
relating to Corsets, their wearers, and the various costumes worn by
ladies at different periods, arranging the subject-matter in its due order
as to dates, and at the same time availing ourselves of careful illustration
when needed, that an interesting volume would result.
