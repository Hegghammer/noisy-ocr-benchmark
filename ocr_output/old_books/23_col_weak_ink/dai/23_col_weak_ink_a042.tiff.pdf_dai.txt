Van, and the lowest estimate comuted the murdered dead at 102,009. Gladstone made the
last great speech of his heroic lite. England attempted some kind of protest. But rather
than join the Liberal demand for action, Land Rosebery left his party for private leisure, and
Russia, France, and Germany combined to secure immunity for the "great assussin." It
was the lowest point of Europe's shame.
Blow followed blow. Hardly had the remnant of the Armenian people escaped from
massacre when their Church fell under the brutal domination of Russia. Plahve ordained its
destruction, and Golitzin was sent to Tiflis as governor-general to carry it out. Church
property to the value of 65,000,000 was seized by violence, the Katholikos resolutely refusing
to give up the keys of i fe where the title dels were kept (Jani, 1903). For two years
the Russian officials y with the revenues, retaining eighty per cent. for their own
me assassination had rid the earth of Plehve, and the over-
whelming defeats of Ru nchuria were attributed to the Armenian curse. Grudgingly

to concede all the frontive district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian villages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Caucasus wins federal
autonomy. But the majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
cfforts to education and industries. One cannot yet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolutionary parties of "The Bell" and "The Flag." Of these,
the Social Democratic "Bell" follows the usual impracticable and pedantic creed of St. Mary,

universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Charch property

with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.
Whatever may be the political future of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion. Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival." It is a thousand years since they could bé
