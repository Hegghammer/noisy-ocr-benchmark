THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
came on without sails or oars. It was a shining
boat, a boat of brass. I called to my father and
my father straightened himself up and watched it.
In the boat that came toward us of its own accord
there was a man standing.
The boat came into the full water between the
rocks, and then it sank down, this boat of brass, un-
til its rim touched the water. Jemained still as
if anchored. The man who w he prow of the
boat stepped out on the sa een my father
and me.
He looked a man of
like a prince
or a potentate. He
and a dark,
curly beard, and by
re like hawks'
eyes. He had
of a blue
material cove
ious figures,
and in his
olished staff
that had
crpe
isting to-
gether. He looked at me and I was ened of
him, and I turned to my father. But ther
was standing there, holding the fishing p
his hands, his mouth open, gasping like one of
fishes upon the rocks.
