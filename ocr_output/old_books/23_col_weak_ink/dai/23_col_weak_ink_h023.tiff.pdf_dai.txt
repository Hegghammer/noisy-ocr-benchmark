Jeremiair also settled in Massachusetts. There was a John Horton in
New York, in 1645, but no one has been found claiming descent from
him. He probably returned to England.
It is not known from what place in England either Thomas or Jere-
minh came, nor is there any certain evidence that they were brothers
of Barnabas, but the three coming over about the same time would
favor the tradition that they were brothers.

It is held that this Joseph settled in Mousely, Leicester Co., and
was the father of Barnabas Horton. It is highly probable that Bar-
