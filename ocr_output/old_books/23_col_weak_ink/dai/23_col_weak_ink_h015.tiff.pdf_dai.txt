‘HORTON ARMS.
DERBYSHIRE.
A stag's head cabossed, silver; attired, gold; and, for distinction, a canton ermi
Crest, out of the waves of the sea proper, a tilting spear erect, gold; enfiled with
silver, finned, gold, and charged with a shell,
[ Cabossed means cut off short so as not to show the neck; attired denotes
erming, means the black spots upon the white field in the left-hand corne
artist has not given the shell upon the dolphin.]
Motte.—“Quod Vult, Valde VULT,"—What he wills, he wills
and coithout stint.
Arms are hereditary, but the mottoes are not, and may be changed to At the taste or fancy of
any family. There are other Arms of the Horton family, varying som hat from the above. The
date of the grant of the arms I have not found-probably many cont es ago.
