PREFACE
ix
Most of us like to keep a few of the illusions
we believed in when schoolboys. Scientific his-
torians have degraded many of our ancient heroes
and exalted the villains,
for whom
of old no
mad was too thick and slab. Beliefs are being
assailed on ceery
side. To abolish the traditional
courtesy of Claude Du Fall or the considerate
conduct of Captain Hind would, therefore, be
strokes of the unkindest, and I have here attempted
no such iconoclasm. Even where I cannot be-
lieve, I have told the tale-whenever it has been
worth the telling as it is found in criminal
trials, or in Smith or Johnson, and other old
sources, decorously stripped of much vile language.
For really, where much that seems
may be fully proved, and where
turns out not rarely to be false, '
To continue the story of
Smith and Johnson down
of all such things in
teenth century, is like
a half-told tale. But
Only in respect of the g
has
always made, has it been found really necessary
to seriously consider and re-state the career of
that much-overrated scoundrel, and to put him
in his proper place: a very muchvery much 
lower one
than he usually occupies.
