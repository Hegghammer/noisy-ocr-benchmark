Thus, near the end of last December, one of a century's greatest men-Mgrditch
Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people-slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or "The Only-Begotten

frost bound plain of the Arna here the vines were now all cat close and buried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stod mass of whirling snow and hurricane that hid the

shore of that lake, eighty-seven

was filling. The pitiless slaughter of Bulgations and
Armeniaus alike was more than even the European Powers could stand. With varied motives,
Russia sent her armies to fight their way to the walls of Constantinople, and Khrimian found
himself summoned to plead his people's cause before the Congress of Berlin. Though he
speaks no language but Armenian and Turkish, he visited all the great courts of Enrope
beforehand, urging them to create an autonomous neutral state for Armenia, as they had
done with success for the Lebanon. In London he became acquainted with Gladstong ; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kimlled the heart of England, and,
in the Congress itself Khrimian could gain nothing for his people beyond the promises of
Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey's definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London amid shouts of "Peace with Honor,"
and Armenia was left to stew.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last inculenlable
