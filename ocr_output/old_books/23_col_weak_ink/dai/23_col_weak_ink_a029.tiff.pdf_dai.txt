PART I.
THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY OF BERLIN,
Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the still more famous Treaty
of Berlin, the martyr roll of the fortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel in history.
In the Guildhall at Be angs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city on Ju irteenth 1878. The painter has depicted
the proud array of repres of the powerful Governments of Europe,
but in the interests of
ere should be attached to that painting
the wording of Article
aty of Berlin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).
It was a curious
that although the taking of "the
terrible stronghold of Ka
ly admitted to be one of the greatest
and most difficult military
achieved, and the crowning success
of the Russian arms in Asta
should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General; that
Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest, a
menian soldiers fought, conquered and
died, yet by these successes ne ly was no amelioration attained of the
hard Å¿ate of their unhappy natio nder Turkish rule, but that fate, hard
before, was made a hundredfold an even a thousandfold harder.
GENERAL ERINCE LOKIS MEHIKOFF.
Commanded the Russian forces in Asiatic Turkey
during the Russo-Turkish war and captured the im-
pregnable fortress of Kars. Appointed Prime Minister
of Russia by Alexander II. The liberal policy which
characterized the reign of that excellent monarch, and
the Constitution that he was on the eve of granting to
his people were influenced by Melikoff ; but after the
death of Alexander 1 he was not allowed to continue in
his good work of reforming Russia, being overthrown
from office early in the reign of Alexander III.
