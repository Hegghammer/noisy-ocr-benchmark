That the Armenians should be constantly appealing to the Power that
had pledged itself for their protection, and that the same Power should be
constantly rallying the others, and making Ambassadorial demonstrations,
was enough to rouse the vilest passions of a nature in which no feelings
except vile passions existed.
Of all sins world perhaps the sin of foolishness receives the
severest punishment,
the crime of failure meets with the
heaviest doom. For the
Puropean protection
and hoping for European inter
ans paid with
rivers of their own blood, and for
ey were made to
wallow in that blood. The darkest pas
have been written
in the closing years of the nineteenth, and
ears of the twentieth
century; never since the loss of their ind
nine centuries ago, had
they hoped for so much, and never had tl so dearly for their folly.
If they had carefully laid to heart tl ole history of Europe's inter-
course with Asia, beginning with the conqu s of the Macedonian Alexander;
they would have read in the light of sobe adgement, self-interest, and self-
interest only written on every line and but they committed the folly of
GENERAL TER GOUKASSOFF.
Relieved the beleaguered Russian garrison
at Bayazid during the Russo-Turkish war of
187, captured the fortress; and otherwise
dis inguished himself during the war.
The other Armenian General who dis-
tinguished himself during the Russo-Turkish
war was General Lazaroff.
