The efforts of the Armenians, and the entreaties of their Patriarch
Nerses had procured the insertion of Article 16 in the Treaty of San
Stefano signed between Russia and Turkey in March 1878. In fact the
wording of the Article had been suggested by the Patriarch himself. It
provided the following stipulation for the protection of the Armenians :-
"As the evacuation by the Russian troops of the territory which they
now occupy in Armenia, and which is to be restored to Turkey, might give
rise to conflicts and complications detrimental to the maintenace of good
relations between the two countries, the Sublime Porte enga

could furnish food for laughter were it not for the terrible tragedy involved
in it.
The insertion of Article 61 in the Treaty of Berlin, granted, or rather
scemingly granted, by the six Powers of Europe, proved in reality, as sub-
sequent events bore out, an instrument of death and torture. It was as if

protection, and with the death of the Czar Liberator, the last chance of the
Armenians died.
