earth as other nations? Does Humanity,'docs Christianity allow that tender
babes and children should be hideously and horribly mutilated and butchered
before the eyes of their mothers, or that the cars of mothers should be rent
with the cries of the dying agony of their murdered children? Does
Humanity, does Christianity allow that helpless women should be forcibly
subjected to the most hideons, the most loathsome, the most revolting, and
the most cruel outrages? Does Humanity, does Christianity, allow all this?
Christian Governments have organized a Hague Conference of Peace
and Civilization, but they have closed its doors to the cause of a bleeding
christian race groaning under the yoke of the cruellest oppressors that the
world has yet known." Christian men and women have held up their hands
in horror at the Indian Juggernauth; but_alas! the political who of
