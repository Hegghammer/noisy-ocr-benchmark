back the inner bark the full length of the log This process may
be repeated until the log is stripped. The thickness of the inner
bark depends upon the size of the tree and the species, Manu-
facturers of hickory furniture claim that the pignut possesses a
thicker bark than any other species, the bark running from 4 in.
to 34 in. in thickness, and they accordingly use this tree in pref-

erence to others when available. The rolls of thick inner bark are
allowed to dry for several weeks. Then they are placed in water,
to remain until pliable. They are then split into strips of proper
thickness and width. Factories use a very simple motor driven
machine for making the strips, and any manual training shop can
devise some scheme for accomplishing this work. These strips cut
in indefinite lengths must be made pliant by a thoro soaking just
previous to use. In weaving they should be pressed close together
with the fingers or with the aid of a hammer, as there is an appreci-
able shrinkage especially in their width upon drying. Such strips
are used mainly by builders of rustic outdoor and porch furniture
for the weaving of the backs, arms and seats of chairs, and have
at present no general use in school shops. Their use here should
be encouraged. If bought of the manufacturer these strips cost 40
cents per pound, dry. They are put up in coils, and are 34 in. wide
and 1/16 in. thick. They may be stripped into narrower widths
by means of a hand stripper, soon to be described.
