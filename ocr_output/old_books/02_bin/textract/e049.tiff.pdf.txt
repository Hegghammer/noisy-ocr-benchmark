find the dresses worn extremely tight, and so made as to define the waist
and render it as slim as possible; and although the art of making the
description of corsets worn by the ladies of Rome was no doubt at that
time lost, the revived taste for slender figures led to the peculiar form of
corsage known as cottes bardies, which were much stiffened and worn
extremely tight. These took the place of the quaint, oddly-formed
robes we see draping the figures of Childeric's and Pepin's queens. The
" cottes bardies" were, moreover, clasped at the waist by a broad belt, and
seem pretty well to have merited their martial name. Very soon after
this period it is probable that a much more complete description of
