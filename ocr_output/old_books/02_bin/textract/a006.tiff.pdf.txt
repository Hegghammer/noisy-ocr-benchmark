When this book was written, the writer was
under the supposition then generally current that
the Armenian Massacres of April, 1909, in Cilicia
were instigated by Abd-ul Hamid and his Yildiz
Clique. Babikian Effendi, the Armenian deputy
who went to Adana from Constantinople to in-
vestigate into the massacres, plainly reported that
all investigations had failed to trace them to Abd- ul
Hamid and his Yildiz Clique. Babikian Effendi,
as was to be expected, died suddenly on his return
to Constantinople, but later on it became known
that themassacres of April, 1909, adbeen planned,
prepared, organized and carried into execution by
VE
the Constitutional Government of what has been
talled 'Liberal Turks" or "Young Turks."
