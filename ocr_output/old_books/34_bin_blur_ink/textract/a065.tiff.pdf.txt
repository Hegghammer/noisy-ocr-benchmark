Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Emoire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt ; this super-added evil, is, the
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, greater marauders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation of whose lives comprise
murder and robbery, and who have throu th weary centuries unremittingl
quartered themselves upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits of their labour and toil. Indeed as the Hamidich
which
was established expressly for the I lamidian massactes
w
losed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation what
rriors,
trained and practised in organized murder, can now fine
bits in
which they were encouraged and trained to ind
hidian
régime.
Under all such conditions no hope of better
ming,
no prospect of better times seems possible, for
If the
Armenian race whom torce of circumstances
f the
fatherland.
The appointment of Christian governors (1V
in-
habited by them might ameliorate some of the evils, om
tive,
of allowing the use ui arms to all alike, irrespee
or
nationality, would furnish some means of self-icfence
aids
and barbarities of the oppressors; but even if such concession
ted,
life for the christian peasant subject to Turkish rule, and livib.
idst
of his enemies, must remain one long struggle and battle aga
ge,
murder, depredation, and ottences of the worst nature. Notthe
tile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the most
bus
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, can bring
he
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that con
rt,
happiness, and security of life and property, which the law of all civillited
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil.
