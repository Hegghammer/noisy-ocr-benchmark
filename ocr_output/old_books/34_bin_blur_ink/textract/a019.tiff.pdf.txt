TO 2ND PRINTING
My object in writing this little book is
the hard case of my un-
fortunate race before the men and wo
United States : since it is
from the United States that the Amy
maries have gone forth, who
have been the only helping intlue
lut for my suffering people in
Asiatic Turkey. To the e

the sulphur tlames of religious fanaticism burst, the lava floods of race hatred
and lust of plunder, break forth and run in fiery streams the unfortunate
victims are pounced upon, swooped upon, pillaged, plundered, butchered,
slaughtered, subjected to outrages so hideous, cruel, loathsome, and revolt-
ing, that no pen could depict their horrible realities and the details can never
go into print. The human mind is staggered and asks itself the question ii
