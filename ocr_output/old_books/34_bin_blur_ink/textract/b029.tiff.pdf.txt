CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

au opposite theory, in which instinctive agrency is rejected, and the appearances are explained from
a consideration of the necessities and voluntary exertions of the animal. With regard to the
observer, it has been a that it is by experience alone that he distinguishes the signs of the
passions; that we learn, in
smiles as
ressions of kindness, because they
are accompanied by acts of be
frowns as the coutrary, because
we find them followed by blows

been observed to precede his biting
S, his fawning and licking of the hand.
With regard to the creature itself, it is Sh.

merely the concomitants of those voluitary
ich the passions or habits suggest that
the glare of the Lion's eve, for example, is the
a voluntary exertion to see his prey
more clearly - his grin, or snarl, the natural motion
his faugs before he uses them.
This, however, is not quite true of all animals and of an
on of passion."
"Attendiug merely to the evideuce furnished by all.
1 investigation, all that I shall
venture to affirm is this : that a remarkable difference is to DE and between the anatomy and
range of expression, in man and in animals : that in the former re seems to be a systematic
provision for that mode of communication and that natural language, which is to be read in the
changes of the countenance that there is no emotion in the mind of man which has not its
appropriate signs: and that there are even muscles in the human face to which 110 other use can be
assigned than to serve as the organs of this language : that, on the other hand, there is in the lower
animals no range of expression which is not fairly referable as a mere accessary to the voluntary
or needful actions of the animal; and that this accessary expression does not appear to be in any
degree commensurate to the variety and extent of the animal's passions."
" There appears to me (continues Mn. BELI.) to be no expression in the face of any aninal
lower in the scale of being than quadrupeds; and in them the strongest and most marked
expression is that of rage; the object of which is opposition, resistance, and defence. But ou
examination it will be found (rousistently with the position, that this is merely an accessary of
the motions natural to the accomplishment of the object which the animal has in view) that the
streugth of the expression is in exact proportion to the strength of the principal action in the
creature when thus excited.
"The gramnivorous animals, which seek their subsistence, not by preying upon others, nor by
the ferocity, contest, and victory which supply the carnivorous with food, have in their features no
strong expression of rage. Their expression is chiefly confined indeed to the effect produced on the
general system. Thus the inflamed eye and the breathing nostrils of the Bull, are induced ouly
by the general excitement. His only proper expression of rage, is in the position of the head,
with the horns turned obliquely to the ground, ready to strike : and indeed it may be observed
in general that animals which strike with the horns, shew little indication of fear or rage, except in
