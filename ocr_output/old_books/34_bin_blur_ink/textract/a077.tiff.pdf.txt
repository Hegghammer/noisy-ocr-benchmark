I will again pass wirl the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and relate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
796 after ruling over Ammenia filty.cight years.
He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his dominions, and
grew to be so mighty in battle that the neighbouring nations called his
country Aramia and the people were called Aramians, such names as
Armenia or Armenians being no doubt later corruption
The tirst victory of Aram was over Neuchar kin
edia, whom he
took prisoner and put to death, and made a large pa
re country of the
defeated prince tributary in his own. The second
of Aram was over
Barsham king of Babylon, whom also he took
P
Er and put to death.
The next victory was over the king of Capi
fia : the army of the
Cappadocians was pursued to the very shores of
Mediterranean, and the
whole of Cappadocia fell into the hands of Ara B.C. 1796. Also Ninus
king of Assyria, at one time an cager enemy,
ed by the victories of Aram,
sought to cultivate his friendship.

preserved instead, vast treasures of

the ancient kingdoms of Western

much of the story and history
as lost and destroyed along
with the diestruction of their ind

or asseit, but in taking up lin
ever knowledge has been left
to us, there seems to be
bsing that the Aramicans'
designated by foreign wri
of Semitic race language and
religion, coming from Northern
ettling in the region between
the western boundaries of Babylonia and the "highlands of Western .\sia'
were no other than the I fai who under their King Aram had spread their
conquests and their kingdom into Mesopotamia and even to the shores of
the Mediterranean.
Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when be includes
Northern Mesopotamia, together with the mountainous country of Ararat,
under the name of Armenia, and in writing of the Armenian boats that
brought merchandise to Babylon, iic remarks that they were constructed in
Armenia, in tite parts above
Archacological researches have laid the ciaim that the modern Armenians
are the descendants of the old Hittites : the modern Armenian being supposed
