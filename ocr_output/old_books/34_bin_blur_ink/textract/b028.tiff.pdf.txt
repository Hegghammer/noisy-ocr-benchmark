CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.
and carnivorous habits. They walk on their toes : vet not so much from that habitual stealthiness
of pace, by which they advance unperceived till within a spring of their prey; as because it is also
the means of that celerity of motion which is necessary to the very existence of animals that can
fleed only on flesh.
Their claws are exceeding] powerfil
they are enabled to draw them up into sheaths
between their toes, so as to for
points from touching the ground; whenee they are
called retractile and those
cousequence, always kept sharp, unworn, and ready for
active service.
The eyes
every face in nature a striking and important feature-vary
in the différent sp
capable of much alteration in the same animal; as instinctive
impulse, or internal
changes the expression of his countenance; and also from the
degrees of light whi
upon their pupils. Of Lions the pupils of the eves are circular, and
not of a vellow
as has been stated in the most diffuse modern dissertations on the
Carnivora, but
It is the iris of the Lion's ere that is yellow. They appear to be best
suited
to
noety
2, or twilight, vision : and hence the Lion rarely hunts his prey while the sun
is
above the orizon-perbaps never. but when pressed by hunger in an extraordinary degree.
The
Tiger, the contrary, will seek his prey by day as well as by niglt and during twilight the
colour offils eyes is that of a blue-green flame. If a stranger passes near a Tiger in a menagerie,
the colour of the animal's eses will sometimes alter suddenly, from vellow-green to blue-green
;
not
from any alteration in the degree of light acting upon them, but from mental excitement, and
from a certain natural facility of expansion and contraction of the eve-pupils.
Hence a characteristic difference betwee 11 the Lion and the Tiger. The habits of the latter
are diurnal, and he disregards night-fires the Lion, on the contrary, whose eyes are not calculated
for the glare of day, cannot bear to encounter fire-light at night. Yet these physical conforma-
tions are sometimes overcome by the rage of hunger and hence, in Mn. EDWIN LANDSEER's
contending group, the Lion is represented as attacking the Tiger although it be day.
MR. BELL treats learnedly, and we believe with much originality, of the facial-muscles of
this class of quadrupeds, in his " Anatomy of Expression."- We shall offer a few extracts,
by
which the reader will perceive how limited are their powers of expression of countenance, when
compared with those of human nature, notwithstanding their superiority over all other quadrupeds.
The violent passions mark themselves so distinctly on the countenances both of men and
of animals, that we are apt in the first instance to consider the movements by which they are
indicated, as certain signs or characters provided by Nature, for the express purpose of intimating
the internal emotion ; and to suppose that they are interpreted by the observer in consequence of a
peculiar and instinetive faculty. This view of things, however, so natural at first sight, is not
altogether satisfactory to philosophy, and a more jealous observation of the facts, seems to suggest
