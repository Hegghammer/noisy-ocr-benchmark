The cathedral of Etchmiatzin is identitied with Gregory ; its name
Etchmiatzin means in the Armenian language "the only begotten is
descended," and the story attached to it is, that in a vision Christ appeared

the vision had appeared to him, giving it the name of "Etchmiatzin" (only
begotten descended). The cathedral also gives its name to the town
Etchmiatzin, the ecclesiastical inctropolis of Armenia.
