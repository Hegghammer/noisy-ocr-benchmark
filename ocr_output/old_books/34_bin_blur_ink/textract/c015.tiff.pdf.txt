PROLOGUE
THE HORSES OF KING MANUS
As for the youth who had tried to steal the white
horse that the King owned, he was bound hand
and foot and taken into the castle of the King.
There he was thrown down beside the trestles of
the great table, and the hot wax from the candles
that lighted the supper board dripped down pon
him. And it was told to him that at the mo
w's
sunrise he would be slain with the sword.
Then the King called upon one to
f
the
story that was being told when the
of
the white horse was heard in the
e
story could not be finished for h
cr,
because the one who had been telling
low
outside, guarding the iron door of the
with
a sword in his hand. And King Ma
litting
at the supper board, could not eat
refresh
himself because there was no one at han
to
finish
the story for him.
