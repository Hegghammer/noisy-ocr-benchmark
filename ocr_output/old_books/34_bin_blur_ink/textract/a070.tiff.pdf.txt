victims in thy Yildiz Kiosk, found its way to thy treacherous heart. No
poisoned cup of coftee like the countless cups brewed in thy palaces trickled
down thy throat to end thy vampire existence.
Thou hast lived ! Protected from the Nemesis of thy crimes by the
jealousies and rivalries of great powers which thou artfully played one against
another : by the combined forces of religion and plunder which thou cunningly
wielded into one. Even so thou livest! Poerless living example in the
civilized mentifin century of the Triumph of Crime.
L'AVENIR.
In the joregoing pages I have di
fforts to sketch out
what the Powers of Europe have

have
carried out that hellish work of wholesale extermination of the
Armenians without the perperration and participation of the Turkish
people. It is true the massacres were originated and organized in the
Palace, the Palace dique stirred up religious fanaticism and race hatred.
but
the co-operation of the people was necessary and the people co-operated
in order to plunder and enrich thenselves with the woridly goods that the
Armenians always knew how to acquire by the ir own industry and toil ; the
appeal to their marauding and bestial instincts met with a ready response.
It was moreover casy work for a race of brigands, especially as their numbers
exceeded their victims by about tento one and who were practically unarmed.
