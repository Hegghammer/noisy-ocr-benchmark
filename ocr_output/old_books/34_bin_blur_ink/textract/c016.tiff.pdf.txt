THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
And that is the way that the story of The Boy
Apprenticed to an Enchanter used to begin.
But first I shall have to tell you about King
Manus and his three horses.
King Manus ruled over the Western Island, and
he had a castle that was neither higher nor wider
than any other King's castle. But he had a stable
that was more strongly built than any other King's
stable. It had double walls of stone; it had oak
beams: it had an iron door with four locks to it.
And before this door two soldiers with drawn
swords in their hands stayed night and day.
In those days, if one went before a King
asked him for a gift the King might not rg
give what was asked of him. But Ki

before the chamber where he sat
here
stood a servant to take the requ'

excuse for the King.
It was all because of tly King's t horses -
a white horse, a red borse, and a black horse.
The white horse was 35 swift as the Munging wave
