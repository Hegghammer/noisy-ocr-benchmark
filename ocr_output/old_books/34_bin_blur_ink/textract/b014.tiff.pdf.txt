Of this fact, however, we purpese to exhibit proot with our assertion. Improved versions, to
the best abilities of our Artists, of ome of these ons of RUBENS and the Assyrian king, will here
be introduced, which the reader, no plea Av compare with the originals. Our second, third,

However such depesed Lions may be thought to accord with Allegory, they are demonstrably
at variance with Nature. To be sure, what might become a Lion in the procession of the Cardinal
Virtues, might be rather unsuitable in lis den, or within the precinets of those wild haunts, where be

taurs,) and we find such: on the coinage of C'rete. These allegrorieal creatures of RUBENS, which,
alas have sometimes been quoted by Artists without half his geuius, and placed in savage con-
flicts. or beside their Britannias-- are a species of Men-lions. l'laced among the Sabaran sculp-
tures, they might pass for incarnations of Sol in Leo; but would very ill pass for Leo alone.
Among the observers of this poetic improvement, or this natural and unpoetical deficieuey, on
the part of RUBENS, TITIAN, JULIO ROMANO, and other painters, both ancient and modern; and
of the consequent desideration on the part of the public, of a cabinet or library collection of the
nobler wild animals in a state of Nature, so as to auswer the purposes of reference, while they con-
duced to the pleasures of Taste, were Mr. EDGAR SPILSBURY and Mr. THOMAS LANDSEER.
Whether or not the public "looked up to them for light" on that subject, (to use the language of
STERNE,) they thonglt the Public "deserved it ", and they therefore, as the best practical means
of eliciting that light, first copied the general forms and attitudes of most of the wild aninials that
appear in this book, from the old masters-geuerally speaking, from works that are well known
-and then, went to Nature and corrected the details. They carried with them what, in those
ancient masters, was meritorious in composition, attitude and chiaroscuro, and brought away,
to the best of their bility-superadding it to, and blending it with, the above-uccuraey of
detail.
