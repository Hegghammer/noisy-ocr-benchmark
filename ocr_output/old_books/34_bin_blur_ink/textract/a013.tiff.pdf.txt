WHY AND WHEREFORE
la making a study of my race, Ihat jound three marked characteristics
ntelligence-Energy-Industry. Combir vith these three characteristics
is an intense Love of Nationality. 11c
a complex world. In an
independent people these characteristics a
sentiment are laudall
Virtues. In a subject people they are: Crimes
After I had laid this bitter Truth to heart,
scek for the
Why and Wherefore of the Armenian Massacro
The Armenian Massacres stand withont tl
allel in history. The
human mind staggers to contemplate the fur
n orgies of which they have
been the victims, and 00 pen can diescria their horrors : and this helpless
christian people are to-day in the deadly peril as they have been since
the famous Treaty of Berlin vosigned them bound hand and foot to the
mercy of their executiones.
The Armenians may be led again 'as sheep to the slaughter" and the
work of extermination may be completed!-|esus Christ was crucified on
Calvary and the servant is not greater than his Lord-but the work of their
extermination can only be completed when the evil intluences in the Turkish
Empire have reached their culminating point. Hitherto the Powers of
Europe have by their jealousies and rivalries cultivated these evil influences,
they have watered them and made them grow, but when their culminating
point is reached, they must reaat on Christendom and the natural
consequence must follow. Those who sow the wind, must reap the whirl-
wind. It is in the natural order of things.
I will allow that Liberty, Justice, Equality, Fraternity are the warchwords
of Young Turkey, but Young Turkey is only a small minority ; the great
majority of the Turkish nation are not Young Turks.
The question therefore resolves itselfinto this critical point : What will
Christendom do even now?
