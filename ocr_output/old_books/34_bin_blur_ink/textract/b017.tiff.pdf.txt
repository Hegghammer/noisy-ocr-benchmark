CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

Every artist does best, that which he is best qualified and best disposed to do. In com-
pletifg the number of plates that has been found necessary for the Work, Mr. EDWIN LANDSEER
has
c sen to proceed toward the saine purpose, upon a different principle. He has gone, without
any in
tory medium, directly to the living animals, and has exhibited the savage manners and
habits d
drupeds, according to his own ideas and observations.
On
CHARACTER and EXPRESSION, we shall now deliver our opinion.
By the 0
we mean those permanencies of his look and features which he
always off
or umimpassioned state : by his Expression, the variations
of muscula
to which he is liable, as the storms of passion sweep
by, and his
mal circumstances acting on the ardours of his instinct.
The fort
in the solid and massy parts : the latter, agitates, oft-
times rebellio
Juscles. Character is ever present, both in the animal coun-
tenance, and
divine." The most violent expression does not proscribe, or
obliterate, chard
ht consists of it, as far as concerns external appearauce and it
forms the system
language of Nature, without which no Expression could be.
Whoever reg
a flock of Sheep, will see in them an infinite variety of Character,
with very little E:
it little without diversity : and if we descend a step lower in
the scale of being, and
be finny tribe, where Character is not wanting, we find no
Expression at all. Even Trees
and
ate objects, possess Character. We recollect a poetical
friend of ours, now in Italy, saying that ever tree and every rock had a free-bu of this we are
not so certain ; though very certain, that there is enough of Character in rocks and trees, to make
a poet think so.
Character and Expression, in the carnivorous class of animals, to which we here solicit
attention, are always co-existeut - their proportions varying with the existing occasions- -in
pictorial exhibitions of such subjects.
No. II.
THERE is much Character, and little Expression, in the reposing Leopard with his sheathed
claws, which is shewn in the present engraving, copied by Mr. from RIDINGER, and
corrected from Nature. RIDINGER was an artist of great power, who studied wild animals in
their sequestered haunts, as is shewn in his grand forest back-grounds : and who, generally
speaking, left little or no room for others to improve, except on some few of his inferiór works.
The present is an interesting and beautiful animal, vet there is a latent capability of mischief
characterised in his countenance, and we might ask, in the language of Job, " Who shall dare to
rouse him up ?"
