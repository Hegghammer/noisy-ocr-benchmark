THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
nothing before me nor beneath me, I mounted
upon something and walked across something.
Following him I went downward and into the
courtyard of the castle.
Within that courtyard there was a horse of brass
with a giant man of brass upon it, the giant man
holding a great bow in his hands. My master
said to ne, "If one came over the bridge of air
without IN authority, the arrow of that bow would
be loosened and he who came across the bridge
would be sla by this giant man of brass." We
went within the astle. In the hall were benches
and tables, and
e were statues holding torches
in their hands stan
g
by the wall. Also in that
hall there was the
se of a woman holding a
dart in her hand. W)
uy master came within,
the statue that held tl
rt flung it, and the
dart struck a gleaming ca
that was in the
wall. Lights came into
toi bes that the
statues held, and all the hall
;
light d up.
I sat with my master at a tab and the statues
moved to us, bringing us wine an ruits. Wate
and drank, and afterward a golden gure came 10
