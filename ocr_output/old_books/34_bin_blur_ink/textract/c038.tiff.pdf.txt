THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
But first the Enchanter showed me that great
wonder that was near the gardens - the Tower
of Babylon. It was a red tower mounting very
high into the air. Outside of it there were steps
that went round it and to the very top of
it -- a thousand steps. And on the top of
the tower, resting against the Spear of Nim
was the Magie Mirror of Babylon. Zak
Enchanter made me look to the to
as
made fearful by looking SO hish
Oh, that I might tell y
of the
wonders of the Tower
fow
of it there slept t
Genii
who guarded
Tarut and
they were
named mant beings they were.
S
they slept
there the beard of each was spréad across his
mighty chest, and it was a beard so broad that
no horse of the mighty horses that the King owned
could leap across it. Very great but very old
were Harut and Marut, the Genii who guarded
Babylon.
I was made fearful by looking to the top of the
tower. And then I was made still more fearful
