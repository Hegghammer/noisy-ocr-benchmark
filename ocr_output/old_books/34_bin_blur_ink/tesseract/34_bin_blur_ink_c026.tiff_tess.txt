THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
I went in and stood on the floor of our house my
heart was thumping within me at the thought of
what was before.
And there was the pot boiling over the fire with
a few green herbs in it. There was Saba, ymy
mother, stirring the last handful of meal amongst
the green herbs. And there w :
all older than I, sitting by the
the herbs and the meal to be ready:
When my mother looked toward 1
man from the strange boat. She ¢
some crime had been committed by me «
to bring a man of such high degree ai
She and my brothers were greatly afraid}
were poor, and those who were high we
to them. But the stranger spoke softly, |
“Good fortune has come to you from tl
to-day.” And when they all turned toward
he said, “IT who am very knowledgeable will t
your son with me as an apprentice, and I sh
instruct him in arts and crafts and mysteries.”
My mother said, “The boy is young, sir, and we
thought he would be with us for a time longer.”
