G CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

and carnivorous habits. They walk on their tues: yet not so much from that habitual stealthiness
of pace, by which they advance unperceived till within a spring of their prey ; as because it is also
the means ef that celerity of motion which is necessary to the very existence of animals that can
fleed only on flesh.

Their claws are exceeding # power they are enabled to draw them up into sheaths
between their toes, so as tofifr points from touching the ground; whence they are
called retractile ; and the cusequence, always kept sharp, unworn, and ready for
active service.

The eyes every face iv nature a striking and important feature—vary
in the different. sy capable of much alteration in the same animal; as instinctive
impulse, or internal P changes the expression of his countenance ; and also from the
degrees of light whj tpon their pupils. Of Lions the pupils of the eves are circular, and
not of a yellow Poas has been stated in the most diffuse modern dissertations on the
Carnivora, but It ix the iris of the Lion’s eve that is yellow, They appear to be best
suited to noet , or twilight, vision; and hence the Lion rarely hunts his prey while the sun
ix above thefMrizon—perhaps never, but when pressed by hunger in an extraordinary degree.
The Tiger Jf the contrary, will seek his prey by day as well as by night; und during twilight the
colour offs eyes is that of a blue-green flame. [fa stranger passes near a Tiger in a menagerie,
the colour of the animal's eves will sometimes alter suddenly, from yellow-green to blue-green ;
not from any alteration in the deeree of light actiny upon them, but from mental excitement, and
from a certain natural facility of expansion and contraction ef the eve-pupils.

Hence a characteristic difference betwee n the Lion and the Tiger. The habits of the latter
are diurnal, and he disregards night-fires : the Lion, on the contrary, whose eyes are not calculated
for the glare of day, cannot bear to encounter fire-light at night. Yet these physical conforma-
tious are sometimes overcome by the rage of hunger; and hence, in Mr. Epwin Lanpsven’s
contending group, the Lion is represented as attacking the Tiger although it be day.

Mr. Ber treats learnedly, and we believe with anuch originality, of the facial-museles of
this class of quadrupeds, in his “ Anatomy of Expression.”—We shall offer a few extracts, by
which the reader will perceive how limited are their powers of expression of countenance, when
compared with those of human nature, notwithstanding their superiority over all other quadrupeds,

“The violent: passions mark themselves so distinctly on the countenances both of men and
of animals, that we are apt inthe first instance to consider the movements by which they are
indicated, as certain sins or characters provided by Natnre, for the express purpose of intimating
the internal emotion ; and to suppose that they are interpreted by the observer iD consequence of a
pecuhar and instinctive faculty. This view of things, however, so natural at first sight, is not
altovether satisfactory to philosophy ; and a more jealous observation of the facts, seems to suggest
