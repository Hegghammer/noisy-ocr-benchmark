PREFACE

On the analogy of the famous apple,—‘‘there ain’t
going to be no’’ preface, ‘‘not nohow.’’ Children do
not read prefaces, so anything of a prefatory nature
that might interest them is put at the beginning of chap-
ter one. |

As for the grown-ups the story is not written ur grown- |
ups, and if they want to know why it begins ua 1 such a
gruesome first chapter, let them ask the chil i Hn. Chil-
dren like the horrors first and the end all bri. Many
grown-ups like the tragedy at the end. Buty aps the
children are right and the grown-ups are ing on
their heads. Besides they can skip the firs r; itis
only a prologue.
