2 CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS.

the scene of which, by the way, he has not represented as a royal menagerie, but as a wild,
rocky cavern—his animals partake of fhe artificial character of which we cannot bring ourselves to
approve.

Of this fact, however, we purpge to exhibit prgpf with our assertion. Improved versions, to
the best abilities of our Artists, of Joe of thes us of RuBENS and the Assyrian king, will here
be introduced, which the reader, Hho ply My compare with the originals. Our second, third,

The Lions of RUBENS ay We do not intend to discuss at length whether the
ideality of allegorical this: we only state the fact: yet the opinions which we
felt at liberty to fi , e feel at liberty to utter. So much in apology for using the
licence of assa@M™Me that the many of the Lions of Ru Bens rather resemble those of frowning
old gentlemen decorated w millies wigs yas if Nature’s journeymen had made mancs, and not
made them well. There profusion of flowmge and curling hair, which seems rather to solicit
the unguents of the pe er, than to have endured the torrid heats of the desert, or the rough
storms of the forest. fe shag of a Lion’s mane is a very different sort of thing,

However such dfezsed Lions may be thought to accord with Alievory, they are demonstrably
at variance with Nature. ‘To be sure, what might become a Lion in the procession of the Cardinal
Virtues, might be rather unsuitable in lis den, or within the precincts of those wild haunts, where he
is accustomed to roam in His uatural state. We have often read of the fabled Men-bulls, or (Mino-
taurs,) and we find such on the coinage of Crete. These allegorical creatures of RURENS, which,
alas! have sometimes been quoted by Artists without half his genius, and placed in savage con-
flicts, or beside their Britaunias —are a species of Men-lions. Placed among the Sabaan sculp-
tures, they might pass for incarnations of Sol in Leo; but would very ill pass for Leo alone.

Among the observers of this poetic improvement, or this natural and unpoetical deficieucy, on
the part of Rupens, Trriay, Jutio Romano, and other painters, both ancient and modern; and
of the consequent desideratim on the part of the public, of a cabinet or library collection of the
nobler wild animals ina state of Nature, so as to answer the purposes of reference, while they con-
duced to the pleasures of Taste, were Mr. Epcar Spinspury and Mr. THowas LAanpsren.
Whether or not the public “looked up to them for light” on that subject, (to use the language of
STERNE,) they thought the Public “deserved it;” and they therefore, as the best: practical means
of eliciting that light, first copied the general forms and attitudes of most of the wild animals that
appear in this book, from the old masters—generally speaking, from works that are well known
—and then, went to Nature and corrected the details. They carried with them what, in those
ancient masters, was meritorious in composition, attitude and chiaroscuro, and brought away,
to the best of their ability—superadding it to, and blending it with, the above—nceuracy of
detail.
