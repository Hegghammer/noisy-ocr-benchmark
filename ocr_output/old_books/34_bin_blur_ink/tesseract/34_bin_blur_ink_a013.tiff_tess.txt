WHY AND AHEEREPORIE,

la making a study of my race, DhaWiound three marked characteristics
Intelligence —Energy—tIndustry. Combi vith these three characteristics
is an intense Love of Nationality. We a complex world. Tn an
independent people these characteristics a S senument are laudglse
Virtues. Ina subject people they are Crime:

After Thad laid this bitter Truth to heart, Beek for the
Why and Wherefore of the Armenian Massacrd

The Armenian Massacres stand without allelin history. “The
iiman mind stageers to contemplate the orgies of which they have
been the victims, and no pen can desgg cir horrors: and this’ helpless
christian people are to-day in the é deadly peril as they have been since
the famous ‘Treaty of Berlin siened them bound hand and foot to the
mercy of their executionge®

The Armenians may be led again ‘as sheep to the slaughter” and the
work of extermination may be completed—Jesus Christ was crucified on
Calvary and the servant ts not ereater than his Lord—but the work of their
extermination can ealy be completed when the evil induences in the Turkish
Ienapire have reached their calminating point. Hitherto the Powers of
leurope have by their jealousies and rivalries cultivated these evil intiuences,
they have watered them and made them grow, but when their culminating
point. is reached, they must react on Christendom and the natural
consequence must follow. Those who sow the wind, must reap the whirl-
wind. Ttis in the natural order of things.

I will allow that Liberty, Justice, Equality, Fraternity are the watchwords
of Young Turkey, but Young Turkey is only a small minority ; the creat
majority of the Turkish nation are not Younes Turks.

The question theretore resolves itselfinto this criucal point: “What wiil
Christendom do even now?”
