CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. 3

Tivery artist does best, that which he is best qualified and best disposed to do. In com-
pletite the number of plates that has been found necessary for the Work, Mr. Epwix LaNDSEER
haz c¥en to proceed toward the same purpose, upon a different principle. He has gone, without
any in ry medium, directly to the living animals, and has exhibited the savage manners and
habits upeds, according to his own ideas and observations.

© On yeen CHARACTER and Expression, we shall now deliver our opinion.
By the Wwe mean those permanencies of his look and features which he
always off r unimpassioned state: by his /-rpression, the variations
of muscul: to which he is liable, as the storins of passion sweep
by, and his al circumstances acting on the ardours of his instinct.

The for in the solid and magssy parts: the latter, agitates, oft-
times rebellio uscles. Character is ever present, both in the animal coun-
tenance, and divine.” The most violent expression does not proscribe, or
obliterate, char: ity consists of it, as far as concerns external appearance ; and it
forms the syster » languave of Nature, without which no Expression could be.

Whoever ree ya flock of Sheep, will see in them an infinite variety of Character,
with very little 1 t little without diversity: and if we descend a step lower in
the scale of being, anc ve finny tribe, where Character is not wanting, we find no
Expression at all. Liven Trees at ate objects, possess Character. We recollect a poetical
friend of ours, now in Ttaly, saying that eveMMtree and every rock had a fiee—but of this we are
not so certain; thouch very certain, that there is enough of Character in rocks and trees, to inake
a poet think so.

Character and Expression, in the carnivorous class of animals, to which we here solicit
attention, are always co-existent — their proportions varying with the existing occasions —in
pictorial exhibitions of such subjects.

. No. TI.

Tree is much Character, and lite Expression, in the reposing Leopard with his sheathed
claws, which is shewn in the present engraving, copied by Mr. Srirspery from Ripincen, and
corrected from Nature. RipinGer was an artist of great power, who studied wild animals in
their sequestered haunts, as is shewn in his grand forest back-grounds + and who, generally
speaking, left little or no room for others to improve, except on some few of his inferiér works.
The present is an interesting and beautiful animal, vet there is a latent capability of mischief
characterised in his countenance, and we might ask, in the language of Job, “ Who shall dare to
rouse him up 2?”
