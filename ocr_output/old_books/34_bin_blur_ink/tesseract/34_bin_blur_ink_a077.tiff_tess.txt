I will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amiasia,
and relate the story of King Aram, who ended Is brilliant reign in B.C.
1796 after ruling over Armenia filty-cight vears.

He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his dominions, and
grew to be so mighty in battle that the neighbouring nations called his
country Aramia and the people were called Aramins, such names as
Armenia or Armenians being no doubt later corruption

The tirst victory of Aram was over Neuchar kit ‘dia, whom he
took prisoner and put to death, and made a large p: © country of the

religion, coming tron. Norther ettng in the region between
the western boundaries of Babylonia and thehighlands of Western .\sia ”
were no other than the Hai who under their Ning Aram had spread thew
conquests and their kingdom into Mesopotamia and even to the shores of
the Mediterranean.

Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when he includes
Northern Mesopotamia, together with the mountainous country of Ararat,
under the name of Armenia, and in writing of the Armenian boats that
brought merchandise to Babylon, be remarks that they were constructed in
Armenia, fn tre farts above clssyrta.

Archvological researches have laid the claim that the modern Armenians
are the descendants of the old Hittites ; the modern Armenian being supposed
