CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS. 3
No. VI.

Ix this Grocp by Mr. Epwin Lanpserer there is much of violent animal Expression, and
Character fades before it, or rather, 13 absorbed in it. It tells a story of the past as well as the
present, and 13 preenant with a catastrophe not difficult to anticipate from the actions and
expressions of the parties engaged. A Fawn has been seized by a Leorarp, who has been
despoiled of his pretWyy 2 more powerful Tiger. The Tiger in his turn becomes the victim of an
enraged Lion. - .

The expression of the Wggded Leopard is that of painful suffering mingled with dread.

Although our main purpose be to exhibit rather a pictorial than a physiological view of the
subject: having descanted on the word Character, we shall probably be expected to add, at least
a word or two, on the leading characteristics of the carnivorous class of quadrupeds.

The generic characters of the Teline, or Cat, kind, are easily enumerated in the concise
language of the naturalists. Their heads are round; their visages short: they have six cutting
teeth, and two canine, in either jaw: their tongues are aculeated, the prickles inclining backward ;
their claws sharp, hooked, and retractile ; their ears small and acuminated ; they have five toes on

~ each of the fore-feet, and four only on those behind.

Of this genera of Cats, we here exhibit the four principal species, Lions, ‘Tigers, Leopards,
and Panthers, of which the Lion is justly placed at the head —at least, the unanimous voice of ages
has pronounced him to be the king of beasts, and we have enthroned him accordingly in our Title-
page, (No. J.) They form a tribe that is especially and properly Carnivorous, being the only
class of quadrupeds that are exclusively flesh-eaters. Their jaws are very completely armed. for
this purpose ; their canine teeth being very long and angular, with the edges of the angles turned
toward the inside of their mouths ; so that when the animal has caused them to meet, or cross each
other in the flesh of its prev, these formidable teeth will cut or tear a way through, by drawing

Their claws, and the formation of their feet, too, are eminently conducive to their predacious
