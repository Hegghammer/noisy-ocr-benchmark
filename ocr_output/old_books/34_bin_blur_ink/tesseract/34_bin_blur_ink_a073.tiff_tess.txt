“God shall colarge Japhet and he shall dwell ta the tents of Shem, and
Canaan shall be Iis servant.”

For the interpretation of this blessing of Noah's to his ctdest son, and
ot how it may or may not have met with its falmiment, [shall leave to
theologians to discuss, and only record it here as a quotauon from Genesis.
Beyond the story of Yis connection with the teed, and this bessiag with
which his father blessed him, and the genealogy of his sons, we read nothig

where Noah planted his vineyard, and round the base of that mountain trom
whence his descendants began to spread and people the earth.

Tradition has woven a romance round the names of towns and villages
