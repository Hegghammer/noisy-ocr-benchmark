THE BOY APPRENTICED TO AN ENCHANTER
came on without sails or oars. It was a shining
boat, a boat of brass. I called to my father and
my father straightened himself up and watched it.
In the boat that came toward us of its own accord
there was 4 man standing.

The boat came into the full water between the
rocks, and then it sank down, this boat of brasgiin-
til its rim touched the water. It remained s s
if anchored. The man who was in the prow
boat stepped out on the sand between my
and me.

He looked a man of high
or a potentate. He had a dar
curly beard, and he had eyes that w
eyes. He had on a. straight coat a
material covered all over with curious figures,
and in his hand he held a long polished staff
that had the shape of two serpents twisting to-
gether. He Jooked at me and J was frightened of
him, and I turned to my father. But my father
was standing there, holding the fishing pole in
his hands, his mouth open, gasping like one of the
fishes upon the rocks.
