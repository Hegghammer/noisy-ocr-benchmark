Can the Armenians hope now for any change in their condition under
‘Turkish rule?) To this question, we must answer an emphatic No!

Vhe causes that must operate against any chenge are many and deep-
seated. Ta the first place it cannot be expected that a few Turks of liberal
ideas (or it may be French polished) at Constantinople, are going to chanze
the thought and character of the natin. The characteristics of a people
chanee very slowly, if they ever change at all, and the predomiagmt national
traits of the many-blocded modern Turk have been shown tgyAthe world to
be, cruelty and fanaticism, combined with a tierce sensiayg® > and what is
more than all, and which has to be remembered most, yGMthat they are a
people accustomed to the unbridled gratification of the @FRorset passions.

Phe cthnographic traits of the Turkman whig tory bears out, are
whdness and flerceness, and it would not be ineg to argue that with the
instincts of hts primitive ancestors have becy milated the many cross
currents that run in hts) veins, tnte all vich has been infused the
doctrines of the religion of the sword, a no which Coes not make for
the peace or well beme of mankind yg also, which assigning one of
the two sexes to the degraded posi sted solely tor the gross
pleasure of the other, does not 1 { stanankind.

To quote again the em@tnt y ferred to: ' No
Mahominedan race or dy ng@& has vovern weil
even subjects of its owfFeligion APerichts to subjects of
a different creed is to@idden by ery law of its being.”

Not the Jewis conceit proclaiming itself God's clect and chosen, and
originating the name “heathen which it scorned. Not the Christian conceit
cimanating from the Jewish source, and laying the flattering unction to its
soul of superiority over the “heathen "of its own time. Not the unbending
vaste exclusiveness of the Brahman across whose path even the shadow of
the despised Sudra falling would be deemed detilement. Not any of these,
can equal the intolerant religious pride of the Mahommedan, or reach tie
pmnacle of religious selfsufticiency on which he has seated himself. “Vo be
a Mahommedan, is enough— Cela suffit.

To any one who has familiar acquaintance with Mahonimedans, and
inumate with Mahommedan thought, one fact must strike itself most forcibly,
and that is, the Mahemmedan is above all things a Mahommedan. His
ichgion is the paramount question in his life, and remains its predominating
feature above everything else. This should not be surprising, since to the
faithful” Paradise is secured, and all crimes and transgressions against
“unbelievers” absolved.
