Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, tnilucaces of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in ‘Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt; this super-added evi, is, the
large neigbouring bodies ot Kurds and Circassians, greater marauders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation of whose lives comprise~
murder and robbery, and who have throush weary centuries unreniuttingly
quartered themselves upon the industrious christian peasants, ang lived on
the fruits of thetr labour and toil. Indeed as the Hamidich ry waich
was established expressly fer the Hemidian massacres osed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation what rriors,
trained and practised in organized inurder, can now fin bits in
which they were cocourazed and trained to ind udian
récune.

Under all such conditions no hope ot bette Mines
no prospect of better times seems possible, for f the
Armenian race whom torce of circumstances the
fatherland.

The appoiatment of Christian governors 0 in
habited by them might ameliorate some of the evils, o tive,
of allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespe or
nationality, would furnish some means of selfdefence aids
and barbarities of the oppressors; but even if such concessi ted,
life for the christian peasant subject to Turkish rule, and livir idst
of his ene nies, must ramain one long strugele and battle avs we,
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature. Notthe tile
soil, not the most tavourable climatic conditions, not the most ! us
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, can bring he
Armenian peasant under ‘Turkish rule even a modicum of that comfirt,
happiness, and security of life and property, which the law of all cialWd
countrics euarantees to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil.
