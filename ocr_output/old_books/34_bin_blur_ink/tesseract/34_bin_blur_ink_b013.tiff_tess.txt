: CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS,
DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.

Tat there has hitherto existed no good book of Engravines of the nobler wild animals,
to assist the provress of the student in that department of Art, is to be reeretted. The talents
of Mr. JouN@M&corr, brought ito action by those of Ginrinx, Cooper, and the REINAGLES,
have presen public with excellent representations of the distinguished ornaments of the
turf: the s > field, and the habits and manners of the canine race, were also duly
honoured: | cous Tiger sribe, and the lordly Liox, we have nothing extant that
would bea 1 Pond a few detached prints:—nothing like a collection. of
ficures, Ww mecuracy of form, action, character, and expression, might be
relied on.

Does eader imagine that the various Etchings which have been performed—chietly
abroad —U¥ Artists of no mean ability, may be considered as exceptions? They are not exceptions :
or at best, the muinber which might be so regarded is but small, and those, for the most part, of
dimensions not accommodated to the drawer of the cabinet, or the shelf of the library.

But they are not objectionable on this eround alone. Speaking of them in the averecate, the

which are the ends of Art. Even those after Trrtan and after Rupes (the latter of whom has
perhaps painted a greater nuinber than any other of the old masters) are fir more deficient in
form, character, and expression, than is generally supposed, or than will be easily believed, by
those who have not actually compared them with the Lions, Leopards, and Tigers of Nature.
They have been taken too much on the credit which attaches to the great names of their authors.
—Nor is this intended to impugn the merits, as historical or poetical painters, of those distincuished
Artists, but simply as an assertion of truth. It is possible, that as a painter of allegory, RuBENS
might consider that strong infusion of /aaman form, character, and expression, by which his Lions,
for example, are distinguished, as necessary, or conducive, to his allegorical purposes ; or, it is pos-
sible that his knowledge of this animal may not have been thoroughly well-grounded, and that he
may have laboured under early prejudice of mind, cr of vision, in this part of his education as a
Painter, and may not have seen Lions as they really are. This is what the writer is most inclined
to believe, (though not to insist); for even in treating the subject of Daniel in the den of Lions—
