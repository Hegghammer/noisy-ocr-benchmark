On the field the ever victortous army of little Japan undermined Russia‘s
stronghold, and succeeded in driving back and ever driving back the ever
defeated and ever retreaune army of colossal Russia. At sea the ever
victorious Japanese lleet s#Xceeded in completely annihilating the Russian
leet. It was war such he world had never yet seen. “The secret of
such astounding successes tobe investigated, and here [beg leave to
quote from one of a sq ticles in which | gave view to my opinions
during the Russo-Japang ‘Japan may be likened to the bundle of
faggots in the fable firn ie: one faveot of larger dimensions in
the centre, the sovere] y the whole nation clusters, and all,
tuler and people tied nune bands of patriotism.”

Vhese remarks « 2 observations of actual facts. In
national unity Japan son to the world; she furnishes
an ¢xample which t id which a nation so politically
forlorn as ourselve s to copy.

From the ast 18 turn to the position the
Great Republic sccupies in the world, and
take the lesson t lish as we contrast their
present position ritan pilgrims occupied
when they first e hundred years ago.

National te yner Which we must
raise up over Natiom engraven on the
tablets of o1 ob in the p rts. There are
mountains o re_us, and if ever h the goal we
can only de id tovether like the b veots in the
fable, with Por loosening of the bands. verhaps we
micht one Poe able to get an independent footing on ute orical soil
of our fathers, and perhaps once more rally round our own flag S&\ Japan-
ese lives for the State, not for himself; we have no State for which to live,
but tet us live for our communities whilst we keep the hope in our hearts
that communities grow into States.

We have grit and endurance in ao unparalleled degree, but these
characteristics will profit us nothing if we are wanting in unity.

Let us remember that utterance of the Founder of our faith. In our
loyalty and allegiance to Him our life-blood has flowed like the torrents of a
cataract, but we must remember His warning utterance :—

“What shall it profit a man.” What shall it profit a nation. Unity is
the soul of a nation, Let us keep our scul and not lose it.
