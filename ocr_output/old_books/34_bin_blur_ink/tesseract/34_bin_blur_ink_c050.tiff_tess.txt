city and toward the great market place. Throngs
of people would be there, gathered together for
buying or selling, or for talk of the happenings
of the day before. My master would take me to
a shady place, and we would sit there, resting or
refreshing ourselves with draughts of the wine of

of Babylon. We 4 > here, and we
