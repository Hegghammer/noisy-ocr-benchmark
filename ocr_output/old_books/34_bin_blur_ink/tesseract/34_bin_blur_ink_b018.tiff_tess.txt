held in a state of tranguillity. Here, too, ig@t much Expression, but an extraordinary grandeur
of Character, suited to the greatness 0 occasion where the Deity himself especially interferes
to seal up the voracious energies nost terrible of his creatures, in calm submission. There
is acharacter of royal dignity dwith this submission, which is very impressive, and even
sublime.

Pik TiGeR WHICH MARCHES IN OUR PROCESSION, Without an object before him to call
forth emotion, possesses a calm character, combined with the resistless strength of that dreadfal
quadraped ; whose very tranquillity, in his leisure sauntering, when no excitement is acting on his
nerves, has an appalling effect. —His brow is clouded, though his claws are sheathed. There is a
possibility of a dreadful storm which may not be far distant, and that. is enough to stamp the
Tiger’s character. None shall dare to arouse his energies, nor to encounter them when aroused.

THIS GROUP OF PLAYFUL LEOPARDS, AFTER RUBENs, must be supposed to belong to the
jocund train of Bacchus, since they are luxuriating at their ease, among grapes and vine branches.
These Leopards are doubtless intended to have a degree of playful expression—induced perhaps by
the exhilarating juice of the grape: and we should “ guess” (as Jonathan says) that this group

was studied from a litter of half-grown kittens. Few, however, except the sailors who were
accustomed to cambol with the Tiger-cub on board the Pitt East-Indiaman, would like to venture
to frolic rith them.
