“Can you imagine the feelings of the Kessab people as they climbed on foot the long trai!
up the monitain, and then as they came over the ridge into full view of their charred and
ruined dwellings? Their stores of wheat, barley and rice had been burned ; clothing, cooking
utensils, furniture and tools had gone; their goats, cows and mules had been stolen; their silk
industries stamped out; their beloved churches reduced to smouldering heaps. The bodies of
their friends and relatives who had been killed had not been buried. And yet the love of
home is so strong that the people have settled down there with the determination to clear up
the debris and gebaild their houses.”—Extracts from "The Sack of Kessab,” Stephen Van R.

Mush, a prosperous Armenian village that had
escaped the des na the massacres, has been plundered in a night attack
by armed Kurds, an villagers are now reduced to extreme distress. Before
the outbreak the Ardenian patriarchal vicar at Mush had repeatedly appealed
to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople, and the Armenian Patriarch
had repeatedly appealed to the Authorities at Constantinople asking protec-
tion for the villagers of Mush as a Kurdish attack was apprehended. It is
evident that the authorities at Constantinople are unable to protect thriving
Armenian villages from Kurdish and Turkish raiders.
