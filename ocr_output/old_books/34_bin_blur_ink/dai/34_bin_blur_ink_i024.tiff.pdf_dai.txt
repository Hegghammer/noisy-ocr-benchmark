THE LUSITANIA'S LAST VOYAGE
the voyage.
I!
you want to read a piece
of vitriolic English, I suggest that you send
for a cop:
Where I stood on deck the shock of the
impact was not severe, it was a heavy
rather muflled sound, but the good ship
trembled for a moment ander the force of
the blow, a second explosion, quickly fol-
lowed, but I do not think it was a second
torpedo, for the sound was quite different,
it was more likely a boiler in the engine too?
Av I turned to look in the direction of the
explosion I saw a shower of coal and steam
and some d√©bris hurled into the air between
the second and third funnels, and then hed
the fall of gratings and other wrecka
had been blown up by the explosio
Remember that I was standi:
on the port side, and con
back at the scene of the
across to the starbox
