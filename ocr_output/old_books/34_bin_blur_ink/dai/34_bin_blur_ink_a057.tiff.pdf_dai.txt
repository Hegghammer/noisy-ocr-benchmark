thorough gentleman in every sense of the word. When peace was concluded between Turkey
and Russia, and preparations were being made for the Berlin Congress, it was he who, in
spite of the feared fanatical aprising of the Turks, threw prudence to the winds and took
a step that will long be remembered in the anuals of Armenian history,
At the first meeting of the Berlin Congress the Turkish delegates were thunderstruck to
learn from official sources that an Armenian delegation had arrived from Constartin-ple, sent
by Monseigneur Nercès, the Patriarch, their object Leing to request the signatory Powers of
the Berlin Treaty to forec a guarantee from the Turkish Government to make certain
important improvements in Armenia.
Abdul Hamid and his advisers were furious at this affront, and Monseigneur Nercès was
summoned to the Palace, It is said that when he received the summons he simply smiled
and asked one of of his carates to read the Burist Savice to him, he did not expect to
return alive. However, he went. No one has ever heard what pressed between the Sultan
and himself at the interview ; suffice it to say that he immediatel samtioned the Armenian
General Assembly and tendered his resignation. This was not accepted by the Assembly,
and, amidst enthusiastic cheers, Le was carried Lack to his apartments at the Patriarchate
Meanwhile a peremptory order reached him, signed by the altan, to recall the Armenian
delegation from Berlin." This Monseignear Varjabétian point-blank refused to de, and retired
to his private residence at Haskeny, a village on the Golan Horn. The success of the dele-
gation, however, did not come up to his expectations, Armenians, as it happened, could
not be heard, hat they were so far successful as to ha article inserted in the treaty.
The Sultan and his advisers never forgave
they could not
openly do anything to him on account of his en

all appearance the incident was forgotten, but it
almer afternoon a most
cordial invitation was sent by a very high dig
requesting the Archbishop
to dine with him informally. An invitation
not very well be refused, so
the Archbishop, accompanied only by a bod
d Vartan, repaired to the Pasha's
house. The Pasha received him at the do

extreme courtesy to a private apartment aamlik of his house (the men's quarters),
where dimer was served. The genialit displayed by his host dispehod any fears that the
Archbishop might have had as to his personal safety,
After dinner, as usual, coffee was served. Now, this serving of the coffee is rather a
ceremonial according to high Turkish etiquette, and it is not umsal for guests to bring their
own tehoobsulday (the servant who carries his master's pipe and pouch and also superintends
the making of his coffee). The Archbishop was presented with a tehoobouk " (pipe) tilled
and lighted for smoking, and a servant followed with coffee. The Archbishop accepted both
with dae compliments to his host, and took a sip at his coffee. Just at that moment the
heavy curtains over the doorway were thrown apart, revealing the glastly pale face of his
servänt Vartan, who cried, in Armenian, in a voice trembling with emotion,"“Monseigneur,
E did not brew the coffee!"
This was enough for the Archbishop; he pretended to be startle i and spilt the coffee, but,
alas! he had already drank a small quantity of it. Meanwhile a seuille was going on behind

the Pasha for his generous and kind hospitality and took his departure. On the way home he
was taken violently ill and a doctor was hastily samm-med. The Patriarch took to his bed,
and lost all his hair through the effects of the prison. Then, one morning, when a servant
