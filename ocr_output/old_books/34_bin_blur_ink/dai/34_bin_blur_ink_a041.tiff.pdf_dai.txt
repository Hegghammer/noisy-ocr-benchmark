Khrimian, Katholikos of the Armenian Church, and soul of the Armenian people—slowly
approaching to death, lay in the ancient monastery called Etchmiatzin, or “The Only-Begotten
is Descended." From the window of a neighboring room he might have looked across the
frost bound plain of the Araxes, where the vines were now all cat close and buried for the
winter. Beyond the plain stood a dark mass of whirling snow and hurricane that hid the
cone of Ararat. And just beyond Ararat Tes Lake Van, last puddle of the Deluge. On the
shore of that lake, eighty-seven years ago, Khrimian was born. În 1820 the Turkish
Empire was still undiminished by sea or land; the Sultan still counted as one of the formid-
able Powers of Europe. It was four years before Byron set out to deliver Grecce from his
tyranny, and established for England a reputation as the generous champion of freedom -a
reputation which still rather pathetically savives thoughout the Near East. Long and
stormy had been the life upon which the Katholikos now Boked

and

beforehand, urging them to create an autonomous neutral state for Armenia, as they had
done with saccess for the Lebanon. In London he became acquainted with Gladstone ; but
Gladstone was then only the blazing firebrand which had kindled the heart of England, and,

Article 61, pledging the Powers, and especially England, to hold the Kurds in check and
enforce Turkey's definite reforms. It is needless to say that none of these promises and
pledges were observed. Beaconsfield returned to London amid shouts of “Peace with Honor,"
and Armenia was left to stew.
So it went on. Detained in Constantinople as prisoner, banished to Jerusalem for
rebellion, and finally chosen Katholikos, or head of his Church and race, by his own people, he
maintained the hopeless contest. Year by year the woe increased, till by the last incalculable
crime (1894-1896), the Armenians were slaughtered like sheep from the Bosporus to Lake
