y which
Added to these important factors of racial characteristics, influences of
religion, and long grown habits of the Turk, we have also in Turkish
Armenia another evil, from which the other provinces of the Turkish Empire
fortunately for themselves have been exempt; this super-added evil, is, the
large neigbouring bodies of Kurds and Circassians, greater marauders and
depredators than the Turks, the regular occupation of whose lives comprise-
murder and robbery, and who have through weary centuries unremittingly
quartered themselves upon the industrious christian peasants, and lived on
the fruits of their labour and toil. Indeed as the Hamidich
was established expressly for the Hamidian massacres y osed of
these Kurds, it ought to be matter of speculation what
arriors,
trained and practised in organized murder, can now ng
bits in
which they were encouraged and trained to ind
hidian
r√©gime.
Under all such conditions no hope of better
ming,
no prospect of better times seems possible, for
of the
Armenian race whom torce of circumstances
of the
fatherland.
The appointment of Christian governors of
in-
habited by them might ameliorate some of the evils, on
tive,
of allowing the use of arms to all alike, irrespec,
nationality, would furnish some means of self-defence
aids
and barbarities of the oppressors; but even if such concession
ted,
life for the christian peasant subject to Turkish rule, and livit
idst
of his enemies, must remain one long struggle and battle aga
murder, depredation, and offences of the worst nature.
Not the tile
soil, not the most favourable climatic conditions, not the most
industry, not the most peace loving, law abiding instincts, can bring he
Armenian peasant under Turkish rule even a modicum of that com rt,
happiness, and security of life and property, which the law of all civiled
countries guarantees to the industrious labourer and tiller of the soil.
