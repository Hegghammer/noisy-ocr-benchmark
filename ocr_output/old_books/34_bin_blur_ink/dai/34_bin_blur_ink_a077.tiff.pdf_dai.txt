I will again pass over the periods ruled by the successors of Amasia,
and relate the story of King Aram, who ended his brilliant reign in B.C.
1796 after ruling over Armenia fifty-eight years.
He was a great and powerful prince, and extended his dominions, and
grew to be so mighty in battle that the neighbouring nations called his
country Aramia and the people were called Aramians, such names as
Armenia or Armenians being no doubt later corruption
The first victory of Aram was over Neuchar kin edia, whom he
took prisoner and put to death, and made a large pa e country of the
defeated prince tributary to his own. The second
of Aram was over
Barsham king of Babylon, whom also he took per and put to death.
The next victory was over the king of Capp

the western boundaries of Babylonia and the highlands of Western Asia
were no other than the Hai who under their King Aram had spread their
conquests and their kingdom into Mesopotamia and even to the shores of
the Mediterranean.
Herodotus also rather corroborates this conjecture when he includes
Northern Mesopotamia, together with the mountainous country of Ararat,
under the name of Armenia, and in writing of the Armenian boats that
brought merchandise to Babylon, he remarks that they were constructed in
Armenia, in the parts above Assyria.
Archeological researches have laid the claim that the modern Armenians
are the descendants of the old Hittites ; the modern Armenian being supposed
