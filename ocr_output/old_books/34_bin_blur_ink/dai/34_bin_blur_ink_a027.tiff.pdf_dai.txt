honored the Ottoman father land that race was the Armenian. It is the Armenians who
wear most nearly the national dress, who speak and write Turkish best, and recognize the
Ottoman coltutry as their fatherland. Besides this it is the Armenians who engage in
commerce and agricalture, and thus, by demonstrating its fruitfulness, increase the yue of
