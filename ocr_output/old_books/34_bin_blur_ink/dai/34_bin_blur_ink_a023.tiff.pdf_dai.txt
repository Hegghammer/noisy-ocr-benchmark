can guarantee that these same fiends incarnate have become metamorphosed
and changed all of a sudden; or that the handful of liberal Turks at Con-
stantinople are capable of controlling and restraining them. We have not
even heard that the leaders and participators of the last massacres have
been punished as they deserved; and what is the reason they are left un-
punished because the Government is afraid to punish Mahommedans for
killing Christians; because the liberal Turks dare not punish the "true

between the two races, the oppressor and the oppressed.
thousands of Armenian women, thousands upon thousands Armenian
children, have been hounded to death, or savagely, fereciously, orribly and
loathsomely maltreated by the Turk, and yet in all the agonizing years when

one single instance of a Turkish woman or child maltreated by Armenians ?
The last massacres though especially organized from the Palace at
Constantinople, were officially announced to originate from an affray
between one Armenian and three Turks, in which the single handed one, on
the one side, grappling with the three on the other, killed one of the three :
given equal numbers and arms, the Armenian is always a match for the
Turk, but alas for him that unequal numbers and want of arms have always
made him the victim of his oppressor.
