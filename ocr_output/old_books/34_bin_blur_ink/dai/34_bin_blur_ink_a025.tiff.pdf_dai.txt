that followed : In the following June serious trouble arose at Van, where
some sort of insurrection is said to have been planned, though in the discre-
pancy of the accounts it is hard to arrive at the truth. Masses Kurds
came down threatening to massacre the Christians, and a conilt in which
many innocent persons perished, was with difficulty brought an end by
the intervention of the British Consul. A httle later the menian revolu-
tionary party, emboldened by the rising in Crete, where Christians, being
well armed and outnumbering the Muslims, held the found successfully,
