took his breaktast apstairs he found, to his horror, that both the bedroom door and the
window were wide open and his beloved master lay dead in his bed, which was covered with
blood! There are no such things as coroners and juries in Turkey to ascertain the causes of
mysterious deaths of this kind, but the news that the Patriarch was dead spread like wildüre
thraugh Constantinople. The Sultan himself thought it advisable to show some concern in
the matter, and aides-de-camp from the Palace were sent to the Patriarchate to learn the full
details of this "sad catastrophe," as they termed it. The official statement was that the
Archbishop died of dysentery. Only a very few know how the Archbishop had died, and
they wisely kept the i mouths shut.
I was told the details of this story by a high officia the Armenian Patriarchate. It
seems that as the poison did not act as quickly as the viarch's enemies had anticipatel,
owing to his having been cautioned in the nick of tiny
had to resort to other means
The funeral was the largest ever witnessed in C
ple, with an escort of Turkish
cavalry sent specialiy by the Saltan, and represen
the religions denominations
and the Diplomatic Corps. I was myself presen
foreign Government.
