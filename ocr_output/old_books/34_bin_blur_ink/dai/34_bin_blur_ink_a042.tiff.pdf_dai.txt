mute appeal, as 1 saw them, possessing nothing in the world but the variegated tatters
that cover them, and their faith in their Katholik . Showly they are drafted away into

Some of the bishops and monks, who form a counell and their chief, still look for
Europe's interference, and trust that the solema pledges taken by England and other Powers
at Berlin may be fulfilled. The Bishop of Erivan, for instance, still labors for the appoint-
ment of a Christian governor over the district marked by the ill-omened names of Van, Bitlis,
and Enzer√∞um. I also found that even among the Georgians there was a large party willing
to concede all the frontier district from Erivan to Kars, where Armenian villages are thickest,
as an autonomous Armenian province, in the happy day when the Cancasus wins federal
autonomy. Bat the majority of the Armenian clergy, who hitherto have led the people, are
beginning to acquiesce in the hopelessness of political change, and are now limiting their
efforts to education and indastries. One cannot yet say how far their influence may be
surpassed in the growing revolationary parties of The Bell" and "The Flag." Of these,
the Social Democratic Bell " follows the usual impracticable and pedantic creed of St. Marx.
The Flag," or party of Nationalist Democrats, is at present dominant, and at a great
assembly held in Erivan last August (1906) they adopted a programme of land nationalization,
universal suffrage and education, an eight-hour day, and the control of the Church property
by elected lavmen. If the Russian revolution makes good progress, they will naturally unite
with the Georgian Federalists, on whom the best hopes of the country are set.
Whatever may be the political fature of the Armenians, they seem likely to survive for
many generations yet as a race, held together by language and religion, Except the Jews,
there is, I think, no parallel to such a survival. It is a thousand years since they could be
